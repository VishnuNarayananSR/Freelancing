3:50 Ayr,2021-04-16T15:50:00+01:00,2 experts,58%,9 comments,4,Defining Battle,26,3.75,46,Theatre Legend,EW,JackpotRod,13.00,"Theatre Legend could be worth chancing here if you run a line through form for with Pay The Piper and Camprond. Defining Battle is Fav based on lines with Camprond, and the latter running well at Aintree. Camprond was beaten by Pay The Piper previously by 24L giving away 3lbs, and Pay The Piper was subsequently beaten by Theatre Legend giving away 9lbs. Its a complicated one to follow, but I do think it rates Theatre Legend a decent enough chance to be over priced here despite the upside of the top two in the market. I think Defining Battle will certainly need to improve a fair chunk to win, and is turned out relatively quickly. The selection took a similar route to winning at this meeting in 2019, is 6/11 a place over Hurdles, and has a decent record on good ground. Oakley Brown takes of 5lbs so eradicated the 4lb rise and some, and he has placed 1st/2nd on 7 of his last 10 starts.",2 experts,42,5yo,11-5,D Skelton,Harry Skelton,26,0,4,,,,,,

However mainly for a place and with a remote chance of the victory i will go for this one Each Way. The drop back in trip added to the 5lb drop in the weights definitely make this one tempting proposition, Connections are going OK - i know its risky but i will make this one my NAP.

In fact the easy win at a mile last time out can be upgraded since she'll be much better upped in trip and it's also interesting that Gosden targets this race with similar types having won this race in 3 of the last 5 years.,2 experts,2218-,3yo,9-4,Sir Michael Stoute,R L Moore,14,1,4,,,,,,
