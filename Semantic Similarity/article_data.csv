0,1,targeted threat,Pearson Park: Arrests after man 'assaulted with weapons',9 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-56335459,"Residents were evacuated from their homes as police attempted to arrest two men suspected of being involved in an armed assault.
People living near Pearson Park in Hull were temporarily asked to leave on Monday night ""for their safety"", said Humberside Police.
The force was responding to reports of two men attacking a third with ""weapons"" on nearby Newland Avenue.
Police later detained two men at a property close to the park.
The pair were arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after a man suffered head injuries.
They remain in police custody.
Two other men were also arrested in connection with the incident, which police said happened at 17:00 GMT.
A spokesperson for the force said: ""This is believed to be a targeted assault, with no wider threat to the public.""

2,3,targeted threat,DUP's Gregory Campbell targeted in death threat,24 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-30175412,"DUP MP Gregory Campbell has been told by police of a serious death threat, his party press office has said.
Party leader Peter Robinson said it was ""an attack on democracy itself"".
Mr Campbell said: ""This is not the first time that my life has been put under threat by republicans, and the challenge now is whether those who supported the threats in the past will condemn those who do it now.
""If they do, it is an indication that we have indeed moved on.""
He added: ""I will not be dictated to or deflected by terrorists.""
At the weekend, Mc Campbell told delegates his party would treat Sinn Fein's ""entire wish list"" as no more than toilet paper.
He also said: ""We will never agree to your Irish language act.""
Speaking earlier, Mr Robinson claimed Mr Campbell's words were ""a bit of comedy"" in the middle of the conference.
On Monday, Sinn FÃ©in minister John O'Dowd said his speech threatened the integrity of recent talks and called on Mr Robinson to be clear about the DUP position.
As news of the death threat broke, Mr O'Dowd expressed sympathy for Mr Campbell.
""My thoughts are with him and his family,"" he said.
""I know the effect on himself and his family.""
In a statement, a police spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on specific threats, however if we receive information that an individual may need to review their security, we will take steps to inform them immediately.""",Yes
3,4,targeted threat,DUP councillor George Duddy's home targeted in second graffiti threat,20 September 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24171380,"Threatening graffiti has been sprayed on the home of DUP councillor and leading Orangeman George Duddy for the second time in two months.
The threat was sprayed on the wall outside his house on Drumaquill Road, Coleraine, County Londonderry.
Police have said it happened between 22:20 BST and 22:40 BST on Thursday and they are treating it as a hate crime.
Last month, threatening graffiti was sprayed on the same wall and Mr Duddy's union flag was stolen from his garden.
He holds the title of Coleraine District Master in the Orange Order and is also a member of the town council.
At the time of the previous attack on 11 August, police said they were treating it as a hate crime and the Orange Order said Mr Duddy was the fourth senior Orangemen whose home had been attacked over a three-week period in the area.
Speaking after the latest incident, the councillor said he viewed it as a ""very serious and sinister threat"".
However, he said he would not be intimidated out of his home by whoever was behind the attacks.
Mr Duddy added that he was committed to serving his constituents as a DUP councillor and was proud of his culture and role in the Orange Order.
Police visited the councillor's house on Thursday night to record the incident. They have appealed for anyone with information about the attacks to contact them.",Yes
4,5,targeted threat,"Lockdown bomb hoaxer targeted NHS, MPs and BLM protests",26 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56204359,"An Italian man in Germany has been sentenced to three years in prison for threatening to bomb NHS hospitals, Black Lives Matter rallies and UK MPs.
Emil Apreda, 33, sent emails from Berlin demanding Â£10m worth of Bitcoin to not carry out the attacks.
The National Crime Agency said he made his threats in the spring and summer of 2020 as the NHS struggled with Covid.
Senior officers kept the threats from the public for fear of patients being scared into not attending hospitals.
Apreda used encryption techniques and the dark web in an attempt to hide his identity, but police brought in behavioural, linguistics and cyber-crime experts to track him down.
He sent emails to the NHS pretending to be a far-right activist linked to the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, but police believe that was just a ruse to instil fear.
He was finally identified by German detectives and armed officers raided his home in Berlin on 15 June last year.
For the first time, the NCA has revealed details of the case, calling it ""one of the most significant threats we've seen for some time"" which took place at a time of ""deep and heightened anxiety"" in the UK.
Tim Court, the NCA's head of investigations, said the content of the emails was ""so threatening and so damaging"" that it was only disclosed to a ""very tight circle of people - and I mean very tight"" within the police and government.
Meanwhile, security at hospitals was quietly stepped up.
Mr Court said the risks were both of loss of life and a loss of confidence in the NHS.
""At the height of this, we were losing nearly nearly 1,000 people a day - and for six weeks we're trying to manage somebody who could have been planting a bomb in a hospital, somewhere in the UK.""
A particular concern was that many patients were on ventilators or oxygen at the time, and it would have been more difficult to get them out of a hospital in the event of a credible bomb threat.
The extortion campaign started on 26 April when Apreda sent an email to the NHS, making his demand for Bitcoin and warning that he would send a bomb in a package to a hospital in the UK if he was not paid.
This was followed by an identical email to an NCA control centre, followed by 16 more over six weeks.
During that period, the death of George Floyd in the US and resulting protests in the UK prompted threats from him to blow up Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
Finally, as the fourth anniversary of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right activist approached, he emailed that he would kill MPs - but did not name any.
Police behavioural and linguistics experts drew up a profile of the extortionist, who they decided was not from the UK.
Police say further ""technical leads"" pointed to Germany. He was finally identified by LKA, the German CID.
Apreda had been issuing deadlines for payment after which he said he would attack, so the day before the anniversary of Ms Cox's death, German police moved in, blowing open the front door of his Berlin flat and arresting him.
Police say he has background in computing, but they have discovered no links to Combat 18, despite his claims.
The far-right group has been active in the UK in the past, but now exists mainly in the US and Germany.
Apreda was charged and convicted of extortion in Germany, but the NCA said he could have faced terrorism charges if he had been brought to the UK.
The NCA  said he had no links that they could find with Britain, and therefore extraditing him had not been possible. It denied Brexit had been a major factor.",Yes
5,6,targeted threat,Bristol theatre archive grant to save 'at risk' records,23 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-56490268,"The University of Bristol's theatre archive is to receive a government grant to stop valuable records being lost forever.
The Theatre Collection - one of the world's leading archives of British theatre - will get Â£25,179 from The National Archives.
It will help identify items in the UK at risk, and ensure they are preserved.
With the performing arts sector under pressure due to Covid, important records are said to be ""in jeopardy"".
Professor Karla Pollman, dean of the faculty of arts at the University of Bristol, said she was grateful to The National Archives for awarding a grant in response to the ""urgent situation"".
The money will help safeguard digital as well as analogue material from photographers, designers, actors and writers that is deemed in ""immediate danger"".
She added: ""The project has the potential to make a material contribution to the history of theatre and live art in Britain which might otherwise disappear.""
The collection documents life on and off-stage and hopes to safeguard or re-home other vulnerable collections from the community.
The grant of Â£25,179 will allow archivists to target collections under threat across the spectrum of British performance practice - from companies, individuals, and backstage professionals - so that they can be safely stored and recorded.
A total of 25 archives from across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have each received up to Â£50,000 from the fund.
The government grants will offset some of the practical costs of keeping archives, such as storage, conservation, transport and expertise.
Jeff James, chief executive and keeper at The National Archives, said: ""We cannot underestimate the importance of this funding and the support it gives to the successful archives.
""Records which were under threat will now be saved and preserved allowing future generations to research and learn from them.""",Yes
6,7,targeted threat,Polish election: Leader targets gay rights as threat to society,8 October 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49904849,"""We consider two communities fundamental, the family as one man, one woman and the children,"" said the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) at a recent convention.
LGBT+ rights have become the single biggest cultural issue in Poland's election campaign ahead of Sunday's vote. In the eyes of Jaroslaw Kaczynski's national-conservative party and the Catholic Church, those rights are a threat to traditional Polish families and values.
Mr Kaczynski likes to identify threats to Polish society - during the election campaign four years ago, he said Middle Eastern migrants might bring ""parasites and protozoa"" to Poland.
This time around, according to Mr Kaczynski, the threat comes from LGBT+ people and from Europe, where families can have ""two mummies or two daddies"", he said.
Poland's 1997 constitution states that a marriage is between a man and a woman. Civil partnerships, be they between heterosexual or same-sex couples, are not legally recognised.
""Christianity is part of our national identity, the [Catholic] Church was and is the preacher and holder of the only commonly held system of values in Poland,"" he said. ""Outside of itâ¦ we have only nihilism.""
Senior Catholic Church figures have gone further, most notably the Archbishop of Krakow, Marek Jedraszewski, who on numerous occasions has identified the ""LGBT lobby"" and ""gender ideology"" as the new threat to Polish freedom following the end of communism in 1989, calling it ""totalitarian"" and a ""great threat to our freedom"".
In the beautiful, medieval city of Torun, birthplace of the astronomer Copernicus, chef Mariusz Godlejewski rejected the notion that he was a threat. During more than a decade living in Ireland, Mariusz married his long-term partner Bartosz before the couple returned to their homeland last year.
""My husband and I have been together for 14 years. Who are we, two strangers living together? We are family as well,"" he said. ""Coming back here I knew what I was getting in to. I knew that I will lose all the rights with my husband we gained in Ireland but we wanted to come and help our friends to make the change.""
Mariusz believes it is only a matter of time before things do change but finds the tone of political debate depressing.
Last month, a professor from Torun's Copernicus University, Aleksander Nalaskowski, was suspended after he likened homosexuality to ""the plague"" and complained that gay men and women were demanding not only tolerance, but acceptance.
Government-supporting circles argued his suspension was an abuse of free speech and he was subsequently reinstated.
Mariusz was organising the third equality march in Torun, in which more than a thousand people walked through the city guarded on both sides by helmeted riot police carrying shields.
A police water cannon I saw parked in the road was not required but violence has broken out during equality marches in the cities of Bialystok, where gangs of angry young men attacked parade participants, and in Lublin, where counter demonstrators clashed with police and two protesters were arrested after they reportedly brought homemade explosive devices.
Poland remains more socially conservative than many countries in Western Europe but attitudes to LGBT+ issues are changing.
There are more and more equality marches, 32 this year compared to 13 last year. Most, like the one in Torun, are joyful, peaceful events.
Underneath a statue of Copernicus in the city centre, a small counter demonstration gathered before the equality march. There were several members of the far-right National Radical Camp, holding their green and white flags emblazoned with a falanga sword, which is associated with fascism.
There were also banners warning about how the ""LGBT lobby"" wants to teach pre-schoolers how to masturbate, above the slogan ""Stop paedophilia"".
There was also a photo of an equality parade showing two male marchers holding a rainbow flag from behind, their bare buttocks pixellated. Some people held crosses and handed out white, plastic rosary beads before prayers were said for the souls of the equality march participants.
""Everyone has the same rights. For example, they have the same right to marry. I can marry my girlfriend, they can also marry their girlfriends, but they want to marry the same sex,"" organiser and teacher Radoslaw Duch said.
""We don't want to arrest them, we don't want to get rid of them. They have to be aware they are sinners. Me as a Catholic person, I want to show them a better path of their life,"" he added.
If opinion polls are correct, PiS should win the October 13 election comfortably.
Attitudes in Poland may be changing, but if Mr Kaczynski's party does win a second term, there seems little chance that homosexual couples will enjoy the same rights as their heterosexual neighbours any time soon.",Yes
7,8,targeted threat,Shoot for the Moon: The big space missions in 2021,26 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/55453308,"The last year has been pretty significant when it comes to big space milestones.
History was made with the Curiosity rover sending back amazing pictures of Mars' surface, Nasa astronauts being sent to space on a rocket owned by the private company SpaceX, and the European Space Agency turning 45.
And Nasa has announced a packed schedule of space missions for 2021 - so there's a lot to be excited about.
Here's what's coming up...
SpaceX: Spacecraft takes four astronauts to ISS
How Moon ice could fuel Japan's spaceships
European Space Agency turns 45!
Spacecraft from three Mars exploration programmes - Mars 2020, Tianwen-1, and Hope - are all expected to enter the planet's orbit in February.
The United Arab Emirates expect their Hope orbiter to arrive by 9 February. Nasa's Perseverance rover will attempt landing on 18 February, while the Chinese lander should arrive on 23 April.
But Nasa's mission isn't just about launching the Perseverance to collect rock samples. During the mission, Nasa will deploy the Ingenuity helicopter from the rover in the first demonstration of rotorcraft on another planet.
It also plans to attempt to produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, something that will be critical for future human exploration of the Red Planet.
In July, Nasa will launch the first test for its new planetary defence project. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, which is about the size of a small car, will deliberately crash into an asteroid moon in Autumn 2022 to change its motion.
Thankfully it's just a test, as the asteroid Didymos, nor its targeted moon Dimorphos, pose any threat to our planet.
Meanwhile Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope - a large space telescope optimised for infrared wavelengths which has suffered a number of delays to its mission into orbit - is finally scheduled for launch in October.
It's hoped it will find the first galaxies that formed in the early universe and peer through dusty clouds to see stars forming planetary systems.
Last year Nasa revealed its plans to send astronauts back to the Moon by 2024, but there are a lot of major steps needed to make this happen.
This mission, called Artemis 1, will aim to launch the new SLS rocket this year sending the Orion spacecraft on a loop around the Moon without a pilot.
Artemis 1 is planned to fly in November, the first flight of the Space Launch System, although there have been some set backs due to rocket delays and the coronavirus pandemic, so watch this space!
The first lunar mission for Orion, a month-long mission around the Moon, is due to happen by Autumn.
Its aim is to lay the foundations for human lunar exploration and enable us to 'explore like never before'.
Elsewhere the Space Agency aims to send up a new Earth-observing satellite - Landsat 9, the latest satellite in the Landsat series - to continue to measure and keep track of changes on the global land surface, like tropical deforestation and melting glaciers.
Russia plans to launch its Luna-25 interplanetary station in October 2021, with the creation of the device and all tests planned will be completed in summer of 2021.
India's third lunar exploration mission Chandrayaan-3 could launch in late 2021.
Lucy, a Nasa space probe will launch in 2021 and begin a 12-year journey to seven different asteroids, visiting six Jupiter trojans, and one Main Belt asteroid.
Trojans are asteroids which share Jupiter's orbit around the Sun, orbiting either ahead of or behind the planet.
Russian State Space Corporation Roscosmos says it plans to begin offering space tours this year, launching two tourists into orbit.
It's signed a deal with US space tourism company called Space Adventures, to fly the passengers to the International Space Station (ISS).
The mission will be the first tourist flight to the station in 12 years, following the 2009 flight of Canadian billionaire  Guy Laliberte.",Yes
8,9,targeted threat,"Deeside: Liverpool-based gang used lie detectors, threats and drug 'hotline'",11 September 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-54079378,"Eighteen people have been jailed for their part in a gang that flooded north Wales with drugs.
They were arrested in September 2019 as part of the largest operation of its type ever carried out by North Wales Police.
A judge at Mold Crown Court described it as a ""sophisticated operation"", involving encrypted mobile phones, lie detectors and even a plot to attack a former gang member who had fallen out of favour.
Police seized drugs with a street value of Â£2.1m.
The reach of the gang, based in Liverpool, stretched to Aberdeen and Cornwall.
It was an operation described as a classic example of a ""county lines"" conspiracy.
The group behind the supply, led by Colin Jones, were violent and were specifically targeted by police due to the threat posed to public safety.
Officers had spent nearly three years investigating the gang, right to the very top.
Colin Jones, based in Walton in Liverpool, was described as a drugs wholesaler who rarely got his hands dirty.
When he was arrested, police found he had nine phones, and two encrypted devices. He hired lie detector specialists to check out his colleagues.
As well as selling drugs, he swapped them for sports cars.
Colin Jones had a team of call handlers who answered what the gang called ""the Echo Line"".
In a three-month period in 2018, the hotline took over 100,000 calls. Police estimated it was selling several thousand pounds of drugs a day.
Drugs were also sent up and down the UK, sometimes in packages sent from local post offices in Liverpool.
At one point the violence was turned on one of their former conspirators. Colin Jones and David Rawling were secretly recorded talking to an unknown hit man arranging an attack on Lee Murray.
Officers stepped in and stopped the attack, but believed a gun would have been involved.
Judge Niclas Parry spent three days sentencing the gang. He said they had controlled a significant portion of the drugs trade in Deeside, casting a blight on the community.
Colin Jones was sentenced to 21 years in total with the other gang members given sentences from four to 15 and a half years.
Police say it is a significant victory against the supply of drugs from big cities into north Wales - but it remains a fight that will continue in the months to come.",Yes

10,11,targeted threat,Russian cities targeted by mystery bomb threats,13 September 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41251684,"For four days running, towns and cities across Russia have been hit by a wave of bomb alerts.
Dozens of schools, shopping centres, railway stations and public buildings have been evacuated. Tens of thousands of people have been affected.
So far, all of the alerts have proved to be hoaxes and the public has been urged to remain calm.
The source of the threats is unclear but one official suggested they had originated outside Russia.
""There's reason to assume this was all organised abroad,"" the official in Chelyabinsk told Interfax news agency.
On Wednesday, the bomb scares spread to Moscow, prompting the evacuation of the luxury GUM shopping centre near the Kremlin. In the capital alone, more than 50,000 people were caught up in the alerts, reports said.
Pro-Kremlin newspapers have pointed to a ""major hacking attack"", possibly from Ukraine. State TV said 205 companies and organisations had been targeted nationally.
Other reports suggested the threats were made via scrambled internet connections and were difficult to source. One official was quoted as saying the evacuations were part of an anti-terrorist drill but that has not been confirmed.
The hoax calls began on Sunday but the extent of the alerts only became clear by Tuesday:
They continued to spread on Wednesday, with airports also targeted:
No-one is certain but the alerts appear to have come in the form of a pre-recorded voice message via internet telephony. One message received in the city of Ufa was broadcast on national TV.
""An explosive device has been placed in the building. Evacuate the people, call the bomb squads. This is not a drill. Do you understand me?""
A security source told pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda that the hoaxes were the result of a cyber attack organised from Ukraine, although no evidence was given. An IT security specialist quoted elsewhere spoke only of a foreign hacking attack.
The governor of Stavropol called it a ""phone attack"" that had come from abroad and one phone company spoke of an ""international virtual operator"".
Russian military exercise raises tension
There was some suggestion, too, that the source of the disruption may have been closer to home. An aide to the Russian defence ministry's inspector general was quoted as saying it was part of an anti-terror exercise.
""For the first time since Soviet times, large-scale anti-terrorism exercises are being carried out in Russia, involving all government agencies responsible for state security,"" Oleg Ostrovsky told newspaper Argumenty i Fakty Prikamye. The report was later deleted, according to BBC Monitoring.
Russia has been hit by jihadist attacks, including a bombing on the St Petersburg metro in April in which 16 people died.
However, a former opposition MP, Gennady Gudkov, warned that if the current alerts really were the work of federal security officers, then ""that is completely crap"".
Russia's military is due to start joint military exercises on Thursday with Belarus. The exercises, called Zapad-2017 (West-2017) will involve a reported 12,700 soldiers in Belarus and Kaliningrad. Some figures outside Russia have predicted many more soldiers may be involved.",Yes

14,15,targeted threat,Scientists target threat of MRSA,10 May 2006,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4758021.stm,"Powerful strains of MRSA are beginning to break out of hospitals into the community.

With the superbug also becoming more resistant to antibiotics, researchers are in a race for new ways to counter it. 

Microbe USA300 has already swept through more than 25 different states in the USA, infecting children, college students, and even athletes.

One incident involved several members of the St Louis' Ram's Football team.


The infection is easily spread, highly resistant to drugs and much more virulent than ordinary MRSA as it can cause the victim to suffer a nasty flesh-eating condition called necrotizing fasciitis.

According to the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA300 is fast becoming the dominant form of MRSA in the community.

""USA 300 is unique because it is capable of acquiring multi-drug resistance"" said Dr Binh Diep, part of a team at the University of California at San Francisco, who sequenced the genome of USA300 earlier this year.

""This particular clone that we sequenced carried resistance to four different classes of antibiotic."" 

Flexible strategy

Dr Diep's team think they have discovered how this particular strain or clone of MRSA has become so adept at resisting antibiotics.









The real doomsday scenario now is that you have an increasing number of young fit people with Community MRSA, you have a flu epidemic that makes the lungs more susceptible to infection and then the MRSA will actually kill people very quickly
 


Professor Richard James






Its DNA contains what Dr Diep calls ""a mobile genetic element"" - a part of its genome whose job it is to acquire DNA from other microbes including those that already live benignly on human skin.

It is hoped that working back through the genetic changes which have turned ordinary MRSA into USA300 might yield a treatment in the future.

But what do we do in the meantime?

In his microbiology lab at Nottingham University,  Dr Paul Williams talks casually about experimenting on his favourite microbes - plague, dysentery, E. coli and MRSA to name a few.

""The kind of work we do here in Nottingham is to try to turn a nasty pathogenic bug into a nice happy microbe who doesn't cause any harm."" 

The secret, explains Dr Williams is to unlock the mysterious process known as quorum sensing.

It was a term coined about 15 years ago in Nottingham by a late colleague of Dr Williams, and refers to the way bacterium, once thought of as individuals rather than a community of organisms, can communicate with one another and make a decision.

""As the bacteria begin to grow they produce low levels of a signal molecule.

""As that concentration of the molecule accumulates, it allows more and more cells to sense there are more bacteria present.

""When that reaches a critical threshold concentration then bang! The bacteria say: 'OK there is a enough of us here, we can really make a difference and cause some trouble'.""

Boardroom analogy

This phenomenon has been called 'quorum sensing' with the idea very much in the context of a board of directors where the company have to make a decision and can only do it when the board is quorate - when there are enough of them there to make that decision binding.









The important thing is we're not trying to kill the micro-organism, we're trying to reform it
 


Dr Paul Williams






Dr Williams said: ""It is the same in the bacterial world - you need enough cells there to make a decision that is binding.""

The idea is to interfere with this communication process, prevent a decision and turn a nasty pathogen into a friendly well-behaved microbe that doesn't cause disease.

""We can either destroy the signal molecule or the receptor that senses the presence of signal molecule - then we have a new set of [treatment] targets but the important thing is we're not trying to kill the micro-organism, we're trying to reform it - turning off that bad behaviour, a little bit like a bacterial ASBO."" 

Once an obscure corridor of microbiology, quorum sensing is now centre stage with research teams across both Europe and the US. 

But researchers hoping to exploit the secrets of bacterial communication say it could take a decade.

Immediate threat

The threat of MRSA in the community is more immediate.

Right now, the Health Protection Agency aren't overly concerned.

Last year there were only about 100 official cases of community MRSA registered in the UK with the HPA.

But the most worrying scenario according to Professor Richard James, also at Nottingham's Centre for Biomolecular Sciences is an outbreak of Community MRSA off the back of a flu epidemic. 

Already about 30% to 40% of the general population carry the MRSA bug in their noses, without any ill effects. 

It is only when there is a vulnerability - a wound, a graze - some way for the microbe to get into the body, that there is a risk of infection. 

Recent research from US investigators in Baltimore, has concluded that there is a strong link between influenza and the risk of falling victim to the most severe form of MRSA.

Professor James said: ""The real doomsday scenario now is that you have an increasing number of young fit people with Community MRSA, you have a flu epidemic that makes the lungs more susceptible to infection and then the MRSA will actually kill people very quickly.""

16,17,targeted threat,MI6 'may be committing crimes in UK',16 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55340234,"MI6 agents and informants may be committing crimes in the UK, a watchdog has revealed.
The Investigatory Powers Tribunal disclosed the ruling despite government attempts to keep the matter secret.
It also said questions raised should be disclosed to campaigners, who have been asking for greater legal clarity over what the intelligence agencies can do.
It comes a day after the intelligence services watchdog raised its own questions about some MI6 activities.
Since 1994, MI6 - the UK's foreign intelligence service - has been able to authorise people that it recruits to help the UK overseas to commit crimes as part of its targeting of threats to the UK.
That power has long-been dubbed the ""James Bond clause"" - but it does not explicitly permit criminal operations in the UK.
Unprecedented legislation that clarifies how agencies recruiting undercover informants can authorise them to commit crimes is reaching its final stages in Parliament.
The disclosure of crimes potentially committed by people supplying MI6 with intelligence has come amid a long-running court battle over whether such secret undercover activity can ever be legal.
While the legal battle has revealed details of how MI5, the domestic security service, authorises crimes by its informants, Wednesday's disclosure by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) is the first indication that MI6 may be doing the same.
In the ruling, the IPT rejected secret submissions from the government to keep the entire matter behind closed doors.
The disclosure came the day after the annual report of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, the watchdog that oversees the secret agencies, revealed that one of MI6's agents overseas may have gone rogue and committed serious crimes.
The report says that in 2019 the secret agency had recruited a potential agent overseas and had sought a standard authorisation from the foreign secretary for the individual to potentially commit crimes as part of their work for the UK.
The report does not state which foreign secretary it was.
""The Secret Intelligence Service [MI6] identified a risk that the agent may be involved in serious criminality overseas,"" said the report. ""SIS did not encourage, condone or approve any such criminality on the part of their agent.
""In their submission, SIS set out that they had secured the agent's cooperation on terms of full transparency about the activities in which the agent was involved.
""It included some clear 'red lines', setting out conduct that was not authorised and would result in the termination of SIS's relationship with the agent.""
Six months later, when the authorisation had to be reviewed, it appeared that MI6 had concluded the asset had probably crossed those red lines - but they did not tell the foreign secretary, who had to sign off the continuing operation.
""We concluded that the renewal did not provide a comprehensive overview of available information which we believe would have provided the Secretary of State with a fuller and more balanced picture,"" said the watchdog. ""SIS immediately responded to these concerns by updating the FCO.""
Campaigners behind the legal action say both revelations prove the public are being kept in the dark.
But ministers say legislation going through Parliament will provide clear safeguards for agents to commit crimes while undercover.",Yes

20,21,targeted threat,Affordable homes 2020 target date 'under threat',11 July 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23255326,"The Scottish government's vision of providing affordable homes for all could miss its 2020 target date by several years, according to a report.
The recession has seen a massive reduction in public and private funding for house building, Audit Scotland said.
Supply of new properties is failing to keep up with demand.
And it could be 20 years before enough new homes are being built to meet the projected increase in households.
The spending watchdog said that, as the population continued to grow, the 2020 vision was ""ambitious"" and the government needed to clarify how it would work with councils and other partners in the sector to meet its targets.
The Housing in Scotland report was produced for the Auditor General and the Accounts Commission.
Caroline Gardner, Auditor General for Scotland, said: ""Housing is a significant national asset and the sector in Scotland is under increasing pressure. Budgets are tightening, while demand is increasing and fewer houses are being built.""
The report revealed that private sector house building has more than halved in recent years.
And since 2005 local authorities and Registered Social Landlords (RSL), who are key to providing low rent homes, have built 14,000 fewer homes than research suggested were needed.
Changes to the benefit system, an ageing population and the increasing number of single person households were creating further pressures on the sector.
The report notes Scottish government funding for housing fell by around a quarter between 2008-09 and 2011-12 with further reductions to come.
John Baillie, chair of the Accounts Commission, said: ""Good housing is important for individuals and families but also for wider society.  It can support economic growth, promote strong, resilient communities and improve health.
""Links between housing and other policy areas at both national and local level should be stronger, to help improve the impact that good housing can make to our communities.""
Responding to the report, a Scottish government spokesman said it had taken ""decisive action"" to improve housing in Scotland.
He added: ""We are investing nearly Â£900m over three years as part of our target of building 30,000 new, affordable homes over the lifetime of this parliament.
""As this report recognises, we are having to deal with Westminster's cuts to our capital budgets, a difficult lending environment, and the UK government's welfare reform agenda - all of which add to the pressures that we face in delivering new affordable homes.
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations welcomed the emphasis placed by Audit Scotland on the provision of affordable public sector housing.
Policy manager Susan Torrance said: ""We are particularly pleased to see encouragement to improve transparency in the reporting of budgets and supply targets.
""The challenges made by Audit Scotland to strengthen national and local housing strategies to improve supply and construction of homes to meet housing need are important.""
Gordon MacRae, head of policy at housing charity Shelter Scotland, said: ""The report clearly shows that action is required now to meet the challenge of a collapse in availability of new homes and the spiralling demands of Scotland's ageing and increasingly single households.
""To end Scotland's housing crisis for good, Scotland needs a clear housing strategy aimed at creating good quality homes for the country's 157,000 households stuck on council waiting lists.""",Yes
21,22,targeted threat,Bristol's artists get racist abuse for 'joyful' project,31 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-53607434,"Black artists have been targeted with threats of violence and racist abuse following a campaign for social change.
The women took part in the Rising Arts Agency's #WhoseFuture campaign where 370 billboards in Bristol were posted with art, photography and poetry.
In a statement, the agency said a minority of people had targeted six artists as well as the agency.
Avon and Somerset Police has confirmed it is investigating the reports made on social media to several individuals.
The campaign was launched in mid-July as a response to the worldwide Black Lives Matter movement.
Founder, Kamina Walton, said the majority of abuse was aimed at one young, black female artist.
The agency has not named her in order to protect her.
""She is a mixture of extremely angry, upset and traumatised.
""We knew there was potential for backlash but we had no idea it would be to the point where people's lives are being threatened,"" added Ms Walton.
The agency also said it has received public support and its aim was to give a voice, not just to people of colour, but those who felt ostracised and excluded from the arts sector.
""This campaign was about asking questions of the city but it was also saying, 'look at this talent that is on your doorstep that you're just not seeing'.
""That is what has been so joyful about the campaign. For those artists, their self-esteem was through the roof and and it felt like a real celebration,"" said Ms Walton.

24,25,targeted threat,"Newspaper headlines: ""Scrapped migration targets"" and jihadist attack threat",24 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-30172486,"Immigration has become one of the biggest issues in British politics in recent years, and a story about migrant numbers again features heavily in the papers.
The Daily Telegraph leads with Theresa May's admission that the government had been ""blown off course"" in its attempts to curb immigration to the UK, and was ""unlikely"" to reduce net migration figures to the under-100,000-a-year target it had set itself.
The home secretary gave an interview to the paper confirming that the coalition was shelving its pledge to achieve the reduction by 2015.
It was a pledge David Cameron had said was a ""no ifs, no buts"" promise, the Telegraph notes.
Mrs May's assertion that the rising migration figures were partly as a result of the British economy's strength compared to EU rivals cuts no ice with her Labour counterpart, the paper adds.
""Continually making and breaking grand promises on immigration is only undermining confidence in the entire system,"" Labour's Yvette Cooper says.
The Daily Mail says the abandoning of the pledge has triggered a ""furious political row"".
It says recent figures show net migration is currently running at 240,000 a year.
The Daily Express highlights former Conservative minister Peter Lilley's comments that: ""Most people believe Britain is full - and they are right. We are already a nation of more than 60 million. We cannot take any more and have to shut the door.""
The Daily Mirror focuses on Ed Miliband's vow to ""shut rogue job agencies that undercut wages and exploit workers.""
""He will stop big firms using rogue agencies to hire staff on the cheap,"" the paper says, ""and ban job Â­agencies recruiting only from abroad.""
It's a theme taken up by the Guardian's editorial which says agency working and zero-hours contracts have driven down pay levels to a level that encourages migration from low-wage economies.
""Tackling Britain's hyper-flexible under-regulated labour market should be a priority,"" it adds.
The Daily Telegraph has a feature by Mats Persson of the think tank Open Europe.
Mr Persson, whose ideas the prime minister is said to be considering, argues that in-work benefits - such as tax credits, social housing and access to the NHS - should not be ""immediately available"" to new arrivals from other EU countries.
These benefits are a ""taxpayer-backed-subsidy"" enabling migrants from low cost countries to work at jobs most British workers would say they couldn't afford to take.
Mr Persson illustrates his point by arguing that a typical Polish migrant can up his or her take-home pay by 95% by coming to Britain and claiming working benefits, but if those benefits were withdrawn, the same Pole would be earning 27% less than if he or she had stayed in his or her native country.
The Express notes that former chancellor Kenneth Clarke has called the idea ""discriminatory"".
Mrs May's pronouncements were not just on migration, but addressed the threat the UK faced from potential terrorism by jihadists.
The Daily Mail puts a comment from a Whitehall official that an attack is ""almost inevitable"", on its front page.
Mrs May is to outline new anti-terror powers, the paper adds, including forcibly relocating terror suspects and barring Britons returning from Syria from entering the UK for two years.
In her interview in the Daily Telegraph, the home secretary says, ""Britain is facing the greatest terror threat of its history.""
The idea that Britain faces a worse threat than during the IRA's bombing campaign is a ""disquieting backdrop"", the paper's leader column says.
The Guardian focuses on another announcement Mrs May is expected to make: that insurance companies will be banned from reimbursing ransom payments.
The measure is designed to ""cut funding to barbaric terror groups"", the paper explains.
In another story, the Guardian casts doubt on whether the US airstrikes in Syria are undermining support for Islamic State (IS) jihadists.
The paper carries a series of interviews with Syrian opposition fighters who say support for IS is growing because of the bombing, both from civilians and armed insurgents.
""All the locals here wonder why the US coalition never came to rescue them from Assad's machine guns, but run to fight Isis when it took a few pieces of land,"" says one Free Syrian Army commander.
The Daily Star says that SAS ""hit squads"" are killing hundreds of IS jihadists in ""a series of daring raids"".
The elite soldiers are using quad bikes to cross desert terrain and then attack the militants with sniper fire and heavy machine guns, it says.
""Our tactics are putting the fear of God into IS as they don't know where we're going to strike next and there's frankly nothing they can do to stop us,"" the paper's ""SAS source"" tells it.
The Times is one of many papers to features two former British soldiers who have joined Syrian Kurds to fight IS.
The pair deny being mercenaries, but say they were motivated to stop the slaughter of civilians in a war of ""good versus evil"".
The paper notes British police are investigating reports that a 17-year-old girl from London may also be trying to join Kurdish forces.
""The young are the new poor"" reads the Independent's stark headline.
It refers to a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which says that ""the rise of part-time work and low-paid self-employment has been accompanied by a sharp increase in the number of under-25s living below the breadline"".
The Foundation says as many working families as unemployed ones now live in its definition of poverty, and young people are more likely to be poor than pensioners are.
""Pensioners have benefited from targeted policies, seeing a sharp fall in poverty to a record low level: from once being the most likely to be poor, the over-65s now have the lowest poverty rate of any age group,"" the paper says.
The paper continues that the study suggests: ""That while employment was close to a historic high, millions of Britons were struggling to cope with a reality of insecure work and incomes which have fallen on average by 9% in the five years to 2013.""
It carries a case study of a 22-year-old from Sheffield who has a masters degree in clinical neurology, but was unable to find work in the field despite 174 interviews and now works as a cleaner.
Rebecca Field tells the Independent that she still relies on her parents to top up her earnings, and may be forced to move back in with them.
""There is a real lack of jobs. It's not just the graduates from this year competing for jobs, it's the graduates from last year,"" she tells the paper.
In its editorial, the paper says that the problem is not ""selfish oldies"" but poorly paid and insecure work, coupled with a lack of affordable accommodation.
""One alarming fact in the report is that most self-employed people earn markedly less now than they did five years ago.
""This should disturb everyone, because the rapid rise in self-employment is constantly extolled as a good thing - the welcome liberation of the workforce from the old tyranny of office and factory life.
""Now we can see that this new freedom is often a ticket to a lifetime of insecurity,"" the editorial says.
One man's image dominates Monday's front pages.
With his diamond earrings, glamorous pop star girlfriend and, now, second Formula One world championship, it's unsurprising that Lewis Hamilton sports the widest grin humanly possible.
""I Ham the Greatest"", is the Daily Star's slightly tortuous headline, the paper noting that the ""normally ice cool racing driver wept inside his visor"" as he embraced his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.
The Daily Mail has a quote box featuring Prince Harry's words to the British champion after the race.
""Lewis, thank you very, very much for not making the British public sweat. You are an absolute legend. well done, mate,"" the Prince said.
A rather overwhelmed Hamilton replied: ""Woohooo! World Champion. Oh my God. I can't believe it. Thank you so much guys.""
The Sun notes his win puts Hamilton in the Â£100m earning bracket.
""The F1 ace and his girlfriend... are primed to be the next celebrity super-couple,"" it adds.
The Daily Mirror, with the editorial, ""Lew beauty"", makes a plea for the ""speedster"" to return to the UK from Monaco to ""make a greater contribution to British society"".
Sports writer Kevin Garside in a comment piece in the Independent waxes lyrical on the way Hamilton bested his only realistic rival for the crown this year, his team-mate Nico Rosberg.
""If you are going to make a statement, make it a big one.
""Hamilton rammed syllable by syllable the speculative pre-race pap about the pressure getting to him down the exhaust pipes of Rosberg. Pressure would play a part, Rosberg was right about that. He simply identified the wrong victim.
""Hamilton handed down a textbook lesson in how to cope when the heat turns molten, delivering what he described as the best start of his career precisely at the point he needed it most, blazing off the grid 'like a rocket' to beat Rosberg into the first corner.""
Although he didn't know it, it was all over by then.

High sanitation levels have an important role in saving people's lives across the world.

And they're calling for help from governments to reach their goal.

26,27,targeted threat,France terror attacks: Macron calls for EU free movement reform,5 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54829214,"France has stepped up security at its borders and is calling for a rethink on free movement in the EU after a spate of suspected Islamist terror attacks.
President Emmanuel Macron said the EU's Schengen area, which allows people to cross borders freely, may need reform.
A knife attack in Nice last week, which killed three people, was blamed on a Tunisian migrant who crossed into France from Italy in October.
It was the second alleged jihadist attack in France in just over a month.
France's security alert is at its highest level, with thousands of soldiers deployed to protect places of worship and schools, since teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded for showing cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad to his students.
President Macron has since sparked anger and protests in some Muslim-majority countries with his robust defence of France's values and freedoms that permitted the publication of cartoons.
But he has rejected right-wing calls for greater safeguards to protect the country's principle of secularism, saying: ""The situation does not warrant changing the constitution.""
And, in a letter to the Financial Times, he made clear France was fighting ""Islamist separatism, never Islam"". He accused the British newspaper of misquoting him in an article - which has since been removed from its website - suggesting he was ""stigmatising French Muslims for electoral purposes"".
""I will not allow anybody to claim that France, or its government, is fostering racism against Muslims,"" he said in the letter to the editor.
Speaking during a visit to the French-Spanish border, Mr Macron said he would be doubling police border patrol numbers from 2,400 to 4,800 ""because of the worsening of the threat"" of terrorism.
He also said he would be unveiling proposals for strengthening border security within the EU at the next EU summit in December, which would include ""intensifying our common border protection with a real security force at the external borders"".
Under the Schengen agreement, people within the EU are able to pass freely across borders without showing their passport. However, border checks have made a return in recent months because of the coronavirus pandemic.
An elderly woman was beheaded and two other people were killed in a church in Nice on 29 October. Witnesses said they heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest).
The suspect, who was shot and detained by police, was identified as Brahim Aioussaoi - a 21-year-old Tunisian man who had travelled to the Italian island of Lampedusa in September and crossed into France a few days before the attack.
Earlier in October, Samuel Paty, a teacher in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, north-west of Paris, was attacked and beheaded in the street by an 18-year-old Chechen Muslim. He had been the target of threats for days after showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to pupils as part of a civics lesson.
Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are offensive to Muslims.
The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
A trial is currently under way over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 following their publication.
France's Muslim community, which is Europe's largest, comprises about 10% of the population.
Some French Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country.",Yes
27,28,targeted threat,Emma Watson targeted by online trolls after UN speech,23 September 2014,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-29322764,"Internet trolls appear to have made a threat to Emma Watson.
A web page titled Emma You Are Next, featuring an image of the Harry Potter star next to a countdown, suggests the actress will be targeted.
UPDATE: How the threat was a hoax and who was behind it
The page also features the logo of 4chan, the site which is said to have hosted two recent leaks of naked celebrity photos.
Jennifer Lawrence and Kim Kardashian are among those to be targeted.
The threat was launched hours after Watson, 24, launched the HeForShe campaign in a speech at the UN in which she appealed to men to speak out over gender equality.
""I was appointed six months ago and the more I have spoken about feminism the more I have realised that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating,"" she said.
""If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop.""
Watson's first appearance as Hermione Granger was in 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as an 11-year-old.
She told UN delegates in New York that she started thinking about gender inequality as a child three years before hitting the big time.
UN Women, a United Nations group looking at gender equality, also suggested that the global film industry doesn't do enough to represent women in films.
It said there had not been enough speaking roles for women, sexualisation is common and women have been under-represented in action and adventure movies.
It found 23% of speaking characters in that genre were female.
The study looked at films made in 11 countries, including South Korea, the US and India.
The UK was singled out for doing a better job than some other countries by creating more speaking roles for women.

28,29,targeted threat,New York Mayor Bill de Blasio targets income gap 'threat',10 February 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-26123503,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged to raise the minimum wage and issue ID papers to undocumented immigrants.
Setting out the policies of his new administration in a State of the City address, Mr de Blasio took aim at the city's yawning inequality gap.
The 52-year-old also wants to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund universal pre-kindergarten programmes.
Elected in November, he is New York's first Democratic mayor in two decades.
In Monday's speech, Mr de Blasio said: ""We understand that allowing the income gap to stretch further isn't simply a threat to those at the bottom but to every New Yorker.""
The married father of two chose a Queens community college to make one of the most important speeches of his young administration.
It was a relatively low-key venue compared with the stylish new Brooklyn Nets arena where his three-term predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, gave his last State of the City address.
""We want to ensure that New Yorkers aren't relegated to the ranks of the poor when putting in a full week's work,"" Mr de Blasio said of raising the minimum wage.
""We will send a powerful signal to the people of New York, that we honour work... and that we are committed to making work pay.""
He also said his administration would help an estimated half a million undocumented New Yorkers out of a city of eight million residents.
""To all of my fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented, I say New York City is your home too,"" he said, ""and we will not force any of our residents to live their lives in the shadows.""
Of his plans to follow through on a central campaign pledge by delivering universal pre-kindergarten, Mr de Blasio said it would tax the wealthy not to ""punish success"" but to ""create more success stories"".
Although the city council is controlled by Mr de Blasio's Democratic allies, the minimum-wage plan needs support from the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, to become law.
Mr Cuomo is also a Democrat, but he is facing an election in November and has refused to raise taxes, instead proposing to fund universal pre-kindergarten out of the state budget.
Later this week, Mr de Blasio will deliver another important speech, outlining his plans for the city's $70bn (Â£42bn) budget.
The New York mayor has cheered liberal supporters with some of his stances early in his administration.

29,30,targeted threat,France teacher attack: Macron hails murdered âquiet heroâ,21 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54639343,"French President Emmanuel Macron has paid tribute to ""quiet hero"" Samuel Paty, the teacher who was beheaded last Friday.
Mr Paty was targeted close to his school near Paris for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class.
His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police.
Speaking at a televised memorial service on Wednesday, Mr Macron told viewers that France ""will not give up our cartoons"".
The service was attended by the teacher's family and some 400 guests.
The coffin was brought into the ceremony on the shoulders of a guard of honour and to the sound of the song ""One"" by the rock group U2.
On top of the casket was Mr Paty's LÃ©gion d'Honneur, France's highest honour. It was posthumously awarded to Mr Paty.
Mr Macron said Mr Paty had tried to teach his pupils how to become citizens.
""He was killed precisely because he incarnated the Republic"", Mr Macron said. ""He was killed because the Islamists want our future. They know that with quiet heroes like him, they will never have it.""
Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October.
The history and geography teacher had advised Muslim students to look away if they thought they might be offended.
Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God).
On Wednesday, prosecutors said Anzorov had paid two teenage students around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) to identify Mr Paty.
The killer told the students he wanted to ""film the teacher [and] make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said at a press conference.
The students, aged 14 and 15, are alleged to have described Mr Paty, 47, to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours outside the school until the teacher appeared, Mr Ricard said.
The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are two of seven people the French authorities are seeking to prosecute over the brutal attack.
The prosecutor also said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the killing and an online hate campaign orchestrated against Mr Paty.
The campaign was allegedly launched by the father of one of his pupils. The man, 48, who has been named in French media only as Brahim C, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher.
On Wednesday, Mr Ricard confirmed reports that Brahim C, who is also facing prosecution, had exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack.
He also posted videos denouncing Mr Paty after he showed the cartoons in two lessons about free speech earlier this month.
But Mr Ricard said the father's anger and statements in the videos were based on ""inaccurate facts"" because his daughter had not been in the relevant lessons.
Mr Paty's killer, Anzorov, was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008.",Yes

He was handed several thousand pounds, before walking out of the building.
Det Sgt Rob Norman, from Cambridgeshire Police, said: ""This man walked into the bank and handed the note to the member of staff, only speaking to ask her to hurry up, before calmly walking out with the money.

35,36,targeted threat,France teacher attack: Seven charged over Samuel Paty's killing,22 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54632353,"Seven people have been charged over the death of a French teacher who was beheaded close to his school last week.
Samuel Paty, 47, was targeted for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his students.
His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after last Friday's attack.
But seven people, including two students and a parent of one of Mr Paty's pupils, were detained in the days following the killing.
On Wednesday, prosecutors said six of the suspects had been charged with complicity in a terrorist murder and placed under judicial investigation.
One man is accused of having close contact with the killer and faces the lesser charge of associating with a terrorist.
All of the suspects, other than the two students who are minors at just 14 and 15, are in custody.
Mr Paty's killing stunned France and led to an outpouring of support at memorial ceremonies and marches around the country.
On Wednesday evening, President Emmanuel Macron hailed Mr Paty as ""a quiet hero"" and ""the face of the Republic"" at an event in Paris.
He then presented the teacher's family with the nation's highest honour, the LÃ©gion d'honneur.
France's chief anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard announced the charges on Wednesday, and gave fuller details of the police investigation at a press conference.
Two teenage students, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were allegedly paid around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) by the killer to identify Mr Paty outside the school.
The killer told the students he wanted to ""hit"" and ""humiliate"" Mr Paty and ""make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", Mr Ricard said.
The teenagers are alleged to have described the teacher to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours until Mr Paty appeared.
A man named only as Brahim C, a parent of one of Mr Paty's pupils, is also under investigation. The 48-year-old is accused of orchestrating a hate campaign against Mr Paty and exchanging text messages with the killer before the attack.
On Wednesday, Mr Ricard said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the online campaign and Mr Paty's death.
Also in custody is Abdelhakim Sefrioui, a preacher and activist who was reportedly known to the French intelligence services for years.
Both he and Brahim C made videos in which they reportedly insulted Mr Paty and demanded his suspension.
Earlier, Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin told Europe 1 radio that the pair had ""apparently launched a fatwa against the teacher"".
Three friends of Anzorov are also facing prosecution. One of them allegedly drove him to the school, while another is accused of helping him purchase a weapon.
Both men have been charged with complicity in a terrorist murder while the third was charged with the lesser offence of terrorist association.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, it emerged that Anzorov had been in contact with a Russian-speaking jihadist in Syria before he carried out the attack.
Anzorov was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008.
The teacher had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October.
Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God).
The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
A trial is currently under way over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 following their publication.

A spokesman for South Wales Police said they had been ""made aware of"" the threats and were ""monitoring the situation"".

During celebrations after Swansea City's 2-1 victory over Carlisle United in the final on 2 April, Trundle was also seen wearing a T-shirt with an image of a Swansea player urinating on a Cardiff shirt.

Both players have been arrested and questioned by South Wales Police, and are due to answer bail at the end of April.

The pair could also face possible professional discipline after the Football Association of Wales decided charges would be issued against both the club and the two players over the post-match events.

The plans follow the report of the Near Earth Object Task Force last year, which identified a number of areas in which the UK could spearhead any defence programme.
 
A review will look at how UK telescopes can monitor Neos, while a specialist facility will be set up to provide information.

Asteroid forum

There are also plans for the European Space Agency, and possibly the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to hold meetings of ""decision makers"" this year to discuss the danger.
Other measures being considered are plans to evacuate areas that could be hit by smaller objects and for international research into methods to divert objects away from Earth.
The Neos are believed to be the remnants from the formation of planets. 

The Earth's atmosphere protects against most Neos smaller than about 50m but larger objects can penetrate.  

Fortunately, objects in excess of 50m in diameter are unlikely to hit the Earth more than once a century.

Vital technology

The authors of the report pointed to Britain's strong astronomy track record, suitable telescope facilities, and ability to produce vital technology such as imaging chips.

Lord Sainsbury said: ""The potential threat of asteroids and other Near Earth Objects to our planet is an international problem requiring international action.

""The UK through the measures announced can play an important part in how the international community tackles this potential problem.""

Monitoring programme

The minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will be going ahead with the monitoring programme and putting into place facilities to communicate with the public on what the situation is.

""Clearly, if it is not a large [object], there is always a possibility of
moving people from the area it is going to hit on the Earth and we do potentially have the opportunity to deflect it.""

Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik, who launched a campaign in March 1999 to have the asteroid danger taken seriously, welcomed the government announcement.

He said: ""We must look at the practicalities of implementation. How do we track the objects? How can we divert them?

Night-time patrols have been stepped up by the Aspinall Foundation, which runs Port Lympne and Howletts wildlife parks near Canterbury.
Police said they had an anonymous tip-off the foundation's black rhinos could be targeted by poachers, who sell the horns for traditional medicine.
The foundation currently has 20 black rhinos at the two parks.
The animals are locked up at night, but the parks are asking local people to help increase the patrols.
Bob O'Connor, the managing director of the two parks, said: ""We had a call from Kent Police saying they had been informed through Crimestoppers that someone intended to harm our rhino.
""Over the last few years there has been a trend for breaking into museums and stealing stuffed rhino heads for their horns, including one recently in Kent.""
He said keepers live on-site at the parks and carry out patrols overnight.
""With this level of threat, and it's impossible to judge what the threat is, we have now stepped up those night-time patrols and we are asking local people to work with our staff to increase the number of patrols.""
He said a rhino horn could sell for up to Â£200,000.
Michael Laidlow, the wildlife and rural environmental crime co-ordinator for Kent Police said the force had received anonymous information that the parks may be attacked.
""We've taken steps to deal with it by informing the park and making officers aware of what the threat is.
""We take every threat seriously, especially when it deals with the rhinos,"" he said.
Over the last seven years 33 black rhinos have been born in the foundation's parks and members of the critically endangered species have been returned to the wild.
Last year three animals from Port Lympne were released in Tanzania.
Poachers target animals living in the wild in Africa. The horns are used in traditional medicine in countries such as China and Vietnam.
Damian Aspinall said: ""It is tragic and beyond belief that, as we do everything possible to restore these magnificent animals safely to the wild, the human traders who seek to profit from their slaughter should bring their vile activities to the UK.""

39,40,targeted threat,Triple threat targets Word users,20 December 2006,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6196213.stm,"Three unpatched bugs in Word have been uncovered in the last few weeks and two are already being exploited by attackers.

The loopholes being exploited allow attackers to create booby-trapped documents that steal information or take over a PC when they are opened.

Microsoft has yet to release patches to fix the bugs in the Word software.


Attack pattern

Information about the latest problem in Word was posted only a couple of days after Microsoft released its latest security update.

Over the last year malicious hackers have taken to releasing code soon after the regularly-scheduled monthly Microsoft security update to give them the biggest chance to abuse it before a patch appears.

So far the latest Word exploit, which revolves around the way the information describing formatting is handled, is only a proof-of-concept flaw but Symantec and McAfee have confirmed that it will work.

Abusing the flaw could allow attackers to take over a PC or run malicious code on a compromised machine.

The latest flaw joins two others that Microsoft has acknowledged are already being exploited in attacks which it describes as ""limited and targeted"".

To avoid falling victim it said: ""users should always exercise extreme caution when opening unsolicited attachments from both known and unknown sources"". 

Malicious Word documents exploiting one bug discovered in early December are known to have been spammed out to firms in Asia.

Together the three vulnerabilities are found in Microsoft Word 2000, 2002, Office 2003, Word Viewer 2003, Word 2004 for Mac, and Word v. X for Mac and Works 2004, 2005, and 2006.

Microsoft pointed out that to fall victim to the attacks users must receive and then open a booby-trapped Word document. 

On its security blog Microsoft said it was actively investigating the three problems and would release patches when work was complete.

40,41,targeted threat,Covid-19: PM urges 'optimistic but patient approach' to pandemic,15 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56075832,"People must be ""optimistic but patient"" about the coronavirus situation in the UK and the end to restrictions, Boris Johnson has said.
The PM hailed the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to ""relax"".
He said there were still more people in hospital than at the peak of the first wave, and steps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"".
He is to set out a roadmap next week for lifting England's restrictions.
The government said on Sunday that it had met its pledge to offer at least one Covid vaccine dose to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. More than 15 million people have received a first dose, according to the latest government figures.
Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson hailed the ""unprecedented national achievement"" of hitting the target, but warned the threat from the virus remained ""very real"".
The prime minister warned that the government did not have all the ""hard facts"" about how the vaccine impacted infections and that there were still more people in hospital with Covid-19 than in April - with admissions running at 1,600 a day across the UK.
""We have to keep our foot to the floor,"" he said.
Mr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending England's restrictions, but that the government wanted this lockdown ""to be the last"", with ""cautious but irreversible"" progress.
He added his plan next week would set out ""as much as we possibly can about the route to normality, even though some things are very uncertain"".
Although he said he was ""increasingly optimistic"" he admitted he could not give ""an absolute cast-iron guarantee that we won't face further difficulties"".
""I don't want people to think I'm not optimistic. There's been a big change - science is now in the ascendency over the disease,"" he added.
Mr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year.
""I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,"" he said.
Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the ""acknowledgement"" would give late night businesses ""the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time"".
""But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity,"" he added.
Could this be the last lockdown?
That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the government's stated aim.
It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in.
Who knew then that we'd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later?
Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis.
Today, again, he's urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well.
That's because ministers really don't want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation.
It comes after more than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend, calling for a commitment to a ""free life"" and the ending of lockdown measures before May.
Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine.
Earlier, No 10 said the intention was to ""start getting"" pupils back into school on 8 March, but was not ruling out the possibility that they could be sent back in stages.
The PM's official spokesman said it was ""important"" the planned review of restrictions was carried out this week, with details to be set out in Mr Johnson's road map on Monday.
The spokesman said he would not ""pre-empt"" what the road map might contain, but added: ""It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March, if the science and evidence allows.""
The government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups - including everyone over the age of 50 - by the end of April, Mr Johnson said.
This would run alongside giving second doses within the 12-week window to those in the top four priority groups, who have already had a first dose.
All those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers, are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination.
With every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid.
Science, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy.
It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago.
But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results.
There is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants.
No vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it. That's why advances in treatment are vital, too.
A cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances.
There is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back.
Speaking at the same Downing Street briefing, NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as ""two sprints and a marathon"".
He said the UK had passed the ""finishing line of the first sprint"" and now had a ""second sprint between now and 30 April"" to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups.
The ""marathon"" will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible, alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed, Sir Simon added.
Meanwhile, on Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October.
A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.

Mr Craig, 61, has opposed plans to build the UK's biggest mosque, Abbey Mills mosque in West Ham.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""Officers will view the video in due course to ascertain whether any criminal offences have been committed.""


Islamic group Tablighi Jamaat plans to build a 12,000 capacity mosque on land in West Ham, close to the Olympic Park site. 

'Sick joke'

Speaking to the BBC Mr Craig, a member of the Christian Peoples Alliance on Newham council, said a friend brought the video to his notice a week ago.

The video, which includes pictures of the councillor, his wife and young daughters, was posted by a 23-year-old Muslim man from Stevenage.

Mr Craig said: ""I thought it was pretty awful. If its a joke, its an extremely sick joke, especially putting my children up on it.""

He said he registered a case with the Forest Gate police station on Monday.

""I refuse to be intimidated and I intend to get on with my life and the opposition to the mosque. You can't live in fear,"" Mr Craig added.

Online petition

A spokesman for Abbey Mills mosque said: ""We are not responsible for the content of external websites. But we condemn totally anyone who incites violence. 

""If this has been reported to the police then it is right that they should investigate it.""

Tablighi Jamaat has appointed architects Allies and Morrison, whose previous projects include The Royal Festival Hall, to build the mosque. 

The mosque is still at a design stage and is estimated to cost between £50m to £75m, a spokesman for the mosque said.

Mr Craig said he is not opposed to plans to build the mosque but said he does not approve the group behind the project, which he describes as being a ""separatist and isolationist"" group.

In July an online petition against the construction of the mosque put up on the Downing Street website was signed by more than 255,000 people. 

Then London Mayor Ken Livingstone said the petition was part of a ""vicious"" campaign to spread untruths about the scheme.

The other detainees include four family members of the killer, a father at the school and a known Islamist radical.
Police carried out some 40 raids on the homes of suspected radicals on Monday and more raids are expected.
The brutal killing has shocked France.
Tens of thousands of people took part in rallies across the country on Sunday to honour Mr Paty and defend freedom of speech. A ceremony paying tribute to Mr Paty, who was 47, will be held at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Wednesday.
A man named as 18-year-old Abdoulakh A was shot dead by police on Friday after killing Mr Paty close to his school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a north-west suburb of Paris.
Four school pupils who may have helped identify Mr Paty to his killer in exchange for payment have been detained, a judicial source told the AFP news agency on Monday.
This brings to a total of 15 the number of people taken into custody in the aftermath of the murder.
The killer's grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother were detained shortly after the gruesome attack.
The father of a pupil who reportedly launched an online campaign against Mr Paty and a preacher described by French media as a radical Islamist were among six people arrested on Saturday. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin accused the two men of having issued a ""fatwa"" against the teacher.
The dozens of raids on Monday targeting suspected Islamist radicals were not necessarily linked to the investigation into Mr Paty's murder.
But Mr Darmanin said police would be interviewing about 80 people who were believed to have posted messages in support of the killing.
""We want to harass and destabilise this movement in a very determined way,"" an interior ministry source told AFP.
The government also said it was probing 51 French Muslim associations. It said if any were found to be promoting hatred, they would be closed down.
One organisation, the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), was labelled an ""enemy of the state"" by Mr Darmanin.
The organisation, which monitors anti-Muslim hate crime in France, has accused the minister of slander after he claimed the group was ""obviously"" involved in Friday's attack.
In a statement following news of the attack, the CCIF expressed ""our pain and our sadness to the family of this teacher"".
Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech earlier in October.
As he had done in similar lessons in recent years, Mr Paty, a history and geography teacher, advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended.
Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims because Islamic tradition explicitly forbids images of Muhammad and Allah (God).
The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the famous publishing of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A trial is currently underway over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015.
Some French-Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country.
Abdoulakh A is understood to have been an 18-year-old Chechen, born in Moscow, who had been living in the Normandy town of Ãvreux, about 100km (60 miles) from the murder scene. He had no known links to either Mr Paty or his school.
Mr Ricard said that the killer went to the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher.
The suspect followed Mr Paty as he walked home from work. He then used a knife to attack the teacher, before beheading him.
Witnesses are said to have heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"".
When police responded to the scene and confronted him, he fired at them with an airgun. Officers returned fire, hitting him nine times. A 30cm-long (12in) blade was found close by.

43,44,targeted threat,France teacher attack: Rallies held to honour beheaded Samuel Paty,18 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54589241,"Thousands have attended rallies across France in honour of Samuel Paty, the teacher beheaded after showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his pupils.
People in the Place de la RÃ©publique in Paris carried the slogan ""Je suis enseignant"" (I am a teacher), with PM Jean Castex saying: ""We are France!""
A man named as Abdoulakh A was shot dead by police on Friday after killing Mr Paty close to his school near Paris.
An 11th person has now been arrested as part of the investigation.
No details have been given about the arrest. Four close relatives of the suspect were detained shortly after the killing. Six more people were held on Saturday, including the father of a pupil at the school and a preacher described by French media as a radical Islamist.
President Emmanuel Macron said the attack bore all the hallmarks of an ""Islamist terrorist attack"" and the teacher had been murdered because he ""taught freedom of expression"".
The murder comes as a trial over the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo - a satirical magazine that has published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad - is under way.
The Place de la RÃ©publique in Paris filled with people rallying in support of Mr Paty, 47. Mr Castex and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined them.
The square was the scene of a huge demonstration in which 1.5 million people showed solidarity with Charlie Hebdo following the deadly attack of January 2015.
One protester on Sunday carried a sign reading ""zero tolerance to all enemies of the Republic"", another ""I am a professor. I'm thinking of you, Samuel.""
Another told Le Figaro she was a French Muslim who was at the rally to express her disgust at the latest killing.
A minute's silence was followed by the playing of the Marseillaise. All the protesters were wearing masks to protect from coronavirus.
Mr Castex tweeted the rendition of the anthem, along with the words ""you do not scare us... we are France!""
Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said France would succeed in defeating the enemies of democracy if it were united and that all teachers in France needed support.
Nathalie, a teacher from Chelles who was at the Paris rally, told Le Monde she was there because she had ""realised you can die of teaching"".
In Lille, people carried banners and placards with the simple words ""I am Samuel"".
Thousands of people also gathered in Place Bellecour in Lyon to pay their respects, with another large turnout in Nantes.
Demonstrations are also being held in Toulouse, Strasbourg, Marseille, Bordeaux and elsewhere.
In addition to Sunday's demonstrations, there will be a national tribute paid to Mr Paty on Wednesday.
On Saturday, Tareq Oubrou, imam of a mosque in Bordeaux, told France Inter: ""A civilisation does not kill an innocent person, barbarism does.""
Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said that the suspect, who lived in the Normandy town of Ãvreux, about 100km (60 miles) from the murder scene, went to Mr Paty's school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher.
Abdoulakh A, an 18-year-old born in Moscow of Chechen origin, had no apparent connection with the teacher or the school.
He followed Mr Paty as he walked home from work. The suspect used a knife to attack the teacher in the head, and then beheaded him.
Witnesses are said to have heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"".

As he had done in similar lessons in recent years, Mr Paty, a history and geography teacher, advised Muslim students to look away if they thought they might be offended.
A parent of one of the pupils reacted angrily, and went to the school to complain.
He and another man who accompanied him - Abdelhakim Sefrioui, a preacher and activist - made videos calling Mr Paty a ""voyou"" (thug) and demanding his suspension.

44,45,targeted threat,Muted response as Clap for Heroes returns,7 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55579680,"A revived initiative to applaud the heroes of the pandemic has returned - but much more quietly than last year.
It comes after the founder of Clap for Carers distanced herself from its return after facing online abuse.
Annemarie Plas wanted to bring back the weekly applause under a new name of Clap for Heroes to lift spirits in the new lockdown but it fell a little flat.
Some health workers have said they would rather people stay at home and wear a mask than clap for them.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he participated at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, but clapping ""isn't enough"".
""They need to be paid properly and given the respect they deserve,"" he tweeted., of the health workers.
The idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time.
After proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks last year, with millions of people across the UK taking part.
Members of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support.
However, the event faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause.
Thursday's newly-revived event drew fewer supporters than previously.
People in some streets stood on doorsteps and leaned out windows to clap for the pandemic's heroes, and landmarks in London were illuminated blue for the occasion - but reports suggested the applause was noticeably quieter than last year.
On Wednesday, Ms Plas, a 36-year-old mother-of-one, announced the return of the initiative, saying she hoped to ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"".
But some NHS workers were less than enthusiastic. Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant from Wales, tweeted: ""No thanks. I'd rather you obey the rules, stay at home, wear masks and wash your hands.""
And palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke said: ""Please don't clap us. Just wear a mask, wash your hands and respect lockdown.""
In a tweet posted hours before the weekly clap was due to return, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said she had been targeted with personal abuse and threats against her and her family by ""a hateful few"" on social media.
""I have no political agenda, I am not employed by the government, I do not work in PR, I am just an average mum at home trying to cope with the lockdown situation,"" she said, in a statement.
She said the newly revived clap could and should still happen at 20:00 GMT.
""It's up to each person to decide how relevant or worthwhile they feel it is to participate,"" she said.",Yes

Twenty-two people were killed and 59 injured when a man set off a bomb in the foyer at the end of a concert by Ariana Grande on Monday.
Humberside Police said they were bringing in extra armed officers and explosive sniffer dogs in response.
BBC Radio 1 said its focus was safety and it was working with police ahead of the festival.
Andy McDyer, Assistant Chief Constable of Humberside Police, said concertgoers would see ""heightened security"" at entrances and dropping-off points.
He said armed officers would be present for public protection, with airport-style security measures in place.
Police explosive sniffers dogs will also be on site, he said.
However, Mr McDyer added that the measures were a precaution and there was no intelligence to suggest the event would be targeted.
The UK terror threat level is now up to its highest level of ""critical"", meaning more attacks may be imminent.
In a statement, BBC Radio 1 said: ""Our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those affected by the tragic events in Manchester.""
It said people attending the festival would need to ""go through two rounds of thorough searches - one round conducted at transport hubs where police will be present, and a second round of security procedures at the entrance gates"" as part of the extra measures put in place.
""We ask for the patience and cooperation of anyone coming to the event on the weekend and that they allow extra time to pass through security,"" the station added.

46,47,targeted threat,WWF: Canada endangered species face 'staggering losses',2 September 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54004835,"Canadian wildlife at risk of extinction has undergone ""staggering"" losses over the past 50 years, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation group says.
In a report, the charity says that species at risk of global extinction have seen their Canadian populations fall by over 40% between 1970 and 2016.
Populations of species that are at risk of extinction in Canada itself fell even more dramatically - by 59%.
The report said human activity was mostly to blame.
Wednesday's report is based on the Living Planet Index, which measures the ecological performance of 883 species around the world, including the North Atlantic Right Whale and the Barren Ground Caribou.
The report found that endangered species were likely to face at least five threats, such as habitat loss, land and shoreline developments and pollution, and that human-activity was mostly to blame.
Climate change and biodiversity loss accelerated the impacts of those threats the animals were already facing, the report said.
""Conservation actions that target only a single threat are unlikely to successfully stop and reverse wildlife declines as threats to species are often cumulative or synergistic and can have cascading effects,"" the report said.
In the case of the Right Whale, climate change shifted the whale's migratory pattern to more commercial areas where they became vulnerable to ship strikes and more frequently became entangled in shipping gear.
The report also pointed to recent research that found that indigenous-managed lands had more species than other parts of Canada, and better supported at-risk wildlife.
The report suggested working with Canada's indigenous people to create more Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas.
Canada is not alone in this crisis. A recent study found that humans have pushed 500 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians to the brink of extinction.",Yes
47,48,targeted threat,Catherine McKenna: Canada environment minister given extra security,8 September 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49627153,"Canada's environment minister says she has been assigned a security detail because of abuse she has received both online and in person.
Catherine McKenna said in one recent incident a man in a car pulled up alongside her and her children, swore and called her a ""climate Barbie"".
In Canada, government ministers rarely need high levels of protection.
The move comes as environmental campaigners, particularly women, report increasing levels of abuse.
Climate change has become a major issue in Canada's federal election in October, with the two main parties taking opposing stances on the subject.
Ms McKenna said she would now have extra protection at certain times, but did not give details.
""There are places, yes, that I have to have security now and I don't think that's a great situation,"" she said, quoted by Canadian Press news agency.
""I'm someone who is trying to do my job, live my life, and talk and engage with people, and it makes it harder. I'm not going to let this stop me but I wish it would stop.""
Online abuse has been going on since she was elected, she added, but in recent months public confrontations have become worse.
She said she had received messages that included sexualised insults and threats against her family. In person she has been called an enemy, a traitor and a ""communist piece of garbage"".
""The vocal sexism and hateful comments that are directed to people who work on climate change is unacceptable,"" she told AFP news agency.
Two years ago Canadian Conservative MP Gerry Ritz apologised to Ms McKenna after calling her ""climate Barbie"".
As the climate change debate rages, many activists have found themselves the targets of threats and abuse.
Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired a global movement, recently completed a voyage across the Atlantic on board an environmentally friendly yacht - but faced a barrage of attacks along the way.
""Freak yachting accidents do happen in August,"" Arron Banks, a UK businessman and prominent Brexit campaigner, tweeted. He later dismissed his comments as a joke.
Canadian environmental activist Tzeporah Berman recently revealed that she had received anti-Semitic abuse, death threats, and threats of sexual violence over her stance on Canada's controversial oil sands industry.
The government of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has imposed carbon taxes on four of Canada's 10 provinces for failing to introduce their own plans for tackling climate change.
In October's election, in which Mr Trudeau will seek a second term, his Conservative rival Andrew Scheer has vowed to roll back the tax as his first act in office if elected.",Yes
48,49,targeted threat,France teacher attack: Students 'paid â¬300' to identify Samuel Paty,21 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54625270,"Two students were paid to identify a teacher to the man who beheaded him last Friday in an attack that shocked France, prosecutors have alleged.
Samuel Paty was targeted close to his school near Paris for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class.
His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack.
On Wednesday, prosecutors said Anzorov had paid two teenage students around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) to identify Mr Paty.
The killer told the students he wanted to ""film the teacher [and] make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said at a press conference.
He said Anzorov had told them he wanted ""to humiliate him, to hit him"".
The students, aged 14 and 15, are alleged to have described Mr Paty, 47, to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours outside the school until the teacher appeared, Mr Ricard said.
The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are two of seven people the French authorities are seeking to prosecute over the brutal attack.
The prosecutor also said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the killing and an online hate campaign that was orchestrated against Mr Paty.
The campaign was allegedly launched by the father of one of his pupils. The man, 48, who has been named in French media only as Brahim C, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher.
On Wednesday, Mr Ricard confirmed reports that Brahim C, who is also facing prosecution, had exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack.
He also posted videos denouncing Mr Paty after he showed the cartoons in two lessons about free speech earlier this month
But Mr Ricard said the father's anger and statements in the videos were based on ""inaccurate facts"" because his daughter had not been in the relevant lessons.
The prosecutor's revelations come ahead of a national memorial service in Paris for Mr Paty.
President Emmanuel Macron will attend the event at the Sorbonne University on Wednesday evening, along with the teacher's family and some 400 guests.
He is expected to posthumously give Mr Paty France's highest award, the Legion d'Honneur,
Earlier, the president held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged co-operation in fighting terrorism. Mr Putin described the attack as a ""barbarous murder"".
Mr Paty's killer, Anzorov, was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008.
Mr Macron said he wanted to see a ""strengthening of Franco-Russian co-operation in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration"", the French presidency said.
Russia has played down any association with the attacker. ""This person had lived in France for the past 12 years,"" a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Paris told the Tass news agency on Saturday.
Police have raided some 40 homes following the attack, and the government also ordered a mosque to close for six months.
The Pantin mosque, just north of Paris, was closed after it emerged it had shared videos on Facebook calling for action against Mr Paty.
In one clip, posted just days before the attack, it also shared his school's address.
The mosque later expressed ""regret"" over the videos, which it has deleted, and condemned the teacher's killing.
Meanwhile, mosques in the south-western cities of Bordeaux and Beziers were put under police protection after they reported threats.
""Such actions are unacceptable on the soil of the Republic,"" Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said in a tweet on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, President Macron said the Sheikh Yassin Collective - an Islamist group named after the founder of the Palestinian militant group Hamas - would be outlawed for being ""directly involved"" in the killing.
He said the ban was a way of helping France's Muslim community from the influence of radicalism.
Mr Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October.

Mr Paty, who was killed on Friday, had earlier shown controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his pupils.
The 48-year-old father, who has not been officially named, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher.
The brutal murder of Mr Paty, 47, has shocked France.
Tens of thousands of people took part in rallies across France at the weekend to honour him and defend freedom of speech. A silent march was held on Tuesday evening in the suburb north-west of Paris where he was killed.
A man named as 18-year-old Abdoulakh A was shot dead by police after killing Mr Paty on Friday.
The father of the pupil is reported to have exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack close to the teacher's school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.
He is accused, along with a preacher described by French media as a radical Islamist, of calling for Mr Paty to be punished by issuing a so-called ""fatwa"" (considered a legal ruling by Islamic scholars).
Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said the two men had been arrested and were being investigated for an ""assassination in connection with a terrorist enterprise"".
Police launched a series of raids targeting Islamist networks on Monday, and some 40 homes were targeted.
On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said the Sheikh Yassin Collective - an Islamist group named after the founder of the Palestinian militant group Hamas - would be outlawed for being ""directly involved"" in the killing.
He said the ban was a way of helping France's Muslim community, Europe's largest, from the influence of radicalism.
The group's leader is among 16 people who were taken into custody in the aftermath of the murder.
Six have now been released after questioning including the killer's grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother. Four school students are believed to remain in detention.
Mr Darmanin earlier said 51 French Muslim organisations, including charities and NGOs, would be inspected by government officials and closed down if they were found to be promoting hatred.
He said police would also be interviewing about 80 people who were believed to have posted messages in support of the killing.
Also on Tuesday, the French government ordered a mosque to close for sharing videos on Facebook calling for action against Mr Paty and sharing his school's address in the days before his death.
The Pantin mosque, which has about 1,500 worshippers and is situated just north of Paris, will close for six months on Wednesday. The mosque expressed ""regret"" over the videos, which it has deleted, and condemned the teacher's killing.
Beneath the public outrage there is a divided nation. A growing number of people believe France's rules on secularism and freedom of speech need to change.
Around 29% of Muslim respondents told a recent poll that Islam was incompatible with the values of the French Republic - a sharp increase over the past few years. And among those under 25, the figure was much higher.
The number of people who think violence is justified in response to cartoons of Muhammad is very small. But teachers in some areas say that view is growing among their pupils.
The roots of this rebellion against French national values are complex - conflicts abroad, racism, lack of opportunity and government policy all play a role.
It's hard to support the values of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity if they don't appear to apply to you.
Before this attack, President Macron had already promised a new law to target ""separatism"". But will it tackle the growing chasm or deepen the fault-lines once more?
On Monday, anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech earlier in October.

Mr Ricard said that the killer went to the school on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher. He then followed Mr Paty as he walked home from work and used a knife to attack him.
Tuesday evening's silent vigil in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine was attended by thousands. Earlier in the day, the French parliament observed a minute of silence.
Mr Macron will attend a ceremony with Mr Paty's family on Wednesday.

In a speech at the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr Abraham said ""a global clean-out of those radiological materials that remain in the world"" was a clear priority. 

He said concerns had deepened since the recent uncovering of a Pakistani-led black market in nuclear technology and in the light of the 11 September attacks. 

The initiative would focus on rounding up unused Russian highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel scattered around the world , as well as spent nuclear fuel from the US and Russia. 

Mr Abraham said it would aim to repatriate all unused Russian-origin HEU fuel by the end of next year and all spent nuclear fuel by 2010. 

He said the initiative would also work to convert civilian research reactors HEU reactors to use low enriched uranium fuel instead - not just in the US but across the globe.

51,52,targeted threat,Coronavirus: Hackers targeted Covid vaccine supply 'cold chain',3 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55165552,"The international vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, according to IBM.
The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery ""cold chain"" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation.
The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state.
It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research.
IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020.
It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance.
Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions.
This sometimes requires a ""cold chain"".
For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about.
The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email.
They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials.
That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines.
""Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target,"" IBM says.
IBM says the wider targeting included:
IBM says the campaign was uncovered by a security team it set up at the start of the pandemic to track down Covid-19 cyber-threats.
""The precision targeting and nature of the specific targeted organisations potentially point to nation-state activity,"" the US company said.
""Without a clear path to a [pay]out, cyber-criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation.""
IBM says it has notified those targeted as well as law-enforcement authorities.
The US's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has issued an alert encouraging organisations associated with the storage and transport of a vaccine to be on guard for the kind of attacks linked to IBM's report.
In July, the UK warned Russian intelligence had targeted UK vaccine research, including at Oxford.
The US also warned of Chinese hacking, while, more recently, Microsoft said it had seen North Korean and Russian hackers targeting vaccine research.

The blackmailer claimed to have poisoned items in German supermarkets, with traces later found in baby food.
Officials in the city of Konstanz say that the threatening email was sent to unspecified food retailers.
It is reported to have warned that food would be poisoned throughout Europe unless 11.7m euros were paid. Police are seeking one man seen on camera.
A nationwide alert for Germany has been issued after officials in the south of the country last week said they were informed that five jars of baby food had been tampered with.
The jars were found to contain ethylene glycol, an odourless toxic liquid. So far there are no reports of any injuries.
The colourless substance has a sweet taste and is known to attract children and animals.
Officials have not said which retailers were targeted.
""We are taking the threat very seriously,"" Konstanz deputy chief of police Uwe Stuermer said in a news conference. ""[But] there is no reason for panic or hysteria.""
Police have nevertheless alerted people buying groceries to be aware of suspect packaging which may have been tampered with.
Officers are pursuing a male suspect aged about 50 who appeared in security video footage in a supermarket located in a town near Konstanz.
The footage has been made public so that officers can, if necessary, rule him out of their inquiries.
Authorities in the south-western state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg have meanwhile pledged to increase the number of food safety checks to try and identify any contaminated items.
But they have warned that such measures cannot easily be carried out.
""The case is difficult because the blackmailer did not say which food will be targeted or what poison he will use,"" a consumer protection official quoted by Reuters said.",Yes

55,56,targeted threat,France teacher attack: Suspect 'asked pupils to point Samuel Paty out',17 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54581827,"The man who beheaded a teacher in a street in France waited outside the school and asked pupils to identify his target, anti-terrorism officials say.
The man then posted images on social media of dead victim Samuel Paty, 47, who had shown controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his students.
The attacker later fired at police with an airgun before being shot dead.
The number arrested rose to 10 on Saturday, with police investigating possible links to Islamic extremism.
The attack took place at about 17:00 (15:00 GMT) on Friday near the College du Bois d'Aulne, where Mr Paty taught, in the town of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, some 30km (20 miles) north-west of central Paris.
President Emmanuel Macron said the attack bore all the hallmarks of an ""Islamist terrorist attack"" and the teacher had been murdered because he ""taught freedom of expression"".
A national tribute will be paid to Mr Paty on Wednesday.
Details of the attack and investigation were given by the anti-terrorism state prosecutor, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard.
He named the suspect as Abdoulakh A. - an 18-year-old man, born in Moscow of Chechen origin. He came to France with refugee status as a boy and was unknown to anti-terrorism police.
He lived in the Normandy town of Ãvreux, about 100km (62 miles) from the murder scene and had no apparent connection with the teacher or the school.
The man had been before courts but only on minor misdemeanour charges.
He went to the college on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher, Mr Ricard said.
The attacker followed Mr Paty, who was heading home on foot after school, inflicted multiple wounds to the head with a knife and then beheaded the victim.
Witnesses are said to have heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"".
The man then posted photos of the victim to a Twitter account, along with insults to Mr Macron and French ""infidels"" and ""dogs"".
As police approached him, he fired rounds from an airgun at police, Mr Ricard said.
They returned fire. The suspect tried to get up and was shot again, being hit nine times in all.
A 30cm-long (12in) blade was found close by.
Mr Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech, in relation to the Charlie Hebdo case.
The French satirical magazine was the subject of a deadly attack in 2015 after publishing the cartoons. A trial over that attack is currently under way.
Mr Paty, a history and geography teacher, advised Muslim students to look away if they thought they might be offended.
A parent of one of the pupils reacted angrily to the incident, accusing Mr Paty of showing naked pictures of the Prophet Muhammad. The father lodged a formal complaint and produced videos demonstrating the anger at Mr Paty's actions, and calling on people to go to the school to protest.
The father is one of the people in custody, Mr Ricard said, adding that this man's half-sister had joined the Islamic State organisation in Syria in 2014.
At least one of the other people arrested was known to anti-terrorism police, he said, with other links being investigated.
And at least four of the 10 now arrested are relatives of the attacker.
Mr Ricard said this was the second attack since the Charlie Hebdo trial got under way. A man attacked and wounded two people outside the magazine's former offices.
Mr Ricard said there was an ""ongoing extremely high level of terrorism threat on French soil"".
Teachers across France told journalists of their fear, stunned by the targeting of a colleague murdered in broad daylight in a quiet suburban street.
Aside from the horror of this killing, there's powerful symbolism too. The education minister said the root of what happened was ""hatred of the Republic"".
The passing on of French national values - liberty, equality, fraternity - is seen as a core task of the education system here.
Three weeks after an attack on the former offices of Charlie Hebdo, this latest killing is yet more proof of the fault-lines over secularism and tolerance, which have left blood before in the country's streets.
Students were said to be distraught at the brutal killing of a well-liked teacher. One father wrote on Twitter that his daughter ""is in pieces, terrorised by the violence of such an act. How will I explain to her the unthinkable?""
One of Mr Paty's former students, Martial, 16, said he had loved his job: ""He really wanted to teach us things - sometimes we had debates"".
The French presidency said a national tribute would be held for Mr Paty, and the hashtag #JeSuisSamuel (I am Samuel) began trending on social media, echoing the #JeSuisCharlie call for solidarity after the attack on Charlie Hebdo.
Speaking at the scene hours after the incident, President Macron stressed national unity. ""They will not prevail, they will not divide us,"" he said.
Charlie Hebdo on Friday tweeted: ""Intolerance just reached a new threshold and seems to stop at nothing to impose terror in our country.""
Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, who met leaders from teaching unions on Saturday, said in a recorded statement that Mr Paty had been killed by the ""enemies of freedom"" and France would ""never back down when confronted by terror, intimidation"".
Muslim leaders in France also condemned the attack. ""A civilisation does not kill an innocent person, barbarism does,"" Tareq Oubrou, imam of a mosque in Bordeaux, told France Inter.
The Strasbourg-based Assembly of Chechens in Europe said in a statement: ""Like all French people, our community is horrified by this incident.""",Yes
56,57,targeted threat,Policing body member targeted,17 September 2003,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3115298.stm,"A breeze block was put through the back window of Marian Quinn's husband's car at Coshowen, in Galliagh in the early hours of Wednesday morning. 


A petrol container was found by the fire service on the back seat. 


Mrs Quinn said the police warned her on Tuesday night that they had received a threat from the Real IRA that all Catholic members of the DPP throughout Northern Ireland are what they called ""legitimate targets"". 


She said she is still considering whether to leave the DPP.


""I am frightened for myself and I am frightened for my family, what mother wouldn't be,"" she said.


""But a stand has to be taken and these men have to be told no, enough is enough, we have just had enough of it.

	Jane Kennedy Security Minister 










""Nobody can tell me what a legitimate target is and I would really like some of them to come to me, speak to me and tell me what I am doing that is so wrong.""


The attack is the latest in a series of threats to members of policing partnerships across the province.


So far, two people have resigned their posts following intimidation.


Teresa Rooney, a member of Cookstown DPP, stood down on Tuesday and last week an independent nationalist in Fermanagh resigned following a threat from the Real IRA.





Other attacks have included an attack on a car belonging to a DDP member in Strabane which was set alight outside the school where he was teaching and a hoax bomb which was left outside the home of a DPP chairman in Tyrone. 


The Stormont Security Minister, Jane Kennedy, praised the bravery of the DPP members who have been targeted in the past week.
'Cowardly'



Mrs Kennedy said the security of all members is kept under review.


""I understand that these specific attacks have been brought forward by the Real IRA who owe allegiance to nobody and have utter disregard, it would appear to anyone,"" she said.


""This really is the lowest form of bullying.""


The vice-chairman of the Policing Board, Denis Bradley, said the attack on Mrs Quinn and others in the policing partnerships were reprehensible and must be totally condemned.

""This attack was an attack not just on Mrs Quinn and her family, but on the entire Catholic community by members of the Catholic community,"" he said.

""It is totally unacceptable and I know that the Catholic community will not allow itself to be threatened and bullied in this way.""


The Sinn Fein chairperson, Mitchel McLaughlin, condemned the attack as ""cowardly and unjustifiable"". 

He said that those responsible were devoid of political strategy.



News of the incidents came as Policing Oversight Commissioner Tom Constantine said that threats from dissident republicans to kill community policing board members were the biggest test yet for the new arrangements.




On Tuesday, Mr Constantine urged political leaders and clergymen to intensify efforts to combat the threat.

 ""The intimidation of citizens' groups trying to work with police has a chilling effect on the entire neighbourhood and community.""



 ""Some people, whether their reasons are political or criminal, want to

Policing Board Vice Chairman Denis Bradley said he feared more members of district policing partnerships would resign.   



""I think we are going to see more individuals leave. This is regrettable but is understandable because such people have to take into account family issues,"" he said.


The President of the Methodist Church in Northern Ireland, Reverend Jim Rea, called on the nationalist community and politicians to support the district policing partnerships.  



""Even though they may not necessarily agree with them serving on the partnerships, it's very important that they support their right to be there,"" he said.",Yes

59,60,targeted threat,"Online bullying: 'I've blocked nearly 10,000 abusive accounts'",8 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-55668872,"""I'd say at worst I was receiving 100 death threats a day online,"" Phoebe Jameson tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I have nearly 10,000 accounts blocked.""
We've all struggled over the past year, going in and out of lockdown, but for 19-year-old Phoebe there's been no escape online.
She was first trolled after posting body positive photos and messages on social media.
And she reckons the pandemic made things worse.
A photo Phoebe posted to mark International Women's Day in March last year sparked a torrent of abuse and attracted ""hundreds of comments"" about how she looked.
""This kept happening across the whole of 2020. It got to the point where from July, I have not had a week's break from any online abuse.
""In these last couple of months, it's been every single day, there will be something or some incident or some comment.""
Phoebe has been reporting abusive posts and blocking accounts that were sharing them.
Half of women and non-binary people polled by online abuse charity Glitch and the End Violence Against Women Coalition say they've experienced online abuse since the pandemic began.
And a poll of 2,000 people for the National Children's Bureau, which was published in November 2020, suggests that more people were experiencing and reporting online abuse as bullying in schools decreased - because most people were learning from home.
Phoebe says comments and DMs led to her making a suicide attempt in December.
""It got to the point where the comments made me feel like I couldn't be here anymore, really. I ended up in hospital.""
When she later posted about her suicide attempt online she received more abuse.
""It was horrific. I just logged off for the rest of Christmas and New Year to just enjoy it and not think about what's being said online,"" she says.
""I'm not in that place now, but I can't say I'm not going to be in that place again from trolling because, I didn't think that would ever happen to me, I never thought it would reach that point.""
Imran Ahmed is the CEO of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate. He says there has been an ""industrial level of trolling"" during the coronavirus pandemic, and part of this has included online bullying.
""Right now we are primed to think of things that aren't like us as being dangerous,"" he tells Newsbeat.
""Think about literally what Covid is - someone you love could kill you, just by coming near you.
""So we're primed to think, I don't want to see people, I don't want to get too close. We are in a hyper-disgust phase.""
He says people who troll others online don't get a thrill from the abuse they send, but from seeing the reaction from their victim.
""If you give them what they want and show anger and pain that incentivises them to gain that pleasure again.
""By taking away the possibility of gaining that pleasure, by blocking them, they'll stop.""
He also says defending someone against trolls can sometimes do more harm than good because you ""rebroadcast, compound and worsen the abuse.""
He says blocking and reporting abusive posts and accounts is still our best option, but also to remember that extreme cases may be against the law.
When Phoebe reported the death threats to her local police, they recommended she log off social media. She did that in the short term for her mental health, but it isn't something she wants to do permanently.
""This is becoming part of my life more especially  because we're all virtual now,"" Phoebe says.
""I don't want to have to censor myself, I think that's the other thing. I tried to be a positive person for others and for my teenage self. I'm trying to be the woman that my teenage self never had.
""It gets tough but I don't feel like I should have to step away because some people don't want me to be existing in that space.""
Avon and Somerset police, who Phoebe reported her situation to, says on its website that its officers will deal with online abuse only in the most extreme cases.
These include a threat to someone's life, targeting specific individuals and persistent harassment and ongoing abuse.
Phoebe's decided not to pursue matters with the police.
But she does want social media companies to make it harder to set up fake account on their platforms - which is where a lot of the abuse she experienced came from.
She's set up an organisation called The Speak Up Space, where victims of sexual violence and harassment can share their stories and look for help and advice.
And despite the abuse she receives, still feels like the positives of being social media outweigh the negatives.
""It was nice when I had a break, I just stuck to WhatsApp to stay in touch with friends and it felt like a weight lifted. But I also love the community I'm in and I love all these friends I've made and all these people who reach out to me and say these lovely things,"" she says.
""I don't want to be pushed out or something. And if I choose to leave, that's going to be my decision.
""We're all going through this at the moment, and of course, everyone's reaction is going to be different to the pandemic, but being abusive to people online is not a viable response.""

60,61,targeted threat,"Man fled to Scotland using IRA links, court hears",22 May 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-52774561,"A Dublin man wanted over a suspected bid to kill a PSNI officer allegedly used his IRA connections to flee to Scotland, a court heard today.
Sean Paul Farrell, 35, appeared before magistrates in Belfast after he was arrested and brought back to Northern Ireland.
He is charged with attempting to murder the off-duty policeman with an under-car bomb.
The incident happened in Eglinton, County Derry on 18 June, 2015.
Mr Farrell, with a previous address at Kilfenora Road, Crumlin, faces a further count of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life.
A detective said the improvised explosive device (IED) planted under the officer's car could have had ""devastating"" consequences.
In February this year the High Court in Dublin ordered Mr Farrell's extradition to Northern Ireland.
But according to police he went missing the following month.
He was detained under a warrant in the Glasgow area on Thursday.
Opposing bail at Belfast Magistrates' Court, an investigating detective claimed Mr Farrell would go on the run again if released.
""We believe he's a member of the IRA and that he has used his connections within the IRA to leave the Republic of Ireland and get to Scotland,"" he said.
""If he gets out, with all his connections, he will do the same.""
District Judge Fiona Bagnall was told the dissident paramilitary organisation remained active and posed a severe threat, targeting police officers, prison staff and members of the judiciary.
The detective told the court: ""There have been 200-plus incidents where ATO (Army Technical Officers) have been called to the IRA's work over a 12-month period.""
During cross-examination by a defence solicitor, he also confirmed there was no forensic evidence linking Farrell to the under-car bomb.
Mr Farrell was allegedly in a stolen car involved in the murder bid a number of hours later, when it was spotted in County Donegal.
Disputing police assertions that his client absconded, the lawyer insisted Mr Farrell had attended court throughout the extradition proceedings.
But despite offering a Â£10,000 surety, bail was refused due to the risk of flight.
Judge Bagnall remanded Mr Farrell in custody to appear again by video-link on 19 June.",Yes

Assistant Chief Constable Rebecca Sutcliffe said shots fired on Saturday in Salford and Bolton, and the shooting of a man in Salford, were linked.
There was no link with a fourth shooting in Bolton which happened later, she added.
Ms Sutcliffe appealed for local people to give police information.
""We absolutely need the community to come forward,"" she said.
A long-running investigation revealed a dispute between two ""serious and organised crime groups"" over the past 12 months, said ACC Sutcliffe of Greater Manchester Police (GMP).
In the first incident, a man was wounded in the back when he was shot through the window of his house in Mossbrook Drive, Little Hulton, at about 00:15 BST on Saturday. His condition is not known.
Later that day, two houses were sprayed with bullets in attacks at an address in Worsley Road, Bolton, at about 22:00 and one in Gorse Drive, Little Hulton nearly 90 minutes later. No-one was hurt.
Patrols had been stepped up but the shootings were ""targeted"" and there was no threat to the wider community, she added.
The three incidents are not being linked with a fourth shooting on Saturday afternoon in Bolton when a man was shot in the stomach outside a pub in Cannon Street, Bolton.",Yes
62,63,targeted threat,"Fort Hood attack 'defended Taliban', says suspect",4 June 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22777127,"A US Army psychiatrist accused of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting has said he will argue he targeted soldiers as they posed a threat to Taliban fighters.
Nidal Hasan said the ""leadership of the Taliban in general"" was in immediate danger from the personnel, who were about to deploy to Afghanistan.
But a military judge warned the 42-year-old he needed to show supporting evidence for his defence to be valid.
On Monday, he was allowed to represent himself in a court martial trial.
The US-born Muslim spoke during a hearing on Tuesday at the Texas military base where he is accused of the premeditated murder of 13.
He could be executed or face life in jail without parole if convicted.
The legal strategy Maj Hasan says he will use is known as a ""defence of others"" argument.
It requires him to prove that his actions protected people from immediate danger or death.
He also faces 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder for those who were wounded during the shooting.
The selection of a panel of officers who will act as the jury at his court martial is set to begin on Wednesday, and opening arguments are expected in July.",Yes
63,64,targeted threat,Israeli aircraft target IS position in Syrian Golan Heights,28 November 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38129683,"The Israeli Air Force has bombed a building used by Islamic State (IS) militants in the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights, Israel's military says.
The air raid targeted an abandoned UN peacekeeping facility used as a base for an attack on Sunday against Israeli soldiers on Israeli-occupied territory.
The four militants behind that attack were killed in an earlier strike.
It was believed to be the first direct assault by IS on Israeli troops in the Golan since Syria's civil war began.
The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted Israeli military officials as saying that that the ""abandoned military facility"" in the southern Golan targeted overnight had constituted ""a substantial threat in the area"".
In Sunday's incident, Israeli soldiers came under machine-gun and mortar fire, according to the Israeli military.
The air force bombed a vehicle carrying the assailants, whom the military said were members of the IS-linked Khaled Ibn al-Walid Brigade, a Syrian group formerly called the Yarmouk Martyrs' Brigade.
No Israeli soldiers were injured in the attack.
""Our forces are prepared on our northern border, and we won't let [IS] elements or other hostile elements use the cover of the war in Syria to establish themselves next to our borders,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
The Golan Heights, a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, has a political and strategic significance that belies its size.
Israel seized the region in the closing stages of the 1967 Six-Day War, and thwarted a Syrian attempt to retake it in 1973.
Both countries signed an armistice in 1974, after which a UN peacekeeping force was put in place to monitor the demilitarised zone.

64,65,targeted threat,UK cyber-threat agency confronts Covid-19 attacks,3 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54782258,"More than a quarter of the incidents which the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) responded to were Covid-related, according to its latest annual report.
The review covers the period from September 2019 to August 2020, so the pandemic occupied an even higher proportion of the agency's efforts after the first lockdown began.
In total there were 723 incidents of all kinds, marking close to a 10% rise on the previous period.
Of those, 194 were Covid-related.
Some of the incidents related to countering nation-state attacks, but most were criminal in nature, the GCHQ division reported.
It also disclosed that it had thwarted 15,354 campaigns that had used coronavirus themes as a ""lure"" to fool people into clicking on a link or opening an attachment containing malicious software.
Some involved fake shops selling PPE (personal protective equipment), test kits and even vaccines.
Protecting the NHS and health-related research has been a priority, the report said..
In July, the UK accused Russia of trying to steal vaccine-related information through cyber-espionage.
And officials said they had continued to see an ""ongoing threat"" of states targeting the vaccine research-and-delivery programme.
The NCSC said it had scanned more than one million NHS IP (internet protocol) addresses to look for vulnerabilities, and had shared 51,000 indicators of compromise.
It has also carried out ""threat hunting"" to look for security risks on connected devices, and worked on the security of the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app.
The NCSC also warned ransomware attacks had become more common.
Ransomware locks people out of their computers and demands victims make a blackmail payment to restore access - and even then it is not always granted.
The NCSC said it had handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents as in the previous year.
These included an attack against Redcar and Cleveland Council which, the officials said, had ""caused considerable damage and disruption"".
The report added the NCSC had observed a growing trend for such attacks to be more targeted and aggressive than previously.
Rather than just locking people out of access to their data until a ransom was paid, attackers often warned they would embarrass victims if they refused to comply.
""We have seen the threat of data being leaked,"" Paul Chichester, director of operations, told the BBC.
Examples included details of staff salaries being published online.
This meant victims were at risk even if they have backed up their data.
However, the NCSC said the UK did not appear to be as heavily targeted as some countries, because British victims were less likely to pay the attackers.
The NCSC has also been working to increase skills and diversity in the cyber-security industry.
It said almost 12,000 girls had taken part in its 2020 competition. However, an advert for the government's related CyberFirst campaign was widely criticised last month for featuring a ballerina and the slogan ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber"".
The report also highlighted the agency's role in protecting parliament as it became ""virtual"" to prevent hacking of debates or votes.
And it revealed that the NCSC had just updated the system for producing cryptographic keys, which encrypt classified government and military systems.
A new electronic system was introduced to replace old-fashioned punch-tape.",Yes
65,66,targeted threat,Why do broadcasters use College Green?,8 January 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46795958,"MPs say they now fear for their safety when they go to be interviewed by the media on a green opposite the Houses of Parliament. What is going on?
For decades now, College Green has been used as a venue for broadcast interviews.
For MPs, it has the advantage of being convenient - they simply have to stroll across the road from the House of Commons to be guaranteed a bigger audience for their views than they would ever get from speaking in the chamber.
For broadcasters, College Green provides the all-important sense of being at the heart the action, and gives them access to a steady stream of willing interviewees.
It has traditionally been seen as a haven for backbenchers eager to get on the airwaves. Broadcast insiders call it the ""honeypot"" - MPs booked to do an interview by one outlet are collared by producers from rival outlets as soon as they come off air and ushered towards another microphone.
Some MPs and ministers prefer to be interviewed in the more controlled, and less muddy, environment of the TV studio.
Most broadcasters, including the BBC, have studios at Westminster, not far from College Green - where they can be interviewed ""down the line"" by presenters in another location.
College Green has traditionally tended to be pressed into action on big Parliamentary occasions such as budgets or general elections. On really big occasions, the main evening news bulletins will be presented from an elevated platform on College Green, offering a commanding view of the Palace of Westminster all lit up at night for added drama.
News presenters don't always have parliamentary passes, so hosting bulletins or news channel segments from within the building itself is not possible. But the extra space and freedom of the open-air studio makes the green a more desirable location anyway.
TV cameras were not allowed in the Commons chamber until 1989 - and broadcasters were allowed to film interviews with MPs in the building in only 2000, initially from a glass booth in the central lobby. Strict rules remain about where cameras can be placed.
Filming on the green gives broadcasters more control, as well as allowing guests without parliamentary passes to take part in live debates.
One thing the broadcasters can't control, of course, is what goes on in the back of their shots.
Interruptions by placard-waving protesters are an occupational hazard for anyone filming outside Parliament.
People have every right to stage protests - the roads and greens around Parliament are public rights of way - and, in normal times, there is little real friction.
Brexit has changed that dynamic, however.
The media has set up what is starting to feel like a permanent tented village, as the story continues to dominate the news bulletins. They might not broadcast from there every day but it has become a focal point for demonstrators.
The site is now ringed by metal barriers and the police have increased their presence.
The BBC has no plans to stop broadcasting from College Green but does not intend to report from there every day.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with authorities and other broadcasters to ensure the safety of our reporters and interviewees at all times.""
The Parliamentary authorities have issued revised safety advice to MPs planning to take part in media interviews on the green.
Most demonstrators - including the small group of anti-Brexit campaigners who set up their banners and flags outside Parliament every day and the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave group who join them on occasions - are peaceful, although they have had occasional run-ins with the police and each other.
The most dogged of the anti-Brexit protesters, Steve Bray, engages in a daily game of cat and mouse with the broadcasters as he tries to get his slogan in shot.
In recent weeks, however, a more aggressive brand of demonstrators, from the pro-Brexit side, have started showing up to harangue and intimidate certain MPs as they make the short journey from the Commons to the green and back again.
Commons Speaker John Bercow has described them, in a letter to the Metropolitan Police, as a ""regular coterie of burly white men who are effectively targeting and denouncing members whom they recognise and dislike - most notably female and those from ethnic minority backgrounds"".
Journalists, such as the Guardian's Owen Jones, have also been targeted.
Sky News's Kay Burley says she has been interviewed three times by police investigating alleged incidents of abuse amid ""the chaos that is College Green at the moment"".
She told BBC Radio 5 Live she supported the right of people to protest but ""it has become increasingly vile and aggressive and, yes, intimidating as well"", specifically targeting anti-Brexit Conservative MP Anna Soubry, when she was on air.
More than 100 MPs have now called on the Metropolitan Police to do more to protect MPs - the police say they are ready to ""deal robustly"" with any instances of criminal harassment but they have to ""strike a balance"" that allows for protesters to exercise their democratic rights.
A recognisable figure in the group that surrounded Anna Soubry on Monday is online far-right campaigner James Goddard.
He says there can be no peace while Islam exists in the West and that the establishment is riven with paedophiles. He told police outside Parliament they were ""fair game"" and ""if you want a war, we will give you a war"".
Mr Goddard emerged as a DIY far-right campaigner last year as he began to gather followers after campaigning in support of the then-jailed anti-Islam activist, Stephen Lennon aka Tommy Robinson.
Before the incident at Parliament involving Ms Soubry, he'd been helping to organise France-style ""yellow vest"" protests - including attempts to block bridges in London.
Mr Goddard relies on donations from his followers - he frequently runs crowdfunding appeals for his campaigns.
On Tuesday evening, Facebook confirmed it has closed his account.
""We will not tolerate hate speech on Facebook which creates an environment of intimidation and which may provoke real-world violence,"" said a spokesman. Minutes later, his separate Paypal crowdfunding page disappeared too.",Yes
66,67,targeted threat,Doncaster charity DIAL fears for future after thefts,27 August 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-14691895,"A South Yorkshire charity targeted by thieves has said the future delivery of its service is under threat.

The charity said the thefts felt worse because of funding cuts.  The mobile unit has since been recovered, but was ""totally vandalised"".

67,68,targeted threat,China eases some foreign investment rules,28 June 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44639257,"The Chinese government has eased rules that limit foreign investment in the country's banks, car industry and agriculture.
The barriers have drawn criticism from trading partners, including the US.
The Trump administration cited the rules as an example of unfair practices when it announced plans for tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year.
However, this week officials appeared to be trying to defuse the tensions between the two countries.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that his administration did not plan to develop new tools to curb Chinese investment, as he had threatened when the tariffs were announced.
Instead, Mr Trump said he would support a congressional effort to expand the power of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), which vets foreign deals for national security risks.
The legislation, which has support from both US parties and is expected to pass, would expand the kind of deals the committee is instructed to review.
It is a response to concerns in the US that China is stealing its intellectual property, at times through acquisitions of US companies.
However, it does not necessarily target China and is considered a less draconian measure than the president's earlier threat.
""I have concluded that such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security and future economic prosperity,"" Mr Trump said in a statement.
A day after Mr Trump's announcement, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) released a new version of a list outlining industries in which foreign investment is limited or prohibited.
The new list contains 48 industries, compared with 63 on last year's list.
Some of the changes, such as those loosening rules for carmakers, were announced previously.
China's commerce ministry also said it would ""closely monitor"" the US legislation. It also said it objects to the US using national security as an excuse to tighten the rules for Chinese companies in the US.
Chinese investment in the US has already taken a big hit.
The value of deals by Chinese investors fell by more than 90% in 2017, according to the Rhodium Group.
The American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative US think tank, found that China invested $24.2bn across all sectors in the US last year - a huge drop from 2016, but still the second highest on record.
Chinese companies have invested about $21.6bn in US technology businesses since 2007, according to the AEI.
Analysts attribute some of the decline to controls that China has placed on outbound investment. CFIUS also stymied a number of acquisitions.
The US still plans to impose tariffs of 25% on $34bn worth of Chinese goods starting from 6 July, with an additional $16bn potentially to follow.
China has promised matching tariffs in retaliation.
The measures are controversial among businesses, while economists say they pose a risk to economic growth.",Yes

69,70,targeted threat,Canada tow-truck turf wars lead to nearly 200 charges,26 May 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52812811,"Toronto-area police have laid nearly 200 charges, including murder and arson, in relation to a violent turf war in the breakdown lorry industry.
Police allege competition for control of the towing market has resulted in a ""scene of violence"" in the region.
Rival lorry companies were allegedly fighting over not just the profits of towing vehicles, but subsequent insurance frauds.
Police say the turf war was connected to several organised crime groups.
""Their fraudulent billing, fraudulent repairs, [and] fraudulent physiotherapy claims have earned them millions in illicit income,""  said York Regional Police Superintendent Mike Slack said on Tuesday, when announcing the charges. ""And when these profits were not enough they staged collisions using drivers they recruited"".
""As the profits increased, so has the demand for the territory, and the need to control that territory through violence,"" he said.
The region has seen at least 30 arson attacks believed to be connected to the towing industry over the past year, and multiple drivers have been shot at or killed, according to newspaper the Globe and Mail.
The crime spree caught the attention of Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
""We're coming for you, and we're going to catch you. The party's over,"" he said last March.
The investigation, which was dubbed Project Platinum because of the high-end lorries being used by the companies, involved law enforcement from three police agencies and the Canada Revenue Agency.
The public learnt of the turf war last summer, when Toronto Police announced they had arrested seven drivers for gun and drug offences.
But Project Platinum, led by York Regional Police, sheds more light on the inner workings of the industry.
The investigation found that the towing companies worked with complicit auto repair shops, car and truck rental companies, and physiotherapy clinics to defraud insurance companies.
Tow truck companies would hire fake drivers to stage accidents on roads and in parking lots, police claim.
When a group of insurance companies tried to fight the fraudulent claims in court, their law firm, Carr Law, became the target of violence, threats and extortion, according to police.
Police searched locations in several cities and towns in the Greater Toronto Area, including Hamilton, Brantford, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, Markham, Oakville, Toronto and the towns of Aurora and East Gwillimbury.
Twenty people have been arrested and 191 charges brought forth, including one count of first-degree murder, three counts of attempted murder, and multiple counts of fraud, arson and property damage.
Eight of those arrested remain in custody, including Mohamad El-Zahawi, 38, of Toronto, who was just charged with first-degree murder in connection to the death of Soheil Rafipour in 2018.
Mr El-Zahawi's next court appearance is on 21 July.
A first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
Police also seized over 40 firearms, 11 tow trucks, and illegal drugs including cocaine, fentanyl and crystal methamphetamine, worth $1m Canadian dollars (Â£590,000).
""With the accused facing charges and their assets seen, we expect the extreme level of violence we have seen in our community to diminish,"" Superintendent Slack said.
Police expect more arrests to follow in the coming months, and they have called on governments to pass regulations for the towing industries. Currently, only 17 of Ontario's 444 municipalities require towing to be licensed, according to the Globe and Mail.",Yes

It advised British organisations and businesses to review their security measures, although it said the threat was targeted at the embassy itself.
Threats against other UK interests in Kuwait could not be ruled out, it said.
The Foreign Office said services were suspended until after the weekend.
A spokeswoman said all non-essential staff had gone home.
The statement issued by the embassy said: ""There is a general threat from terrorism in Kuwait. Terrorists continue to issue statements threatening to carry out attacks in the Gulf region.""
""These include references to attacks on Western including European interests... residential compounds, military, oil, transport and aviation interests,"" it added.
The embassy is also advising British nationals to exercise caution before sailing in Kuwaiti waters, following what it termed ""maritime restrictions"" issued by Kuwait last month.

71,72,targeted threat,Turkey coup attempt: Gulen's UK followers 'threatened',23 July 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36873532,"Supporters of the man blamed by the Turkish government for last week's attempted coup have told BBC News they have been the target of threats and abuse in the UK.
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Fethullah Gulen of being behind the failed uprising, but he denies any involvement.
Thousands of people suspected of supporting the US-based cleric have been arrested, sacked or suspended from their jobs in Turkey in the past week.
But UK-based Gulenists said that it is not just in Turkey that his followers have been singled out.
Within a few hours of the president urging people to take to the streets in protest last Friday, the Mevlana Rumi mosque in Edmonton, north London said it was targeted.
""Two people entered the mosque. They started shouting out, swearing, breaking the peace,"" said Seval Gokce, the mosque's executive director.
She added: ""A person standing outside opened up the Turkish flag. Then an hour later, five or six more cars pulled up outside the mosque, shouting out abuse and amongst them, they were heard to say they were thinking of burning down the mosque.""
Others have been targeted personally.
Ozcan Keles, a member of the mosque and chairperson of the Gulen-inspired charity Dialogue Society said he and others received threatening text messages.
""It's signed off by 'the angel of death' and then it's got a second signature which says MIT Special Forces and Operations UK,"" he said. ""It's basically saying: I'm sending this on behalf or I am a representative of the Turkish government and Turkish intelligence services.""
He said: ""I'm in London. I have nothing to do with what's happening in Turkey. I condemn the coup as much as anyone condemns it.""
The Gulen movement is not easy to describe.
There is no single identifiable body linking everything together. Instead followers are encouraged to form their own organisations that finance themselves.
But that has led to criticisms that some organisations are too secretive about their connection to the movement.
Bill Park, a senior lecturer in defence studies at King's College, University of London, said: ""They tend to be a bit coy about their links.
""The fact that they are sometimes coy means not only that they arouse suspicion because you never quite know who you're talking to but also it means you can put this label on anyone you don't trust, don't like or feel is up to something.""
As the purge of suspected Gulenists continues in Turkey, it is likely some will be even less keen to identify themselves publicly with the movement.
Seval Gokce said the mosque has reported the incidents to the police and she said the community is being extra vigilant.
""For the first time since 2008, we've put a sign on the door showing our opening and closing hours,"" she said. ""We've only shut down from 11 in the evening until four in the morning but it's the first time we're closing the doors between prayers for our own safety.""",Yes
72,73,targeted threat,"Turkey suspends more than 9,000 police officers over 'Gulen links'",27 April 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39723371,"Turkey's police force has suspended more than 9,000 officers over alleged links to the US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
It said the action had been taken on the grounds of national security.
President Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating a failed coup against him last July - a charge the cleric denies.
Earlier, authorities detained more than 1,000 people in the latest operation against alleged Gulen supporters.
The nationwide sweep was one of the largest such operations carried out in Turkey in months.
As well as the 1,009 detained on Wednesday, arrest warrants were issued for another 3,224 people, as part of a police operation across Turkey's 81 provinces, reports said.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the raids were targeting a Gulenist network ""that infiltrated our police force, called 'secret imams'"".
In the aftermath of the 15 July coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended.
They included soldiers, police, teachers, and public servants - all of whom were accused of having links with militant groups.
The latest purge comes just over a week after President Erdogan narrowly won a controversial referendum on increasing his powers.
Opponents fear the victory, which has bitterly divided Turkey, brings him closer to authoritarian rule.
Two days after the referendum, Turkey's parliament extended a nine-month state of emergency by a further three months.
It was widely expected that the post-coup purge would accelerate once President Erdogan achieved the referendum victory he wanted.
He feels emboldened and there's no longer a risk of jeopardising potential referendum votes.
No matter that the opposition still contests the referendum results, and their claim of widespread fraud is backed by a scathing report from election observers. The president says the result is final.
So on Wednesday the police bore the brunt of the detentions, but other institutions are likely to follow suit.
The governing AKP party was full of Gulen supporters when Mr Erdogan and the cleric were staunch allies.
It hasn't yet been purged and could now be targeted. And even if not, the threat will be dangled over potential opponents like a sword of Damocles: speak out and your Gulen affiliation will be exposed.
The scale of the ""anti-Gulen"" arrests has raised alarm in Europe, and stalled Turkey's bid to join the EU.
After the latest sweep, Germany's foreign ministry said it had ""taken note of the mass detentions with concern"".",Yes
73,74,targeted threat,New Brunswick outbreak: How a smalltown doctor became a Covid pariah,25 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54686672,"After being labelled the ""patient zero"" of an outbreak of Covid, a Congolese-Canadian physician says he became a target for racist threats, a pariah in his community, and a ""scapegoat"" for local officials.
When Dr Jean-Robert Ngola heard that he had to pick up his daughter last May, he quickly did the maths.
His daughter lived in Montreal with her mother, about seven hours away from his home in Campbellton, New Brunswick.
As a family physician, he knew that he needed to be as safe as possible to limit the spread of Covid to others. But as a parent, he had to come get his child so that her mother could attend a family funeral in Africa.
In order to get her and have contact with as few people as possible, he hopped in his car and drove all day, spending the night at his brother's before driving her back.
Before leaving, Dr Ngola called the local police, asking for clarity around the laws about self-isolation.
New Brunswick has one of the strictest quarantine policies in Canada. Along with several other eastern provinces, it has formed an ""Atlantic bubble"" - in the early months of the pandemic, most forms of travel into the bubble were restricted, and anyone entering had to quarantine for 14 days.
But as a frontline worker, he says police told him he was exempt.
Not wanting to leave his patients without a doctor, he decided to go back to work.
On 25 May, Dr Ngola heard that one of his patients had been diagnosed with the virus. He got tested, and began to self-isolate with his four-year-old daughter.
At 11am on 27 May, he learned he, too, had the virus, although he had no symptoms.
Then, his life began to fall apart. Within the hour, his identity began to spread online. Later in the afternoon, Premier Blaine Higgs, who leads the provincial government, was chastising him on live television.
At least two other people had contracted coronavirus ""due to the actions of one irresponsible individual,"" Mr Higgs said, after nearly two weeks without a single case.
Although the premier did not name Dr Ngola directly, by that time, people had connected the dots, and photographs of his office were circulating online.
Provincial health officials told the media Dr Ngola had contracted the disease in the neighbouring province of Quebec, and spread it to others because he did not follow the 14-day mandatory quarantine for people who had been out of New Brunswick.
But Dr Ngola, and his lawyer Joel Etienne, say the rules were not clear, and Dr Ngola was following the same practices as people around him.
They also dispute the province's claim that he was ""patient zero"".
Although no criminal charges were filed, Dr Ngola faces a civil charge for violating the Emergency Measures Act and could face a fine up to C$10,200 ($7,600, Â£6,000). The case is currently making its way before the courts.
His employer, VitalitÃ© Health Network, immediately suspended him without pay for breaking protocols.
""I was the scapegoat. As soon as my diagnosis is madeâ¦ one hour later, my life changed,"" he said.
In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Vitalite confirmed that Dr Ngola's suspension continues, and declined to comment further.
The premier's office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
The reaction from the community was swift and brutal. Dr Ngola, who is originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said people were telling him to ""go back to Africa"" and other forms of racist abuse.
Quarantining in his home with his small daughter, he feared for his safety when his address was leaked online and had to go under police protection. But he was also constantly under police scrutiny, he says, because people kept phoning in with bogus ""tips"" claiming to have seen him break quarantine.
Dr Ngola says the harassment was so bad, he had to leave the province. He was offered a job in a small community in Quebec, where he has been living for the past several months. He says he feels welcome there, but his experience in Campbellton has left psychological scars.
""I cannot have the same life because now I'm public,"" he says.
This is not the first time he's had to start over. Born in the Congo, Dr Ngola had wanted to be a doctor since he was a small child, after coming down with polio and being unable to get the appropriate medical treatment because it was too costly.
""My childhood ambition was to become a doctor in order that children like myself would be spared,"" he says.
He paid his way through school by tutoring other students, and practised medicine during his country's brutal civil war.
In 2000, he immigrated to Belgium, where he had to retrain in order to continue to be a doctor. Then five years later, he relocated to Canada, because he felt he would face less prejudice as an African immigrant. Once again, he went back to school in order to practise medicine.
Now, he feels disillusioned. Dr Ngola says he believes his race and immigration status played a factor in how he was treated not only by the public at large, but by the province's top officials.
""What is the difference with me? The difference is I'm black and I'm a foreigner,"" Dr Ngola said.
Although he felt like a pariah at home, around the country his fellow physicians were rallying to his defence. In September, 1,500 physicians signed a letter condemning his treatment, and demanding an investigation into how his name was leaked to the press.
""All of us signed below have felt tremendous anger, discomfort and frustration with the backlash that followed once you were publicly identified. What unravelled thereafter was unjust, unkind and dehumanizing,"" the letter, which was spearheaded by Dr Danusha Foster, read.
""We strongly believe that systemic racism coupled with the stigma surrounding individuals infected with the Covid-19 virus have significantly contributed to the crucifixion of your character within the public eye.""
Dr Foster, a family physician who lives in Ontario, says that when she first heard about Dr Ngola, she, like many others, judged him.
""We're in a deadly pandemic, and health professionals should be held to a higher standard at this time, because we're supposed to be modelling for the general population what we should be doing,"" she told the BBC.
But after hearing about the abuse he was suffering, and reading media articles critical of the province's investigation, she began to feel sympathy.
""He was being judged in the public eye before the facts were known,"" she says.
She says patient confidentiality is the ""core"" of the doctor-patient relationship, and whoever leaked his name should be held to account.
After talking about his case on online physicians groups, she decided to organise the letter of support, to show Dr Ngola that he wasn't alone.
""I hadn't even written my letter, and I already had 800 names that wanted to sign,"" she says. ""We realised as we watched this case that what happened to Dr Ngola, could have happened to anyone of us... if we made one little mistake.""
Over 40 cases and two deaths have been connected to the outbreak in the Campbellton region since 27 May. But it remains unclear if Mr Ngola was the source.
Anyone entering New Brunswick from another province outside the Atlantic Bubble is supposed to quarantine for 14 days.
But residents of Campbellton, which is on the border of Quebec, were allowed to cross the border without self-isolating for certain reasons, such as if they worked in Quebec, had to attend a medical appointment in Quebec or if they shared custody of a child in Quebec.
According to the provincial guidelines, ""all such workers and individuals who are exempt from self-isolation must travel directly to and from work and/or their accommodations, self-monitor and avoid contact with vulnerable individuals""
Dr Ngola spent about 30 hours in Quebec, including an overnight stay with his brother to rest up after the seven-hour drive. He also saw two colleagues in Trois-Rivieres, although they were masked and socially distanced. He also had contact with a petrol-station employee.
Dr Ngola said many of his co-workers went back and forth to Quebec and did not fully self-isolate, so he did not think he was breaking the rules.
His employer, Vitalite Health, told the CBC's Fifth Estate that all workers were ordered to self-isolate after returning to the province unless they lived in Quebec.
Mr Etienne says regardless of whether his client broke the rules, the province failed to do its due diligence before blaming him for the outbreak.
He says they had not finished contact-tracing the four individuals in Quebec whom Dr Ngola had contact with, before claiming the doctor was the source of the Covid cluster in New Brunswick. He says their own private investigator found that neither his brother, the two colleagues, nor the gas station employee tested positive for Covid.
His daughter, however, did. Both she and her father have made a full recovery.
There had been at least one confirmed case of Covid in Campbellton in the days prior to Dr Ngola's diagnosis, and his lawyer says he could have got it from community spread.",Yes
74,75,targeted threat,Migrant crisis: Germans chide Facebook over race hate,11 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34220796,"A new German Green Party video urges citizens and Facebook managers to act against a spate of anti-immigrant hate messages on social media.
In the four-minute video, the Greens' parliamentary leader, Katrin Goering-Eckardt, read out some anti-immigrant abuse she had received, calling it ""dirt that belongs in the bin"".
She urged Facebook to ""ensure that such hate, such dirt no longer appears on Facebook pages"".
A migrant surge is challenging Germany.
The authorities expect as many as 800,000 migrants - most of them refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - to arrive this year.
The Greens' leader pointed her Facebook readers to the Greens' anti-racism campaign on Twitter, called #NoHateSpeech.
""Your dirt spurs me on,"" she warned those who had insulted her on Facebook.
She said she was also speaking out on behalf of the many Germans helping refugees, who could not defend themselves openly.
Among the personal insults she read out, which she described as ""dirt"", were: ""thick as a sow, you old bag"", ""Yank-loving slut"" and ""you fat dopey rat, you lack a...""
Germany is taking in far more refugees than any other EU country, as the ruling conservative-social democrat coalition says it is a humanitarian duty. The Greens support that policy.
In its ""Community Standards"" section, Facebook says it ""removes hate speech, which includes content that directly attacks people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious disabilities or diseases"".
But Facebook goes on to say that ""as with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this content to us"".
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also called for better Facebook enforcement of the rules against hate speech.
German Interior Minister Heiko Maas is expected to discuss the matter with Facebook executives on Monday.
""The rules need to be implemented,"" Mrs Merkel told the Rheinische Post newspaper.
""When people incite others on social networks, using their real name, not only the state must act, but also Facebook as a company must do something against those slogans,"" she said.
On Twitter, a German Green MP of Turkish origin, Ozcan Mutlu, posted a racist hate message he had received via email, which said ""it's time to get Auschwitz, Buchenwald, etc working again - that's where you filthy Turks belong!""
He said he had asked state prosecutors to take action over it, but they had rejected his request.
Separately, a German district council chairman, Erich Pipa, said he had received a death threat from neo-Nazis, linked to his activism on behalf of migrants.
Mr Pipa, the Social Democrat (SPD) leader in the central German Main-Kinzig district, said Sunday was the day he would be targeted, according to the threat.
But he vowed to attend a local sports event as planned, regardless, the Frankfurter Rundschau reported.
Some other German politicians who actively support the integration of migrants have also been threatened. A car belonging to one - Michael Richter - was blown up in Saxony, eastern Germany, recently.

75,76,targeted threat,UK drone strikes subject to legal challenge by Greens,24 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34339925,"The use of drones to kill UK citizens abroad is being legally challenged by two Green Party parliamentarians.
Earlier this month, David Cameron announced an RAF-operated drone had killed two Britons linked to so-called Islamic State in Syria, describing the action as an ""act of self defence"".
MP Caroline Lucas and Baroness Jones have now sought permission for a judicial review of the policy, claiming that ""targeted killing"" is unlawful.
It is backed by campaigners Reprieve.
Britain is participating in air strikes against IS fighters in Iraq, but not Syria - after the Commons refused to approve the action two years ago.
But in what was the first targeted UK drone attack on a British citizen, Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, and Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen were killed by a remotely piloted aircraft on 21 August in Raqqa, Syria.
Khan, the target of the strike, had been plotting ""barbaric"" attacks on UK soil, the prime minister told MPs in a statement.
He insisted the action was lawful despite Parliament not having authorised airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria.
He said the attorney general had been consulted and agreed there was a ""clear legal basis"" for the strike.
But Ms Lucas and Baroness Jones - the party's sole representatives in Parliament - say there has been a lack of parliamentary scrutiny or approval of the policy and argue there have been conflicting and partial accounts of the justification in statements.
In his statement to MPs on 7 September 2015, David Cameron also said:
In a letter to the Ministry of Defence and the attorney general's office, they argue that the government has either failed to formulate a policy or, if it has a policy, failed to publish it. Either eventuality, they argue, is unlawful.
""If any pre-authorised and targeted killing can be lawful, they must be carried out under a formulated and published Targeted Killing Policy which ensures transparency, clarity and accountability for such use of lethal force,"" the letter says.
The drone strike is expected to be the subject of an investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee of the House of Commons, now chaired by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve.
Reprieve, an international human rights charity, said the government's justification of the strike effectively gave it ""the power to kill anyone, anywhere in the world, without oversight or safeguards"".
""This is a huge step, and at the very least the prime minister should come clean about his new kill policy,"" said its legal director Kat Craig.
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was effectively a ""wholesale adoption"" of the US government's ""so-called targeted killing programme"".
The drone strikes have been backed by Conservative MPs, who said the individuals targeted posed a direct threat to national security.
But Labour has called for the attorney general's advice to be published, something ministers say there is no precedent for.",Yes
76,77,targeted threat,Coronavirus: UK donates Â£20m to speed up vaccine,3 February 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51352952,"The government has donated Â£20 million towards a break-neck plan to produce a vaccine to combat the deadly new coronavirus.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the money would help the UK lead the way in developing a new inoculation.
It comes as the death toll in China increased to 361 with the total number of cases there now above 17,000.
Meanwhile 11 Britons flown back from Wuhan - the outbreak's epicentre - have begun two weeks in quarantine.
The additional evacuees - who travelled from China via France - joined 83 people already in group isolation at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral.
The government's Â£20m investment will go to CEPI - the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations - a global body aiming to fast-track a vaccine within six to eight months.
CEPI chief executive Dr Richard Hatchett said such a tight timescale was ""unprecedented"".
If the biologists are successful, more time would still be required to test the vaccine more widely and secure sign-off from medical regulators before it could be distributed across the world.
""This is an extremely ambitious timeline - indeed, it would be unprecedented in the field of vaccine development,"" Dr Hatchett said.
""It is important to remember that even if we are successful - and there can be no guarantee - there will be further challenges to navigate before we can make vaccines more broadly available.""
The UK's money will help fund the efforts of Dr Kate Broderick, a 42-year-old Scot based in California, who is working to create a coronavirus vaccine.
""We hope to get the final product into human testing by early summer,"" Dr Broderick, a molecular geneticist who works for the pharmaceutical company Inovio, told the BBC last week.

Speaking on her third day in quarantine, she said she had ""some interaction"" with the others in her flat.
""People go [to the lobby] to collect things and also pick up food and some people will stand having their food together, but all wearing masks,"" she said.
""Obviously you have to put your mask down a little for you to eat.""
Announcing the investment into stemming the spread of the virus, Mr Hancock said: ""Vaccines are our best defence against a host of deadly diseases, including coronavirus.
""The UK is a hub of world-leading and pioneering research, and it is vital that we lead the way in developing new vaccines to target global threats with scientists from across the world.""
The death toll from the new virus, which is officially called 2019-nCov, now stands at more than 300.
More than 17,000 cases have been confirmed and a small proportion of those - around 100 - have been identified outside China. The UK, US, Russia and Germany have all confirmed cases in recent days.
Latest figures from China's National Health Commission on Monday showed that there were 21,558 suspected cases in the country and that 152,700 people are ""under medical watch"".

77,78,targeted threat,Lords to debate counter terror bill,13 January 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30790680,"Peers are to debate the government's counter-terrorism bill, which will give new powers to the security services.
The Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill would allow the home secretary to impose temporary exclusion orders on British terror suspects.
There have been calls for ministers to change the proposals to allow judicial oversight of the orders.
In other measures, universities and councils would be required to take steps to counter radicalisation.
The new legislation, which receives its second reading in the House of Lords on Tuesday, also includes:
Under the exclusion orders proposal, Home Secretary Theresa May would be able to sign an order to ban a suspected extremist from returning to the UK, for up to two years at a time.
The individual could return if they agreed to some kind of investigation or monitoring arrangements to ensure they were not a threat.
Labour has called for a judge to have a role when the orders are imposed.
This view was echoed by David Anderson QC, the government's independent reviewer of terror legislation.
He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""If you are going to give these very powerful instruments to the home secretary to decide that she believes someone is a terrorist and they should be constrained in their movements for two years or so, you have absolutely got to have proper judicial safeguards, otherwise you end up fuelling the whole grievance agenda that is at the root of the terrorism in the first place.""
Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said the measures contained in the bill were a ""considered and targeted"" response to the terror threat,
""These important new powers will only be used when it is necessary and proportionate and are subject to stringent safeguards and oversight,"" he added.",Yes

During the summer, the peak time for countryside blazes, it is highlighting the training and advice it offers. Landowners, land managers and mountain rescue teams are being targeted to combat the increased threat. Ethan Bigelow, the group's project officer, described its work as vital. He said: ""Through educating and informing our members we are reducing the risk of blazes breaking out and teaching people about tackling them as quickly and effectively as possible if they do occur."" In May, Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service took delivery of a fleet of eight specially modified Land Rovers, to assist in the battle against wildfires.

81,82,targeted threat,Libya crisis: UN presents 'unity' plan to factions,9 June 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33059028,"The UN has presented a draft proposal for a Libyan unity government to warring factions in an attempt to stabilise the conflict-torn country.
The plan unveiled at talks in Morocco addresses terms of a truce and disarmament of armed groups.
UN special envoy Bernardino Leon urged the Libyans to back the proposal.
Since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has descended into chaos and seen jihadist groups fighting for control of the oil-rich nation.
Islamic State (IS) militants have recently managed to gain a foothold in Libya's cities of Derna and Sirte.
On Tuesday, the militants said they had seized a power plant near Sirte, which a military source confirmed, Reuters news agency reports.
According to the privately owned Libyan al-Wasat newspaper, the insurgents took the facility after a militia linked to the authorities in Tripoli withdrew.
The BBC's North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad says with the gradual spread of IS, most of Libya's warring militias are now facing a common threat that did not exist when they declared war on each other.
This may prove to be the one element that forces them to work together, she adds.
Analysis: BBC North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad, Tunis
This latest draft will be attractive to Libya's political rivals, but is unlikely to please the country's warlords. The threat of targeted UN sanctions on individuals may help to get agreement.
Key to implementing large parts of the agreement appears to be the creation of a legitimate armed force, which will be a long and difficult process.
The delegates taking part in the current dialogue will oversee the deal's implementation and have some short-term decision-making powers.
If adopted, it could put Libya back on track if all militias fall into line - or spark a wider conflict if the militias oppose disarmament. And as has happened in recent years, new militia alliances could take shape.
""Today, the people of Libya have their eyes on this gathering, on you, in the hope that you'll save your country and your people from protracted conflict,"" Mr Leon told Libya's two rival governments at the talks in Skhirat.
""I am full of hope that this draft represents a fair and reasonable way forward.""
The UN plan calls for a one-year-long national unity government and says that the parliament elected in 2014 is the only legislative body.
However, it says a High Council of State should be formed with 120 members - many of them from the rival parliament - to be Libya's ""highest consultative body"" with ""binding opinions"".
A council, made up of the prime minister and four other politicians, has also been proposed to be in control the armed forces.
Libya's rival power bases
Why is Libya so lawless?
Islamic State gains Libya foothold
Currently, Libya's internationally recognised parliament is based in the eastern port of Tobruk.
Its rival, the Islamist-dominated General National Congress, is nearly 1,000km (620 miles) to the west in the capital, Tripoli.
Representatives of both groups - who have made no public comments on the UN proposal - are expected to reconvene for talks later this week.
""What I can say is at the end of this week, we will have a very clear idea on who is for peace who is not, and that will help us to focus our efforts in the future,"" the US ambassador to Libya, Deborah Jones, was quoted as saying by Reuters.",Yes
82,83,targeted threat,'Cruel' Super Bowl and schools' bomb hoaxer jailed,2 December 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-50613841,"A computer enthusiast who made 107 hoax bomb threats to targets including schools, the Palace of Westminster and the Super Bowl, has been jailed.
Andreas Dowling from Torpoint, Cornwall admitted 30 counts of communicating false information with intent.
He was sentenced at Exeter Crown Court to four years and five months.
Judge Mrs Justice May said the 24-year-old's actions were ""pernicious and nasty"" and calls targeting Jewish schools were racially motivated.
Dowling made threats to about 70 schools in the UK, affecting more than 44,000 pupils, and various locations in the US and Canada.
He was fascinated by computers from the age of six and studied network and software development at Cornwall College. The court was told he also had a good knowledge of security systems.
His motivations varied and included racism, punishing the US Government for perceived corruption, and closing schools for pupils in return for payment, the court heard.
He lived with his mother and used software to disguise his voice.
In 2015 he made repeated bomb threats to the Super Bowl in Arizona but the event went ahead.
The following year he targeted the Palace of Westminster - his only non-education target in the UK - saying a bomb was attached to a parked vehicle and there was 30 minutes to evacuate, but it was correctly identified as a hoax.
The court heard Jewish schools were ""over-represented"" as targets in the UK-based hoaxes and were selected ""based on racial or religious identity of the students"".
The prosecution said threats to the Jewish schools referred to bombs going off at ""4.20pm"", which was a reference to Adolf Hitler's birthday of April 20.
Sentencing, Mrs Justice May said: ""One has only to imagine the extreme anxiety head teachers must have felt receiving news of a bomb threat and how pernicious and cruel it was to make those calls"".",Yes
83,84,targeted threat,Ilhan Omar condemns 'anti-Muslim' poster at Republican event,4 March 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47433419,"US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has condemned a poster linking her to the 9/11 attacks displayed at a Republican stall in the West Virginia legislature.
She said the ""anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist"" encouraged threats of violence against her.
West Virginia Republicans said they did not support hate speech and had told the exhibitor to remove the poster.
Ms Omar was elected last November, one of the first two Muslim women to have been elected to the US Congress.
The poster at Friday's West Virginia Republican Day in the state legislature in the town of Charleston showed her and the burning twin towers in New York alongside the words: ""Never forget - you said. I am the proof - you have forgotten.""
In response Ms Omar said the image showed why she was the target of threats.
""No wonder I am on the 'hitlist' of a domestic terrorist and 'Assassinate Ilhan Omar' is written on my local gas stations,"" she said.
""Look no further, the GOP's [Republican] anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist rocks in state capitols and no one is condemning them.""
Ms Omar's mention of a hitlist appears to refer to an alleged plot by a self-proclaimed white nationalist. Christopher Paul Hasson had a cache of weapons and a list of targets including Ms Omar and other prominent Democratic politicians.
The poster of Ms Omar was next to a poster for ACT for America, West Virginia Public Broadcasting reported.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a rights group, lists ACT for America as ""an anti-Muslim hate group"".
However, ACT said in a statement that it had nothing to do with the poster of Ms Omar and had a ""zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination"".
West Virginia House of Delegates member Anne Lieberman later resigned after she was accused in the House of making an Islamophobic remark.
Democratic Delegate Michael Angelucci said that during the row over the poster Anne Lieberman said all Muslims were terrorists.
Ms Lieberman declined to comment when contacted by AP news agency.
Last month Ms Omar apologised for tweets implying US lawmakers only supported Israel because of lobby money.
""Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,"" she said.",Yes
84,85,targeted threat,Russia says Syrian 'chemical attack' was staged,13 April 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43747922,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said a reported chemical attack in Syria was staged by foreign agents.
A spokesman for Russia's defence ministry accused the UK of being involved in staging the attack.
The US and France say they have proof it took place and, alongside the UK, are considering military retaliation.
Russia, which has military forces deployed in Syria in support of the government, has warned that Western air strikes risk starting a war.
During a press briefing on Friday, Mr Lavrov said he had ""irrefutable evidence"" that the attack was staged as part of a ""Russophobic campaign"" led by one country, which he did not name.
General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's defence ministry, said: ""We have... evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in  organising this provocation.""
The UK's envoy to the UN has called this a ""grotesque, blatant lie"", Reuters news agency reports.
The White House says it is continuing to assess intelligence and talk to its allies about how to respond.
Meanwhile the UN's secretary general has said the Middle East is ""in chaos"" and the Cold War is ""back with a vengeance"".
Antonio Guterres was speaking to a special meeting of the UN Security Council, called by Russia.
He urged countries to ""act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances"".
A delegation from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will arrive in Syria's Eastern Ghouta region on Saturday. Few details are expected to be released about the movements of the chemical weapons inspectors, for safety reasons.
The suspected attack, denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, was carried out in the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma on Saturday, reportedly killing dozens of people.
Control over the town has since passed from rebels to the Syrian and Russian military authorities.
The Violations Documentation Center (VDC), a Syrian opposition network which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, said bodies were found foaming at the mouth, and with discoloured skin and cornea burns.
On Thursday, unnamed US officials told NBC News they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent.
The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, told the network: ""We definitely have enough proof but now we just have to be thoughtful in our action.""
French President Emmanuel Macron also said he had ""proof"" that the Syrian government had attacked Douma with chemical weapons but did not give further details.
A UN report last year found the Syrian government responsible for a deadly chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, in which more than 80 people died.
That attack was followed by a US cruise missile attack on a Syrian airbase.
In the UK, cabinet ministers agreed it was ""highly likely"" the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for the alleged attack and said the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"".
During a phone call on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump had agreed to ""keep working closely"" on the issue, Mrs May's office said.
The US president has said Russian President Vladimir Putin bears responsibility for the alleged attack in Douma because of his support for the Syrian government.
On Wednesday he warned Russia that missiles were ""coming"" but later tweeted that he had ""never said when"". It ""could be very soon or not so soon at all"", Mr Trump said.
Russia has described the reports of a chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention.
Moscow's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Washington of putting international peace at risk.
""The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,""  he said on Thursday.
Senior Russian figures, including the head of the military, have warned that US missiles will be shot down and their launch sites targeted if Russian personnel come under threat.
On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich criticised Mr Trump's rhetoric.
""We cannot depend on the mood of someone on the other side of the ocean when he wakes up,"" the Tass news agency quoted him as saying.
After six weeks of heavy fighting and an estimated 1,700 civilian deaths in the Eastern Ghouta, rebels are now leaving the area.
The final evacuations of about 4,000 remaining Islamist fighters and civilians were taking place on Friday, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring organisation.",Yes

Arshad, of Heatherslaw Road, Fenham, admitted one bomb hoax charge at Newcastle Crown Court.
His video also featured commentary referencing previous terrorist attacks in the UK and abroad, police said.
Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden, head of the North East counter terrorism unit, said: ""Arshad created, uploaded and shared a video online showing what he knew to be a non-viable explosive device, suggesting its potential to cause harm, knowing he was deliberately misleading anyone who saw it.
""The purpose of his actions was to cause fear and alarm.

Neo-Nazi propaganda and firearms were seized in the raids, in 10 of Germany's 16 states.
The targeted group, ""United German Peoples and Tribes"", is part of ReichsbÃ¼rger, whose members reject the German state as a legal entity.
The interior ministry said racism ""even in times of crisis"" would be combated.
The statement from ministry spokesman Steve Alter was a reference to the coronavirus pandemic, which has triggered the closure of German schools, businesses and public events.
The ReichsbÃ¼rger movement is estimated to have 19,000 members in Germany. Those targeted are suspected of spreading racist threats and propaganda.
It is the first time the interior minister has banned a group associated with the ReichsbÃ¼rger movement.
Last month a gunman linked by the authorities to far-right conspiracy theories murdered nine people of foreign heritage in the western town of Hanau.
In October 2017 a ReichsbÃ¼rger member was sentenced to life imprisonment in Bavaria for killing a policeman during a raid on his home in 2016.
Thursday's raids were the latest big move against far-right groups this year. The authorities have also put part of the far-right political party Alternative for Germany (AfD) under systematic surveillance and banned the neo-Nazi group Combat 18.
ReichsbÃ¼rger members do not recognise the post-war German federal republic, seeing it merely as some sort of private company.

Antonio Guterres also warned about the dangers of escalation over Syria.
The US and its allies are considering launching missile strikes against Syria after a suspected chemical attack, an action which Russia - whose forces are there supporting the government- has said would risk starting a war.
Russia has accused the UK of faking an attack, an allegation Britain dismissed as a ""grotesque, blatant lie"".
The Cold War, which followed the Allied victory in World War Two, saw the US and its allies facing off for decades with the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state.
Mr Guterres delivered his warnings at the opening of a bad-tempered UN Security Council meeting.
""The Cold War is back with a vengeance, but with a difference,"" he said. ""The mechanisms and the safeguards to manage the risks of escalation that existed in the past no longer seem to be present.""
He urged countries to ""act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances"".
During the meeting:
The US and France have both said they have proof the Syrian government attacked the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma last Saturday, but neither country has officially given further details.
On Friday, US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: ""We know for a fact that it was a chemical weapon.""
When she was asked whether the US had proof the Syrian government was behind the attack, she said: ""Yes.""
The suspected attack, in which dozens of people reportedly died, was denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.
Rescue workers from the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society, which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas, said victims were found with foam coming out of their mouths, blue skin and lips, and corneal burns.

In a video produced by the Russian defence ministry two men speaking Arabic say they were working in the casualty ward of Douma's central hospital when they assisted people brought in after the bombing of a multi-storey building.
While they are clearly talking about the suspected chemical attack, both say the bombing occurred on Sunday 8 April when it actually occurred on Saturday 7 April.
The two men say people were suffering from smoke inhalation, not chemical poisoning, but a panic began when one man said they were victims of a chemical attack.
""This is grotesque, it is a blatant lie, it is some of the worst pieces of fake news we've yet seen from the Russia propaganda machine,"" the UK's UN ambassador, Karen Pierce said.

88,89,targeted threat,ISPs take legal action against GCHQ,2 July 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28106815,"Seven internet service providers have filed a legal complaint against the UK's intelligence agency GCHQ.
ISPs from the US, UK, Netherlands and South Korea have joined forces with campaigners Privacy International to take the agency to task over alleged attacks on network infrastructure.
It is the first time that GCHQ has faced such action.
The move follows allegations about government snooping made by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The ISPs claim that alleged network attacks, outlined in a series of articles in Der Spiegel and the Intercept, were illegal and ""undermine the goodwill the organisations rely on"".
The allegations that the legal actions are based on include:
While the ISPs taking the action were not directly named in the leaked Snowden documents, Privacy International claims that ""the type of surveillance being carried out allows them to challenge the practices... because they and their users are at threat of being targeted"".
Privacy International has previously filed two other cases - the first against alleged mass surveillance programmes Tempora, Prism and Upstream, and the second against the deployment by GCHQ of computer intrusion capabilities and spyware.
Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said ""These widespread attacks on providers and collectives undermine the trust we all place on the internet and greatly endangers the world's most powerful tool for democracy and free expression.""
The ISPs involved in the action are UK-based GreenNet, Riseup (US), Greenhost (Netherlands), Mango (Zimbabwe), Jinbonet (South Korea), May First/People Link (US)and the Chaos Computer Club (Germany).
Cedric Knight, of ISP GreenNet, added: ""Snowden's revelations have exposed GCHQ's view that independent operators like GreenNet are legitimate targets for internet surveillance, so we could be unknowingly used to collect data on our users.

The Royal Navy described the targeting of the crew as ""extremely reckless and irresponsible behaviour"".
The aircraft, from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, was called to the rescue operation in Saltcoats at about 22:00.

Right-wing Senator Giuseppe Moles of Forza Italia spoke out publicly, warning the minister that credibility was like virginity and ""easy to lose"".
Furious senators in her Five Star party demanded that Mr Moles apologise.
A deputy health minister and a regional governor also have police guards now.
The deputy minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, had received threats linked to coronavirus aid. Like Ms Azzolina, he is in the  anti-establishment Five Star movement, part of Italy's coalition government.
Attilio Fontana, governor of the Lombardy region - epicentre of Italy's coronavirus crisis - was also assigned police protection after being threatened on social media. Graffiti in Milan labelled him a ""murderer"".
He is in Matteo Salvini's anti-immigration League, and his Lombardy government has been heavily criticised for shortcomings in its crisis response, such as shortages of some medical kit in the severely stretched health service.
Austria's Justice Minister Alma Zadic, a Green politician, was reported to be under police protection in January after being targeted by far-right threats on social media.
During question time in the Senate on Thursday Senator Moles unleashed a tirade against Ms Azzolina, 37, who is battling to address widespread frustration over the paralysis in education caused by the coronavirus crisis.
""We've heard so much: school closing yes, school closing no; in April all students will be promoted, in May some students will fail; in September lessons can be half at school, half at home,"" he said.
""I remind you minister that school requires credibility and seriousness. And credibility is like virginity: easy to lose, difficult to maintain, and impossible to recover.""
Ms Azzolina did not hit back at the senator - her social media posts have focused on her plans to get Italy's students back into class, while ensuring that protection against coronavirus is in place. Unlike some other countries, Italy is delaying the reopening of schools until September.
Colleagues sprang to the minister's defence. Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia called on Mr Moles to apologise. His comment comparing credibility to virginity was even more serious, she said, because it had been made ""in front of a woman, a minister, who has in recent days suffered every kind of attack and insult"" which meant she needed police protection.
A decree for schools has been adopted by the Senate - the upper house of parliament - including a host of new hygiene rules drafted by a scientific expert panel.
There will be a one-metre social distancing rule in classrooms, compulsory masks for those aged over six and staggering of school timetables to keep student numbers down. Anyone with a temperature of 37.5C will have to stay at home.
Among those who attacked Ms Azzolina on social media was Vittorio De PrÃ , a maths teacher at a secondary school in Ovada, a small town in Piedmont, northern Italy. He now faces possible suspension for sexist abuse, the daily La Stampa reports.
He apologised, saying: ""shut up at home for some time, exasperated by this situation, I let myself go and wrote what everyone has read and rightly condemned.
""I was anxious because nothing was known about the state exams for high school and there was talk of teachers having to be present for the tests. I also have health problems. So I did a stupid thing. I can only apologise to the minister.""
Senator Moles also apologised, insisting that he was referring to the credibility of school and he was not being sexist.",Yes
93,94,targeted threat,Ticket scams 'cost victims Â£3.7m' last year,15 May 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27419369,"Concert goers and holidaymakers were the biggest victims of ticket scammers last year, police have said.
The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said unsuspecting consumers handed over a total of Â£3.7m to fraudsters in 2013.
Among the 4,555 reports were 22 victims who lost Â£10,000 or more.
Almost half the cases involved flight or concert and festival tickets, although people buying tickets for sporting events were also targeted.
Fraud reports peaked in the summer music festival season, Acpo said, and spiked for flight tickets again in December.
The association said scams were typically carried out over the internet.
Acpo's national co-ordinator for economic crime, Commander Stephen Head, said the problem was getting worse.
""Millions of pounds were lost last year and millions more could go the same way in 2014,"" he warned.
""Taking a punt on an unofficial seller, be it over the internet or face-to-face, is just not worth the risk.""
Cdr Head, of the City of London Police, said the responsibility for tackling the con artists lay with ticket distributors, as well as the police:
""I am calling on the industry to take a long hard look at the way tickets are sometimes sold in this country to ensure their processes are as resilient as they possibly can be to the growing threat of fraud.""
Acpo pointed to research by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau which suggested fraudsters prepare for summer music festivals through the autumn and winter months.
It said a common method used by scammers was to claim the cost of flights had risen and demand more money.
If the buyer tried to cancel, a ""cancellation"" fee would be added, even though in many cases no flights had ever been booked by the fraudsters, Acpo said.
In the festival season fraudsters would typically produce a certificate of authentication to persuade music fans to hand over their money.

94,95,targeted threat,Q&A: Northern Ireland flag protests,28 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20651163,"At the end of 2012 and throughout 2013, loyalist protests took place across Northern Ireland over the decision to fly the union flag at Belfast City Hall only on designated days.
Dozens of police officers were injured and scores of people arrested.
The protests also saw the middle-ground Alliance Party targeted, including a death threat against East Belfast MP Naomi Long and councillors' homes attacked in Bangor and Newtownards.
On Monday 3 December, 2012, Belfast City Council voted to fly the union flag at city hall only on designated days.
Nationalists at Belfast City Council had wanted the union flag taken down altogether, but in the end voted on a compromise from the Alliance Party that it would fly on designated days.
Unionists said they considered the changes to be an attack on their cultural identity.
A loyalist protest outside the building erupted into violence minutes after the motion was passed. Disorder also broke out in east Belfast.
Fifteen police officers were injured, as well as a press photographer and two security guards.
Police were criticised by Sinn FÃ©in for not anticipating the violence.
Council staff removed the flag at 07:00 GMT on Tuesday. It is now only flown on 18 designated days.
Parades and flags are important symbols to loyalists, who describe them as expressions of their culture.
The decision at Belfast City Hall followed a difficult, but not explosive, marching season during which there were numerous arguments and disturbances over specific parades.
Many loyalists claimed that some nationalists were trying to erase their identity from Northern Ireland.
The unionists argued that the flag had flown for decades above Belfast City Hall and the other parties should have left it alone.
Former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Matt Baggott told a press conference on 7 January 2013, after four successive nights of disorder in east Belfast: ""I am concerned that senior members of the UVF in east Belfast -  as individuals - have been increasingly orchestrating some of this violence.
""That is utterly unacceptable and is being done for their own selfish motives. There is no excuse whatsoever for violence, as we've said, and we will be investigating that and taking the appropriate action.""
Previously, assistant chief constable Will Kerr had said members of both the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had been involved in violence around flag protests and that ""we're now seeing senior members actively involved in orchestrating the violence.""
In the weeks before the city hall vote, up to 40,000 leaflets criticising Alliance were distributed in a joint operation carried out by Democratic Unionist Party and Ulster Unionist Party activists.
Alliance accused the unionists of a blatant attempt to ramp up tensions over the union flag issue.
Unionists insisted their defence of the flag was a matter of principle and they wanted peaceful, constructive protests.
However, with the involvement of loyalist elements, and others using social media, the protests took on a life of their own, spreading well beyond central Belfast.
Protests followed in towns such as Carrickfergus, Coleraine and Ballymena.
Roads were also blocked in parts of Northern Ireland.
The Alliance Party was the target of threats and violence. East Belfast MP Naomi Long was threatened as was councillor Laura McNamee.
An Alliance Party office was destroyed in Carrickfergus and councillors' homes attacked in Bangor and Carrickfergus.
Alliance holds the balance of power on Belfast City Council, and could have voted down the original motion to remove the flag on all days.
Instead it came up with a compromise, suggesting that the union flag should be flown only on designated days.
Many of the party's offices are in unionist and loyalist areas and towns, like Carrickfergus and Bangor and so are an easier target than those of other parties, although two Sinn FÃ©in representatives were also threatened.",Yes

96,97,targeted threat,Rural crime: Cost in England and Wales 'reaches more than Â£800m',15 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34250455,"Crime in rural parts of England and Wales cost more than Â£800m last year, a survey of 17,000 people suggests.
The National Rural Crime Network (NRCN) said its poll found the average cost to victims was Â£2,500 for rural households and Â£4,000 for businesses.
These crimes, which include theft of tractors and livestock, cost 21 times more than previous estimates, it said.
The Home Office said crime had fallen by 25% since 2010, with rural areas less likely to be affected than towns.
The NRCN, which was formed by police and crime commissioners to highlight crime in rural areas, said the estimated figure of Â£800m was based on the average cost of crimes reported in its survey, multiplied by the total number of crimes in rural areas reported from May 2014 to April 2015.
It also took into account the fact its survey suggested that 27% of crimes were not reported in rural areas.
The insurance company NFU Mutual had previously estimated the cost of rural crime in the UK to be Â£37.8m in 2014.
Julia Mulligan, chair of the NRCN and police and crime commissioner for North Yorkshire, said: ""Some of the findings in this report make uncomfortable reading but it is vitally important for the reality of rural crime to be fully acknowledged and acted upon.
""Its actual scale is clearly much greater than we had previously known; Â£800m is a big number. The low satisfaction rates also need to be a wake-up call for police forces in rural areas and everything should be done to harness the opportunities presented.""
The survey found 39% of people in rural areas rated the police as good or excellent compared with 63% across England and Wales.
It found the two greatest concerns to the rural community were road safety (63%) and fly-tipping (61%).
Among seven recommendations made, the NRCN said there needed to be a review of the funding formula for police resources in the countryside.
The NRCN said policing for sparsely populated areas was ""relatively expensive on a per capita basis"", which meant resources were under ""even greater pressure"".
In July the government announced it would launch a consultation on reforming the Police Allocation Formula, which uses data including population density to determine how much police forces receive.
The NRCN said that police, government and other authorities should work together better. It also called for police resources to be better targeted to ""ensure the assessment of threat, risk and harm is as applicable to rural communities as urban"".
A Home Office spokesman said police and crime commissioners (PCCs) have a ""strong voice in determining how police resources are allocated to tackle the crimes that matter most to them"".
They added: ""This government welcomes the work the National Rural Crime Network is leading to ensure police forces respond to crime in rural areas with the same dedication as crime in urban areas. We trust reports like this will help PCCs hold their forces to account for the services they offer.""
The Home Office highlighted the Crime Survey for England and Wales and the Commercial Victimisation Survey which both suggested crime rates in the countryside were lower than in urban areas.",Yes
97,98,targeted threat,Why Seychelles has world's worst heroin problem,21 November 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-50488877,"The island paradise of Seychelles is suffering from a drug epidemic of huge proportions.
Known for its coral reefs, mangroves and white sandy beaches, 360,000 tourists travel to the Indian Ocean archipelago each year for a holiday of a lifetime.
But look beyond the private islands, the boutique resorts and high-end restaurants, and the small nation is battling a heroin epidemic of huge proportions.
Between 5,000 and 6,000 people out of a total population of 94,000 - the equivalent of nearly 10% of the working population - are addicted to heroin, according to the Agency for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation (APDAR) in the Seychelles.
Per capita, the Seychelles suffers from the highest rate of heroin abuse in the world.
Jed Lesperance was 20 years old when he first started taking drugs. He is 34 now.
""I started smoking cannabis with my friends every now and again. At first it was fun,"" he said.
""But over time I graduated to heroin and it started taking over my life. I was smoking heroin two to three times a day, even stealing from my grandmother to pay for my habit. Within a few weeks, I had become addicted,"" he said.
Heroin makes the long journey from Central Asia, especially Afghanistan, before being smuggled to the islands via East Africa.
Made up of 115 islands, the Seychelles has many porous borders, which makes them hard to monitor and easy for drugs to come into the country.
But rather than attempting a ""war on drugs"", which would criminalise the large proportion of heroin users in the Seychelles, the head of the anti-drug agency has introduced a Portuguese-style drug policy - considering drug addiction as a chronic disease to be treated.
""The Agency for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation was established in August 2017 and we introduced the Methadone Maintenance Programme (MMP) in May 2018,"" Patrick Herminie told the BBC.
Heroin users have two options:
Individuals have access to medical and psychosocial support under both programmes.
""Currently, we have over 2,000 people registered in one of our programmes and 68% of those are now gainfully employed,"" Mr Herminie said.
Mr Lesperance is one of those people who has benefitted from joining a rehabilitation programme set up by the agency.
Each morning, he visits one of the country's roaming methadone clinics - white vans that are manned by drug counsellors and qualified nurses to give the correct dose of methadone to recovering addicts.
Dozens of people line up outside the open windows of the white van ready to show their ID. Their name, the date and time are logged into a spreadsheet and on receipt of the information, the correct dose of methadone is distributed to them.
Mr Lesperance, who has been clean for three months, now works as a pastry chef in a five-star hotel on Mahe, the largest island in the Seychelles.
""Since I found work, I have a lot more stability and it has encouraged me to stay on the programme.
""I have also been able to give some of the money I earn back to my grandmother, which has made our relationship a lot better,"" he said.
Michelle Sabury, who helps recruit drug addicts on to rehabilitation programmes, agrees that ""he is a completely different person"".
""When he first came to us, he was underweight and had very little hope. Now he looks a lot healthier and is able to go to work each day. We are proud of what he has achieved,"" she told the BBC.
After receiving methadone, many of those enrolled in the programme stay to talk with their peers or a counsellor before heading off to work or back home.
Some arrive with family members in tow, illustrating how the stigma attached to treatment in the Seychelles is slowly disintegrating.
One of the counsellors, Levina Mosses, is a reformed heroin addict who now comes to offer support to others hoping to get clean.
""I started talking heroin when I was 17 years old. My boyfriend was a dealer at the time, so I never had to pay for drugs.
""But after years of heroin abuse, I had had enough. My only option was to get clean.""
Ms Mosses left her boyfriend, also the father of her children, 11 years ago - and has been clean ever since.
""I think it's important to get support from people who have been in similar situations so they can see what it is like to come out of it on the other [side].
""The heroin epidemic has touched so many people in my country, it's only right to be open and honest about the problems we are facing,"" she said.
Following the rollout of the rehabilitation programmes, the price of heroin in the Seychelles has plummeted.
""A line of heroin - around 0.1g - used to cost around 1,000 rupee [$73; Â£57] but now it can be bought for around 30 rupee,"" said the anti-drug agency head.
""The main aim [is] to undermine all of the work that we have done in rehabilitating the population and get people using again, but we are determined to keep up the fight,"" he said.
However, there is another threat mounting in the Seychelles as the popularity of synthetic drugs is now on the rise.
""We don't have any official numbers as yet but anecdotally, we have heard that dealers are starting [to] get their hands on new drugs, drugs that we cannot treat with methadone,"" Mr Herminie said.
""But we hope that the agency will be able to adapt quickly and target new threats that come our way.""",Yes
98,99,targeted threat,'Scam baiters' get a kick out of conning the con artists,8 June 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39884625,"Every year tens of thousands of people are conned by online scammers, but it is not only the authorities taking action: a network of tech-savvy volunteers is also working to expose them.
""We waste scammers' time, we waste their resources and we make them believe they are not as good as they think they are,"" Jill - not her real name - explains to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
She is part of a global network of so-called scam baiters, who spend their evenings trying to unearth online con artists by pretending to fall for their tricks.
The ruses can range from emails saying the recipients have won the lottery, to ""long-lost relatives"" who have left them an inheritance.
""Scammers are always going to be there but if we can take them down a peg and take a victim away from them any time we can, then we are doing something good,"" Jill adds.
One of the main techniques, explains Wayne - a scam baiter who often works with Jill - is by leaking scammers' details and their conversation scripts online.
The aim is for these to filter through to search-engine results, so potential victims will be alerted if they type in the scammer's name.
Wayne says police and other authorities use the data, too.
The scam baiters say they do not earn a penny from their work and that they have other reasons for taking on the con artists.
One man from the US, who wished to remain anonymous, wanted to turn the tables after his mother was caught up in a ""grandparent scam"", and came close to losing $5,000 (Â£3,900).
For Wayne, the motivation is simply the ""buzz"" he receives from knowing he can help someone.
He says people have contacted him via his website on the verge of suicide.
Questions remain, however, over whether scam baiters are sufficiently equipped - or best placed - to deal with scammers rather than the authorities.
Official advice is to report any suspected offenders to Action Fraud - the UK's national fraud and cyber-crime centre, which focuses much of its resources on prevention and raising awareness.
And Wayne says scam baiters do point people towards the official routes when they feel out of their depth.
But Jill argues they still play an important role, as advances in technology and the fact many of the scammers are overseas mean it is difficult for authorities to catch such criminals.
And they reject the label vigilante. ""Vigilantes work outside the law,"" says Wayne.
Wayne's set-up is rudimentary. He works under various aliases, mostly named after characters from his favourite children's television shows of his youth.
He often makes himself seem more vulnerable - and potentially gullible - by pretending to have recently broken up from a partner.
""To bait you do need to have something of a twisted sense of humour,"" he jokes.
Both Wayne and Jill always wait to be approached by scammers, rather than seeking them out.
But they don't have to wait long. Their names are on a so-called ""suckers list"" - effectively a database of people thought to be easy to con - which is passed around by scammers online.
The latest to get in touch is a man who emails Jill to say she has won the lottery in Africa.
Pretending to be husband and wife, Wayne and Jill make a joint call back, the aim being to waste the scammer's time by arguing about which one of them gets the money.
They often have other scam baiters on stand-by who can be brought in to play other characters in their facade, to confuse the scammer - and waste their time - for as long as they wish.
Surprisingly, Jill considers her biggest success to be the time she received a death threat from a scammer she had targeted.
""If you get a death threat you know you've really wound someone up. I had one scammer driving round Madrid for a day trying to find 'Lynn', who had gone to Madrid.
""Of course, I hadn't gone to Madrid, I was in my front room. He got so upset and said, 'I'm going to come and find you. I don't care what the penalty for murder is in the UK, I'm going to find you'.""
Jill tells it as a funny anecdote, but it underlines the dangers involved.
""I take great care in protecting my online persona,"" she says.
""I bait with email addresses that aren't traceable. I don't use any of my real-life information. All of my characters are based somewhere 100 miles away from where I live.""
Asked whether the death threat suggested scam baiters were taking their cause too far, she firmly disagrees.
""None of us are taking this far enough. These people are criminals. They don't deserve our sympathy.
""They rob our elderly relatives, so they deserve to be treated as criminals. If we could get them arrested, we would.""

99,100,targeted threat,Biden sets out $2tn plan for carbon-free electricity by 2035,14 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53411506,"Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden has set out an ambitious $2tn (Â£1.6tn) green energy plan to create carbon-free electricity by 2035.
The proposal to reduce emissions in the US would see investment in clean energy infrastructure over a four-year period.
""Let's not waste any more time,"" Mr Biden said at a campaign event in his home state of Delaware on Tuesday, adding: ""Let's get to work, now.""
His focus on climate issues is in contrast with President Donald Trump.
Mr Trump has previously called climate change ""mythical"" and ""an expensive hoax"", but also subsequently described it as a ""serious subject"".
""When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax,"" Mr Biden said at the Build Back Better campaign event in Wilmington. ""When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs.""
The former vice-president added: ""We're not just going to tinker around the edges.""
Mr Biden's campaign staff said they would provide details of how the plan to ""produce power without producing carbon pollution"" would work and how it could be funded in the coming weeks.
The Democratic presidential candidate has previously pledged to raise taxes on large corporations and reverse Mr Trump's tax cuts for high earners.
Mr Biden also said he would re-join the Paris climate agreement, which Mr Trump withdrew the US from in 2017.
As election day approaches and his polling lead holds firm, Joe Biden is getting more ambitious with his proposed first-term presidential agenda.
The latest move, addressing the threat of climate change, targets a top issue for many in the liberal grass roots of the Democratic Party.
The former vice-president's original proposal, unveiled last year, included spending $1.7tn on infrastructure and green jobs over 10 years. It was largely rejected by environmental activists as too little, too slowly.
His latest plan, $2tn over four years, is getting a much more enthusiastic reception, including from groups like the Sunrise Movement, which endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries and have viewed Mr Biden with scepticism.
At the very least, Mr Biden's announcement could help shore up his political left flank as he prepares to face off against Donald Trump in November.
Conservatives have been quick to condemn the plan as big-government profligacy, but the scope of Mr Biden's proposal could reflect rapidly shifting views on what is possible in a political world reshaped by the coronavirus.
Massive government spending and trillion-dollar budget deficits are already a reality. Mr Biden's goal, with his big-ticket climate-change proposal, is to keep the fiscal ball rolling toward his party's priorities.
Responding to Mr Biden's proposal, Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley said it read ""like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class"".
""There is no way he can sell this radical agenda to union workers in energy-producing, manufacturing, or auto industry states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, or Wisconsin,"" Mr Gidley added.
The economy is expected to be a key theme of the 2020 US presidential election, which is due to be held on 3 November.
It will take place following the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has pushed tens of millions of Americans into unemployment.",Yes
100,1,Advanced Persistent Threat,UK military fears robots learning war from video games,23 May 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44217246,"Robots that train themselves in battle tactics by playing video games could be used to mount cyber-attacks, the UK military fears.
The warning is in a Ministry of Defence report on artificial intelligence.
Researchers in Silicon Valley are using strategy games, such as Starcraft II, to teach systems how to solve complex problems on their own.
But artificial intelligence (AI) programs can then ""be readily adapted"" to wage cyber-warfare, the MoD says.
Officials are particularly concerned about the ability of rogue states and terrorists to mount advanced persistent threat attacks, which can disable critical infrastructure and steal sensitive information.
""Not only will AI increase the variety and tempo of cyber-attacks, it will also decrease the cost and increase the variety of actors able to undertake this activity,"" the report says.
""As the requirement for skilled specialists involved in the attack diminishes, the limitation will become access to the AI algorithms needed to conduct such an attack.
""In other words, any actor with the financial resources to buy, or steal, an AI APT (advanced persistent threat) system could gain access to tremendous offensive cyber-capability, even if that actor is relatively ignorant of internet security technology.
""Given that the cost of replicating software can be nearly zero, that may hardly present any constraint at all. This is likely to be a live issue by 2020 or soon thereafter.
""For example, the state-of-the-art AI is being trained in tactical reasoning by playing computer strategy games.
""AIs like this could then be readily adapted to drive APT cyber-attack tactics, where the AI is competing against human or non-adaptive automated cyber-defenders.""
The report cites Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence research project, which is using Starcraft II - a real-time strategy game for PC and Mac users, launched in 2010 - to train programs to think for themselves.
London-based DeepMind, which says it is committed to making the world a ""better place"" through artificial intelligence, by solving complex problems such as climate change, has also used Atari and Go games to train its systems.
But, like other artificial intelligence researchers, those at DeepMind were attracted to the complexity and fast-moving nature of Starcraft, which involves a three-way conflict between humans, the insectoid Zerg and Protoss aliens.
DeepMind said testing its artificial intelligence ""agents"" in games ""that are not specifically designed for artificial intelligence research, and where humans play well"" was ""crucial"" to their development.
Starcraft players build bases to gather resources that help make combat units to seek out and destroy opponents.
Other technology companies, including Facebook, have now developed artificial intelligence bots to play the game after makers, Blizzard Entertainment, released tools to enable them to do so.
Human players trounced artificial intelligence bots made by Facebook, DeepMind and other companies in a Starcraft tournament in November, suggesting there is still some way to go before the robots take over.
Steven Murdoch, an information security research fellow at University College London, said artificial intelligence bots with the ability to carry out sophisticated cyber-attacks on their own were ""fairly far away"".
Even those that could play games, such as Go and Starcraft, against humans were ""not very creative"" and relied on following ""a simple set of rules"".
""As technology advances, more automation will be available, particularly for the delivery of malicious software, but the preparation of attacks and development of tactics will still require human expertise for the foreseeable future,"" he told BBC News.
AI programs could be stolen and misused, as the MoD says in its report, but current systems ""are quite specific to a particular task and it takes considerable skill and expertise to adapt a system to a new application area,"" he added.
The MoD report says the private sector is leading the way in artificial intelligence research - and the technology industry's reluctance to appear too close to defence or security agencies is creating a skills shortage in the military.
""Some Western commercial entities have publicly declared policies stating they will not contract with defence or security agencies, which may compound the challenges facing the MoD,"" says the report.
""This is in stark contrast to other states, which have enshrined access rights to expertise, technology and data in their national legislation.""
The report proposes setting up a register ""of security cleared UK nationals with AI and robotics skills"" to be called on in times of emergency.",Yes

The pair are allegedly part of a ""hacking group"" known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, affiliated with China's main intelligence service.
They have not been arrested.
The US and UK have accused China of violating an agreement relating to commercial espionage.
Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong worked for a company called Huaying Haitai and in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, the US court filing says.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that from at least 2006 until 2018, the two extensively hacked into computer systems with the aim of stealing intellectual property and confidential business and technological information from:
The FBI said they had also hacked into US Navy computer systems and stolen the personal information of more than 100,000 personnel.
FBI director Christopher Wray said the two men were at present ""beyond US jurisdiction"".
Announcing the unsealing of the indictments, US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said China had violated a 2015 agreement under which it had pledged to not engage in commercial cyber-spying.
Mr Rosenstein said his department's move had been co-ordinated with US allies in Europe and Asia to rebuff ""China's economic aggression"".
He added: ""We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities.""
The UK government said it was joining allies in holding the Chinese government responsible for a global campaign targeting commercial secrets.
UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""This campaign is one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date, targeting trade secrets and economies around the world.
""These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets.""
Australia and New Zealand said they too held China responsible for the global hacking campaign and joined their ""like-minded partners"" in condemning the activity.
By Gordon Corera, security correspondent
This is the latest salvo in Washington's attempt to pressure Beijing on a range of issues, with economic espionage one of the most high-profile.
US and UK officials are reluctant to name the companies that have been hit but they say the economic damage has been significant.
The hackers, officials say, work under the direction of China's Ministry of State Security - one of the country's intelligence organisations.
""It is organised more like a corporation than a gang,"" one UK official says, adding that British intelligence has the highest level of confidence in their assessment of who was responsible.
The UK and US believe China is breaking a 2015 agreement not to steal commercial data to help its companies. There was a dip in activity after the deal was signed (which followed a period of pressure by Washington, including the indictment of Chinese military hackers and the threat of sanctions).
But US and UK sources both say that recently they have seen Chinese hackers return, now operating more stealthily, whereas in the past they were easier to spot.
Where the US has been vocal in recent months, this is the first time the UK has spoken out - perhaps because it has been concerned about risking trade ties and getting pulled into the Trump administration's broader confrontation with Beijing.
UK officials say they have raised the matter privately a number of times with Beijing over the last two years, including during the prime minister's visit earlier this year, and officials are keen to stress that they think the relationship with China is strong enough to allow them to address these issues without causing wider problems.",Yes

Targets included military personnel, activists, journalists and lawyers.
Researchers say they traced the malware to a Lebanese government building.
The threat, dubbed Dark Caracal by the researchers, looks as if it could come from a nation state and appears to use shared infrastructure linked to other nation-state hackers, the report said.
The malware takes advantage of known exploits and targets mainly Android phones.
Data was traced back to a server in a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut, according to researchers.
""Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the GDGS is associated with or directly supporting the actors behind Dark Caracal,"" the report said.
""People in the US, Canada, Germany, Lebanon, and France have been hit by Dark Caracal. Targets include military personnel, activists, journalists, and lawyers, and the types of stolen data range from call records and audio recordings to documents and photos,"" said EFF director of cybersecurity Eva Galperin.
""This is a very large, global campaign, focused on mobile devices. Mobile is the future of spying, because phones are full of so much data about a person's day-to-day life.""
Mike Murray, vice-president of security intelligence at Lookout said: ""Dark Caracal is part of a trend we've seen mounting over the past year whereby traditional advanced persistent threat actors are moving toward using mobile as a primary target platform.""
In a statement published on the Lookout blog, Google said it was confident that the infected apps were not downloaded from its Play Store.
""Google has identified the apps associated with this actor, none of the apps were on the Google Play Store. Google Play Protect has been updated to protect user devices from these apps and is in the process of removing them from all affected devices.""
The researchers believe Dark Caracal has been operating since 2012 but it has been hard to track because of the diversity of seemingly unrelated espionage campaigns originating from the same domain names.
Over the years Dark Caracal's work has been repeatedly misattributed to other cybercrime groups, the researchers said.
In November, Afghanistan moved to ban WhatsApp and Telegram as a way to stop insurgent groups from using encrypted messaging. And in December, Iran moved to restrict use of the apps after a series of anti-establishment protests.
Use of an app that can steal data would give nation states much more information than simply banning them, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.
""It is always hard to prove that a nation state is involved. During the Cold War, countries made use of mercenaries and that's what we are seeing online now.""
He said it was unclear where the infected apps had been downloaded from.
""Google is saying that they were not downloaded from there but it is difficult to know where else they came from. It may be that people are getting suckered into something that looks like an official site. People need to be careful what they are downloading.""",Yes
103,4,Advanced Persistent Threat,Russian hacker gang arrested over $25m theft,2 June 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36434104,"Russia has arrested 50 people accused of using malware to steal more than 1.7bn roubles ($25m; Â£18m).
The gang allegedly seeded websites with malware that gave them access to victims' PCs and, from there, their bank accounts.
Technical tricks used by the hackers made it hard for security software to spot the malicious code once it had compromised a machine.
It is believed to be the largest ever arrest of hackers in Russia.
The Russian authorities carried out raids in 15 regions across the country to round up the gang, the FSB internal security service said.
""As a result of [house] searches a large quantity of computer equipment was confiscated along with communications gear, bank cards in false names, and also financial documents and significant amounts of cash confirming the illegal nature of their activity,"" the FSB said.
The gang is believed to have stolen cash using a malicious trojan called Lurk that it hid on some of Russia's most popular websites.
Anyone visiting a website booby-trapped with Lurk would be infected with the malware. Once on a victim's PC, the malware then downloaded more software modules, giving the cyber thieves remote access to the machine.
This was used to steal login names and passwords for online bank accounts. In particular, they targeted accounts held at Sberbank - one of Russia's largest banks.
""Lurk started attacking banks one-and-a-half years ago; before then its malicious program targeted various enterprise and consumer systems,"" said Ruslan Stoyanov, head of computer incident investigation at Kaspersky Lab that helped uncover the gang's activities.
Mr Stoyanov said Kaspersky helped police profile the gang's network of computers and servers used to grab cash, and from that information they were able to trace the individuals involved.
The arrests helped to thwart pending money transfers that would have netted the group a further 2.3bn roubles, the FSB said.
Russian security firm Group IB, which profiles cyber crime groups in Eastern Europe, said the Lurk gang had been operating since 2011.
The group initially went after clients of banks but had recently changed focus, said Group IB spokesman Victor Ivanovsky.
""In recent months we have detected a growing activity in performing Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks on Russian banks by the Lurk group,"" he said.
Attacks that use APT techniques are typically the hardest to defend against because they are carefully customised for each target and can exploit formerly unknown vulnerabilities to get around security software.
The Lurk group switched to APT-based attacks in early 2016 when the source code for the well-known Buhtrap malware was made public.
The gang used Buhtrap to craft emails that looked like they came from industry groups that certify bank and accounting staff, in an attempt to trick people into opening messages containing Lurk.",Yes
104,5,Advanced Persistent Threat,Cyber-attack: US and UK blame North Korea for WannaCry,19 December 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42407488,"The US and UK governments have said North Korea was responsible for the WannaCry malware attack affecting hospitals, businesses and banks across the world earlier this year.
The attack is said to have hit more than 300,000 computers in 150 nations, causing billions of dollars of damage.
It is the first time the US and UK have officially blamed them for the worm.
Thomas Bossert, an aide to US President Donald Trump, first made the accusation in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.
Mr Bossert, who advises the president on homeland security, said the allegation was ""based on evidence"".
He did not produce any evidence in the article, but said US findings concurred with judgments from other governments and private companies.
He added that Australia, Canada, and New Zealand also share the US conclusion that North Korea was behind the attack.
Following the interview, the UK Foreign Office also blamed ""North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions"".
The National Cyber Security Centre assessed that is ""highly likely"" that the North Korean Lazarus hacking group had committed the attacks, Minister for Cyber Lord Ahmad said in a statement.
In May, Windows computers hit by the cyber-attack had their contents locked, with users asked to a pay a ransom to have their data restored. EU police body Europol called the scale of the attack ""unprecedented"".
Analysis: Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent
Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, first attributed the May 2017 Wannacry attack to North Korea within weeks of the ransomware spreading.
The speed was because the UK led the international investigation after the National Health Service was hit hard.
The US intelligence community may have taken longer to concur with that assessment but there is still the question of why the White House is only going public now.
Governments used to be cautious about attribution in cyber attacks but it is becoming increasingly common - beginning with the claim North Korea was behind the attack on Sony in 2014 and more recently involving Russia's alleged hacking in the 2016 US election.
This latest claim is almost certainly an attempt to put more pressure on North Korea in the crisis over its nuclear programme with the attempt to rally international support behind the notion that the country is a real danger - whether from cyber weapons or nuclear weapons. And to make the case that further action, of some kind, needs to be contemplated.
In the Wall Street Journal piece, Mr Bossert said North Korea must be held ""accountable"" and that the US would continue to use a ""maximum pressure strategy"" to hinder the regime's ability to mount cyber-attacks.
He did not specify what action, if any, the US government planned to take in response to the findings.
North Korea is already facing major economic sanctions after being redesignated a state-sponsor of terrorism last month amid tension over its nuclear programme and missile tests.
""North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behaviour is growing more egregious. WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless,"" Mr Bossert wrote.
""As we make the internet safer, we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us, whether they act alone or on behalf of criminal organisations or hostile nations,"" he went on.
""The tool kits of totalitarian regimes are too threatening to ignore.""
He added that Microsoft and Facebook both acted to disable North Korean cyber-attacks ""on their own initiative last week, without any direction or participation by the US"".
Microsoft later issued a statement, saying that last week the company ""working together with Facebook and others in the security community, took strong steps to protect our customers and the internet from ongoing attacks by an advanced persistent threat actor known to us as ZINC, also known as the Lazarus Group"".
""Among other steps, last week we helped disrupt the malware this group relies on, cleaned customers' infected computers, disabled accounts being used to pursue cyber-attacks and strengthened Windows defences to prevent reinfection,"" the statement said.
However, some social media users said that - while crediting Microsoft and Facebook - Mr Bossert did not mention a UK security researcher who had ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious software.
The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code.
In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) was hit particularly hard by the cyber-attack, with 48 affected health trusts forced to turn many patients away for appointments and even surgeries.
It spread across the world, with Russia reportedly being badly hit, causing problems to the country's postal service.
In 2014, the US claimed North Korea were behind cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures, after it released a film featuring the fictional killing of its leader Kim Jong-un.
The entertainment company had its films leaked and details of corporate finances and private emails released online.
The North Koreans hit out at former president Barack Obama over the claim, but has not yet responded to the White House accusations about the WannaCry hack.
In October it said rumours from a UK government minister that they were behind the 2017 attack was ""groundless speculation"", and a ""wicked attempt"" to tighten international sanctions on the country.",Yes
105,6,Advanced Persistent Threat,US military contractors 'hit by Chinese hackers',18 September 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29250959,"Hackers associated with the Chinese government broke into the computers of airlines and military contractors over 20 times in a single year, according to the US Senate.
The attacks were allegedly targeted at systems that move troops and equipment.
They included breaking in to computers on a commercial ship and uploading malicious software on to an airline's computers, the Senate report alleged.
Chinese officials denied the allegations.
A year-long investigation was concluded in March, but the findings have only just been made public.
In a 12-month period from June 2012, it found evidence of about 50 cyber-attacks on military contractors.
Of those, 20 were attributed to ""an advanced persistent threat"", a term associated with attacks on governments. All were attributed to China.
The report did not disclose the names of the affected contractors.
""These peacetime intrusions into the networks of key defence contractors are more evidence of China's aggressive actions in cyberspace,"" senator Carl Levin, chairman of the committee, said.
Chinese embassy officials in Washington questioned the report, calling the accusations ""groundless"".
The row between China and the US over cyber-attacks has been a long-running one.
The Chinese government has previously accused US spies of infiltrating its computer networks.
In May the US government accused five Chinese military members of hacking into and stealing trade secrets from the computers of several large US companies.
The latest report revealed that officials had only been told about two of these incidents. It also found that US government agencies had failed to share the information about the attacks among themselves.
This lack of transparency from contractors has raised questions and prompted calls for new procedures about how such hacks are reported.
Senator Jim Inhofe, who sits on the committee, called for a central clearinghouse to make it easier for contractors to report suspicious cyber-activity.
According to the report, contractors are only required to report network-level cyber-intrusions.
Paul Dignan, from security firm F5 Networks, said: ""A lot of attacks target end-users with malware so that they can piggyback on legitimate access to the network.
""Firms use lots of security vendors but there are also lots of gaps and, without adequate integration, it is these gaps that will be exploited.""",Yes
106,7,Advanced Persistent Threat,Israeli Iron Dome firms 'infiltrated by Chinese hackers',31 July 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28583283,"The BBC has seen evidence that appears to confirm hackers stole several secret military documents from two government-owned Israeli companies that developed the Iron Dome missile defence system.
The breaches were first publicised by security blogger Brian Krebs on Monday.
The companies denied their classified networks had been infiltrated.
However, the team that discovered the incidents has given the BBC access to an intelligence report, which indicates hundreds of files were indeed copied.
The documents, which were stolen over a period of many months, relate to:
Cyber Engineering Services (CyberESI) tracked the activities of the hackers over eight months between 2011 and 2012.
It said the data taken by the hackers suggested they had been after intelligence relating to Iron Dome.
Iron Dome is a complex anti-missile defence system, which can intercept and destroy rockets and shells.
The technology has been widely credited with preventing the deaths of many Israeli civilians during the ongoing conflict with militants from Gaza.
CyberESI's report, compiled in 2013, also indicates the attacks were made using highly sophisticated tools resembling those used by Chinese hackers to infiltrate US defence firms - an attack in which the Chinese government denies any involvement.
""The data collected makes strong indications that the actors behind this attack originated from China,"" it says.
""This assertion is based on the activity during the past year that Cyber Engineering Services has observed on compromised networks, as well as the geo-location of the IP [internet protocol] addresses retrieving the exfiltrated data.""
""The nature of exfiltrated data and the industry that these companies are involved in suggests that the Chinese hackers were after information related to Israel's all-weather air defence system called Iron Dome.""
CyberESI, which operates out of Maryland in the US, monitored data being stolen from two leading Israeli defence contractors:
A spokeswoman for IAI initially confirmed to Mr Krebs the attack had taken place and been ""reported to the appropriate authorities"".
However IAI subsequently said the ""information reported regarding the leakage of sensitive information is incorrect"" and only its ""civilian non-classified"" network had been hacked.
A spokesman for Rafael said the company did ""not recall such an incident"".
But the report seen by the BBC suggests sensitive data was taken from IAI and that Rafael's network was compromised, with hackers able to deactivate security software and harvest authentication data, including passwords.
In total, the report says, gigabytes of data were stolen from the Israeli companies, including:
Some of the stolen technical documents are said by CyberESI to have contained intellectual property data and were marked as being controlled by US government International Traffic in Arms (ITAR) regulations.
Both IAI and Rafael were heavily involved in developing the Iron Dome missile defence system, which allows Israel to intercept rockets fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip.
The US, which already collaborates with Israeli firms over Arrow III - jointly designed by IAI and Boeing, now wants to invest in future versions of Iron Dome technologies.
In May 2013, the Pentagon accused China of carrying out a sophisticated cyber-spying campaign on US diplomatic, economic and defence organisations.
The raid on the Israeli companies bore similar characteristics, experts at CyberESI told the BBC, using tools that were ""known to originate from"" China.
The attacks were part of an advanced persistent threat (APT) - a form of highly organised and targeted hacking.
APTs have been used for industrial espionage in the past and tend to use sophisticated methods not easily available to the vast majority of cyber-thieves.
CyberESI's report also featured a third Israeli company, Elisra, originally a US company and now a leading supplier to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Elisra, which is not involved in Iron Dome, appears to have been comprehensively infiltrated by the hackers, who stole data from folders named ""Military Spacs"" and ""UAV"" and infiltrated the email accounts belonging to the chief executive and several senior managers.
The attackers also stole passwords and sign-in details, allowing them to roam around the networks undetected.
Elisra did not respond to a BBC request for comment.
In January 2014, another security company reported that 15 Israeli defence computers had been compromised via a malicious email attachment.",Yes
107,8,Advanced Persistent Threat,China condemns hacking report by US firm Mandiant,20 February 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21515259,"China's military says a report linking it to prolific hacking of US targets is flawed.
In a statement, the Defence Ministry said the report lacked ""technical proof"" when it used IP addresses to link hacking to a military unit.
The report identified a Shanghai high-rise used by the military as the likely home of a hackers to whom it attributed multiple attacks on US companies.
The US says it has repeatedly raised concerns with China about cyber theft.
The Chinese ministry statement, posted on its website, said that many hacking attacks were carried out using hijacked IP addresses.
There was no clear definition of what constituted a hacking attack, it went on, and as it was a cross-border, deceptive business, it was hard to pin down where attacks originated.
It suggested that the ""everyday gathering"" of online information was being wrongly characterised as spying.
The detailed report, released on Tuesday by US-based computer security company Mandiant, looked at hundreds of data breaches, most of which it attributed to what it termed ""Advanced Persistent Threat"" actors.
The details it had uncovered, it said, showed that these groups were based primarily in China and that the Beijing government was aware of them.
The most prolific of these actors was APT1, Mandiant said, describing it as ""one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen"".
The firm said it had traced the hacking activities of APT1 to a Shanghai building. Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army ""is also located in precisely the same area"" and the actors had similar ""missions, capabilities and resources"", it added.
APT1, it said, was staffed by hundreds of proficient English speakers. It had hacked into 141 companies across 20 industries, stealing information including blueprints, business plans, pricing documents, user credentials, emails and contact lists.
Spokesman Jay Carney said the White House was ""aware"" of the Mandiant report and its contents. While not commenting directly, he described cyber espionage as a ""very important challenge"".
""We have repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber-theft with senior Chinese officials including in the military and we will continue to do so,"" he said.
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, meanwhile, said that the issue came up ""in virtually every meeting we have with Chinese officials"".
""We consider this kind of activity a threat not only to our national security but also to our economic interests and [we are] laying out our concerns specifically so that we can see if there's a path forward,"" she said.
China has long been suspected of a role in cyber hacking. But the issue has become more high-profile in recent months following widely reported hacks into media outlets including the New York Times - in that case apparently linked to a report by the paper on the wealth of relatives of outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao.
The Chinese Defence Ministry statement pointed out that China was also a victim of hacking attacks.
A Global Times editorial accused the US and its major allies of hyping up a China hacking ""threat"".
""China should refute the allegations of US company Mandiant with authoritative reports from its technology sector,"" it said.
""As a long-term counter-measure, China needs to encourage those institutions and individuals who have been subject to cyber-attacks from US IP addresses to stand up and tell the world what happened to them.""",Yes
108,9,Advanced Persistent Threat,Government 'may have hacked IMF',13 June 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13748488,"Hackers who broke into the International Monetary Fund's computer system may have been backed by a nation state, according to security experts.
They point to the sophisticated nature of the attack and the resources needed to develop it.
Malicious software, designed to steal confidential files, was installed on at least one IMF computer.
Although government involvement is widely suspected, the IMF has not released enough details to be sure.
Based on the limited information made public, it appears that the attack came from a specific PC that had been deliberately infected.
Hacker software was likely to have been installed on it in what is known as a spear-phishing attack, which sees highly targeted scam e-mails sent to specific victims.
A memo circulated internally at the IMF reported that ""suspicious file transfers"" had been detected.
Tom Kellerman, a security expert who has worked for the IMF and now sits on the board of the International Cyber Security Protection Alliance told Reuters news agency that it was ""a targeted attack"" with code written specifically to give a nation state a ""digital insider presence"" on the IMF network.
Graham Titherington, a security analyst with research firm Ovum agreed with the nation state theory.
""Any attack that shows money, time and resources went on it points to a state attack. States and their intelligence agencies have far more resources than criminal gangs,"" he said.
The information held by the IMF would clearly be most valuable to a country, he added.
""It has masses of economic information from the performance of countries to the state of their balance sheets. For countries deciding where to invest it is invaluable,"" he said.
State-sponsored hacking has gained prominence in recent months.
""Google shifted the debate by going public on a hack attack believed to be by China,"" said Mr Titherington.
The Chinese government has denied involvement in the recent attack on Google's e-mail accounts.
The incident compromised the personal Gmail accounts of hundreds of top US officials, military personnel and journalists.
Google said that the campaign to obtain passwords originated in the Chinese city of Jinan and was aimed at monitoring e-mail.
According to Mark Darvill, director of security firm AEP Networks, many countries are involved in cyber espionage but China remained at the ""forefront"".
""China has recently set up a cyber terrorism unit which is very likely to be looking at opportunities rather than to stop attacks,"" he said.
Not everyone is convinced that state-sponsored attacks or Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs) are the cause of the IMF hack.
Tal Be'ery, a web researcher at security firm Imperva said it could be a ""convenient excuse"".
""It is easier for organisations to hide under this excuse when really it is something lacking in their defences.
""We don't have enough credible information about the IMF attack. It needs to provide good evidence that it was a APT. It is just as likely to be a lone hacker acting out of curiosity,"" he said.
The most high profile state-sponsored attack to date remains the Stuxnet worm, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities.
Experts believe the complex malicious code originated from either the Israeli or US governments.",Yes
109,10,Advanced Persistent Threat,China military unit 'behind prolific hacking',19 February 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21502088,"A secretive branch of China's military is probably one of the world's ""most prolific cyber espionage groups"", a US cyber security firm has said.
Mandiant said Unit 61398 was believed to have ""systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data"" from at least 141 organisations around the world.
The White House said it has taken its concerns about cyber-theft to the highest levels of China's government.
China has denied hacking and questioned Mandiant's report.
""Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei.
""Determining their origins are extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable.
Mr Hong added that Beijing ""firmly opposes hacking"", has taken steps to prevent it and is also a victim of cyber attacks.
In an indication of the military sensitivity around the Shanghai site pinpointed by the report as home to the hacking group, the BBC's John Sudworth and his camera crew were briefly detained by soldiers when they went to film the facility. They were only released once they had handed over their footage.
In its unusually detailed report, US-based computer security company Mandiant said it had investigated hundreds of data breaches since 2004, most of which it attributed to what it termed ""Advanced Persistent Threat"" actors.
The details it had uncovered, it said, ""convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese government is aware of them"".
The most prolific of these actors is APT1, which Mandiant says is ""a single organisation of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006"".
""From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen,"" it said, adding that it was ""likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China's cyber threat actors"".
""We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support,"" said Mandiant.
The firm said it had traced the hacking activities of APT1 to the site of 12-storey building in the Pudong area of Shanghai. It said that Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army ""is also located in precisely the same area"" and that the actors had similar ""missions, capabilities and resources"".
Among the findings about APT1 in the report were that it:
Unit 61398 has for some time been suspected by the US of being central to China's cyber espionage programme, the New York Times reports.
Mandiant admitted there could be one alternative explanation for its findings: that ""a secret, resourced organisation full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398's gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398's known mission"".
Several governments, foreign companies and organisations have said in the past they suspect China of carrying out extensive cyber espionage over periods of several years.
On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the Obama administration had ""repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials including in the military and we will continue to do so"".
Mr Carney declined to comment specifically on the contents of the report.
Last month, the New York Times said its systems had been infiltrated over a period of four months, after it wrote a report on the alleged wealth of China's outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao.
Mandiant, which the paper hired to investigate, traced the hack to China. However, the paper said its breach had been attributed to a different group. The Wall Street Journal also reported a China-based hack.
At the time, China's foreign ministry dismissed the New York Times accusations as ""groundless"", saying that to ""conclude without hard evidence that China participated in such hacking attacks is totally irresponsible"".",Yes
110,11,Advanced Persistent Threat,Chemicals and defence firms targeted by hacking attack,31 October 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15529930,"At least 29 firms involved in the chemicals industry were targeted by a recent series of cyber-attacks traced to China, according to Symantec.
The security company said it had evidence a further 19 companies, including defence specialists, had also been affected.
It said the attacks began in late July and lasted until mid-September.
Symantec said the campaign was focused on intellectual property, including formulas and design processes.
While the report did not reveal the names of any of the companies involved, it did say they included Fortune 100 firms.
It disclosed that at least 12 of the infected companies were based in the US, five in the UK, and two in Denmark.
Several of the firms were also said to have developed materials for military vehicles.
US giant Dow Chemicals confirmed to the BBC that it had been the target of ""unusual emails"" received during the summer.
""Dow engaged internal and external response teams, including law enforcement, to address the situation,"" he said.  ""As a result, we have no reason to believe our operations were compromised.""
Symantec said workers at the organisations were sent emails asking them to open an attachment.
It said in some cases they claimed to be invitations from established business partners, in others a security update.
The firm said if the attachments were opened they installed a piece of code known as a Trojan horse, which allowed the hackers to obtain details of the targets' computer networks. The attackers were then able to use this information to locate and copy files to another part of their targets' systems, from where they were extracted.
Symantec identified the Trojan involved as PoisonIvy, which it said was developed by a Chinese speaker.
The firm also said it had traced the attacks back to a ""20-something male located in the Hebei region of China"" who funnelled the process through a US computer server.
Symantec said that when prompted, the man provided contact details for someone who would ""perform hacking for hire"". However, the company was unable to establish whether this was the same person or a different individual.
The incidents are being linked to earlier attacks on carmakers and human rights organisations.
""This is unfortunately becoming a new normal behaviour,"" Symantec's chief technology officer, Greg Day, told the BBC.
""We had at least a decade of cybercrime which generally targeted anybody. Then we had the emergence of very skilled techniques involving a lot of time and effort to target global organisations.""
""What we have now is almost the commercialisation of those techniques, using elements such as advanced persistent threats to pursue espionage and intellectual property theft, whether that is for their own gain or resale.""",Yes
111,12,Advanced Persistent Threat,Fantastic futures? Technology and business in 2012,27 December 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16288247,"Although those of us following the Mayan long calendar may be heading into 2012 with some trepidation, for those taking a longer-term view here is our annual peek into what next year holds.
Just as there are 12 days of Christmas, 12 people from across the technology spectrum give their insights to what the next year will hold.
We have the first six here, with part two following on Friday.
It's been a turbulent year for technology, and enterprise is no exception.
The consumerisation of IT continues apace with more and more of us bringing our own devices to work. Cloud computing seems to be almost ubiquitous and virtualisation no longer sounds like something to do with the transporter in Star Trek.
These topics and more all made it into last year's predictions. So what do the experts think is hovering on the horizon in 2012?
Number one would be social networking in business.
I think this is going to be very significant, because there are a number of reasons why companies might want to do this.
I think they've been slow to because of the perception that using social networks is wasting time, what you might call social not-working.
And in fact the opposite is true. I think the chances are that the future of enterprise software looks like Facebook.
We're seeing some companies adopting this already through systems like Chatter, Salesforce, Yammer and Jive - there's a whole bunch of them.
The other thing of course is that people entering the workforce at this point are used to using social media, so if you give them enterprise software that looks like Facebook, they'll feel right at home.
Another thing to watch for is that Google may lose control of Android.
It's because the tablet market is going to be divided between Amazon and Apple from the looks of things. It's very hard to see how anyone else can get in in the middle.
Amazon can subsidise the cost of its tablets using subsidies from the sale of content and other things. They are essentially portable shops, a very clever idea.
I think it's entirely possible that they dominate at the bottom end, and Apple dominates at the top end because it has scale, it can buy screen and processing power like no-one else can and it has the pricing power of its incredibly strong brand.
This is a problem for Google because if this does happen that means that the dominant kind of Android tablet is the kind where Android itself is sort of hidden and is controlled by Amazon.
The third thing is what happens to Research in Motion (RIM). Someone will buy them I think. The question is will they buy the whole of RIM in its current form.
RIM itself could split in two into its hardware and services division and start offering Blackberry services as an app.
I would be very surprised if RIM is still a company in its current form this time next year.
One of my predictions from last year I would like to reiterate, and that is wireless payments.
I was expecting the iPhone that came out this year to have an NFC (near field communication) chip in it and to shake up wireless payments.
It didn't happen. I'm still convinced it's going to happen, I think it's going to happen next year, and the iPhone 5 will have an NFC chip in it.
This I predict will be the latest example of where Apple blesses a technology that is out there but not really being done properly, and Apple comes along and goes: ""This is how you do it.""
Firstly big data is just getting bigger and starting to really impact not just the IT organisations and the people that know how to deal with data, but also the everyday knowledge worker, the everyday manager, and the everyday business leader, who have a lot of data they need to get through to make good decisions.
Number two is that the pace is quickening towards making enterprise software more like consumer software. Making it easier to use, faster, with far less training than ever before.
And then number three would be mobile. Mobile adoption is going mainstream [in business].
Organisations are adopting tablets and particularly the iPad at very fast rates, and people want to be able to access their information wherever they are, even if it's just in a meeting next door. I would say [these are] the top three trends we're seeing, in no particular order.
I think we're going to see significant press not from Apple but about Apple.
My prediction is that one of the things the iPhone 5 will do that will be significant will be to support NFC.
NFC is just a trigger to start the process of paying for goods. But NFC doesn't do any good unless merchants have a point of sale capability to accept that.
And given that Apple has a tremendous database around their app store and iTunes, I would suspect that Apple would want to play a part in creating a point of sale ecosystem.
I don't have a lot of details but I kind of suspect that this could be a place where they could play and have a big impact. Apple really has been a catalyst for multiple parts of the industry.
Not to say that Google won't continue to accelerate their payment purchasing mobile service.
Number two is probably around devices.
I think we're going to see Windows Phone not die a slow death but sort of hold its own.
I think RIM isn't done yet. Blackberry devices are popular worldwide and in some markets, in the Middle East and the UK, they're very popular. And they're certainly very well engrained in enterprises.
RIM has got some capabilities and features that the Apple, Android, even Windows Phones do not. So I would not count them out yet.
There's been enormous coverage of 3D printing. When we invested last year [in a 3D printing company] it was still science fiction, but it is rapidly moving from science fiction to science fact.
I think it's an incredibly powerful concept, the idea of consumers being able to choose and make devices and products themselves.
I think it's just at that point where the costs are falling very rapidly that it's now becoming more affordable. Two years ago it was used by high-end architectural practices and by Formula One teams to design and prototype their engines.
I think increasingly the smartphone is becoming a sort of remote control for the world around you.
Already you can order your food through this device, you can use it to hail a cab, to find concerts, and control the heating in your house.
Then there's mobile gaming. A lot of VCs (venture capitalists) are probably attacking this theme. Facebook gaming is massive - but mobile gaming is still pretty small despite the success of some big names like Angry Birds.
I think a lot of the games which are doing well in iOS and Android, they are fairly crude rip-offs of what happens on Facebook. I think very few companies have really thought deeply about the types of games that fully leverage this device.
I think there will be a Zynga-sized company or bigger built off the back of mobile.
Zynga has probably 50-60% of the social gaming market. The biggest company in mobile gaming has a 1.5% share.
I think 2011 was the year of awareness when it comes to advanced persistent threats [an organised group or government that commits cyber attacks], and sadly 2012 will be the year that advanced persistent threats continue at an incredible pace to plague the internet.
And I say that because they're relatively simple in their execution, they're taking advantage of relatively simple vulnerabilities, and they produce a lot of output in the form of all the information that becomes available to the perpetrators - which can be used for a number of reasons from espionage to fraud to blackmail.
Until that becomes very difficult to carry out, then we'll see the popularity of advanced persistent threats continue to increase. The thing that would stop the vulnerabilities being there is really basic security.
We've been talking about this for years. When you think about the effort it takes to secure a network, it tends to be getting it perfect that takes the effort, it should be relatively easy to secure the basics.
What conversation could be carried out today without cloud sneaking in there?
The security needs of the cloud are down to the capabilities of the cloud provider, in the rush towards the cloud I'm sure there will be many situations where the two don't match.
Bring your own device (BYOD) - which is the trend for people to buy their own [work] devices - can only increase as each generation becomes more computer literate.
That's left organisations with the choice of embracing that trend and proactively developing a stance and policies on BYOD.
If you ignore it people find ways to bring their favourite device to work and make it work. That can include things like setting up their own wireless access points or driving a hole through your firewall to access their email.
People can be very creative when it comes to using technology they love in the way that they want to use it.
The control that the IT department has traditionally had over IT is perhaps more illusory than they thought.
It is slipping away. The increasing use of mobile devices, and consumerisation, people using their own systems, social computing and social networking, collaboration tools, the rise in software as a service - business units are buying services as opposed to going to the IT department for systems.
It is a challenging time and IT leaders need to be proactive in their approach and changing their attitudes.
The thing that's going to hit most organisations I think is the whole big data explosion.
It is driven by the wider internet of things, the proliferation of connected devices producing a mountain of data.
Organisations are always saying: give us better data to help us make better decisions. I think IT is on the verge of being able to deliver some of those things. It's not going to be easy, there are all sorts of technology variables to be weighed, but the data can be collected, the data can be analysed.
I think the internet of things is going to be one of those potential game changers.
Mobile has become or is becoming the dominant form of access to the internet.
I think that the whole social thing, the investment bubble on this is going to burst. We've seen some outrageous valuations during the dot.com boom.
While I don't think that anyone is suggesting that social is going to go away, they're perhaps going to be a bit more realistic.
Part two of our look ahead will be published on Friday, 30 December.",Yes
112,1,phishing,Flubot: Warning over major Android 'package delivery' scam,23 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56859091,"A text-message scam that infects Android phones is spreading across the UK, experts have warned.
The message - which pretends to be from a package delivery firm, prompts users to install a tracking app - but is actually a malicious piece of spyware.
Called Flubot, it can take over devices and spy on phones to gather sensitive data, including online banking details.
Network operator Vodafone said millions of the text messages were already being sent, across all networks.
""We believe this current wave of Flubot malware SMS attacks will gain serious traction very quickly, and it's something that needs awareness to stop the spread,"" a spokesman said.
Customers should ""be especially vigilant with this particular piece of malware"", he said, and be very careful about clicking on any links in a text message.
Other networks, including EE and Three, followed with warnings of their own.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) later issued guidance about the threat, including advice on what to do if you have already downloaded the attacker's application by mistake.
""If users have clicked a malicious link it's important not to panic - there are actionable steps they can take to protect their devices and their accounts,"" the NCSC said in a statement.
The malware also has the ability to send more text messages to an infected user's contacts, helping it spread.
""The seriousness of these malicious text messages is underlined by Vodafone making the decision to alert its customers,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.
""This has the potential to become a denial-of-service attack on mobile networks, given the clear risk that a rogue application can be installed on users' smartphones and start spewing out endless text messages.
""The broader risk for users is a loss of highly sensitive personal data from their phones,"" he added.
While text message scams claiming to be about a package delivery firm are common, they have mostly focused on phishing - trying to trick the user into filling in a form with bank details and other information.
This newest wave differs because it tries to install malicious software on the phone itself - and because of the scale of its spread.
One version of the scam reported online pretends to be a text message from DHL, with a link to a website for parcel tracking.
If someone using an Android phone clicks on the link, they will be taken to a page ""explaining"" how to install the parcel tracking app using something called an APK.
APK files are a way of installing Android apps outside of the secure Google Play store. By default, such applications will be blocked for security reasons, but the scam page includes instructions on how to allow the installation.
That can be confusing, as there are some niche genuine cases for installing those kind of apps - such as downloading the Fortnite video game, which was removed from the official app store amid a major legal row between its owner and Google.
Apple iPhone users are not affected as those phones cannot install Android APKs.
In a blog post detailing the scam, security researcher Paul Morrison wrote that he expects the ""success rate would be low"" due to the hurdles involved.
But he said: ""With the number of SMS being sent out, just a 0.1% success rate could be very profitable.""
The Flubot malware has also spread in other countries in recent months - notably Spain, Germany and Poland.
Kate Bevan, computing editor at consumer magazine Which? said people have to be ""wary"" of texts.
""If you're not sure, contact the delivery company's official customer service helpline,"" she said.
""As ever, it's important to make sure that your mobile phone is up to date with security patches. Consider also installing mobile security software from a trusted brand.""
Industry body Mobile UK said users who receive a suspicious message should forward it to 7726 to report it, a spokesman said - and then delete the message.",Yes
113,2,phishing,Twitter hack: Staff tricked by phone spear-phishing scam,31 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53607374,"The unprecedented hacking of celebrity Twitter accounts this month was caused by human error and a spear-phishing attack on Twitter employees, the company has confirmed.
Spear-phishing is a targeted attack designed to trick people into handing out information such as passwords.
Twitter said its staff were targeted through their phones.
The successful attempt let attackers tweet from celebrity accounts and access their private direct messages.
The accounts of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and reality star Kim Kardashian West were compromised, and shared a Bitcoin scam.
It reportedly netted the scammers more than $100,000 (Â£80,000).
The attack has raised concerns about the level of access that Twitter employees, and subsequently the hackers, have to user accounts.
Twitter acknowledged that concern in its statement, saying that it was ""taking a hard look"" at how it could improve its permissions and processes.
""Access to these tools is strictly limited and is only granted for valid business reasons,"" the company said.
Not all the employees targeted in the spear-phishing attack had access to the in-house tools, Twitter said - but they did have access to the internal network and other systems.
Once the attackers had acquired user credentials to let them inside Twitter's network, the next stage of their attack was much easier.
They targeted other employees who had access to account controls.
By Joe Tidy, cyber-security reporter
Twitter isn't clarifying whether or not their employees were duped by an email or a phone call. The consensus in the information security community is that it was the latter.
Phonecall spear-phishing, commonly known as vishing, is bread and butter for the sort of hackers who are suspected of this attack.
The criminals obtained the phone numbers of a handful of Twitter staff and, by using friendly persuasion and trickery, got them to hand over usernames and passwords that gave them an initial foothold into the internal system.
As Twitter puts it, the scammers ""exploited human vulnerabilities"". You can imagine how it possibly went:
Hacker to Twitter employee: ""Hi, I'm new to the department and I've locked myself out of the Twitter internal portal, can you do me a huge favour and give me the login again?""
The fact that Twitter staff were susceptible to these basic attacks is embarrassing for a company built on being at the forefront of digital technology and internet culture.
Twitter said the initial spear-phishing attempt happened on 15 July - the same day the accounts were compromised, suggesting the accounts were accessed within hours.
""This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems,"" the company said.
""This was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service.""
Twitter did not state whether the attack involved voice calls, despite a previous report from Bloomberg stating that at least one Twitter employee was contacted by attackers through a phone call.
Phishing is most commonly done by email and text message, encouraging recipients to click on links that take them to websites with fake log-in screens.
Spear-phishing is a version of the scam targeted at one person or a specific company, and is usually heavily customised to make it more believable.
One victim whose account was compromised told the BBC there were several things Twitter could have done differently.
""They shouldn't give the ability to a single employee to remove both email address on file and two-factor authentication,"" they said.
""I understand why there's a need for this - for example if a dormant account has a very old email that's inaccessible and you've lost your phone or something-  but it should require two employees to sign off.""
They also said communication from Twitter was poor.
""It took 10 days to reset this account with no actual personal response from Twitter. I literally got a 'click here to continue' automated email from their system when they added my email back to the account to allow me to reset it - and it looked like a phishing email.""",Yes
114,3,phishing,Gmail 'safer than parliament's email system' says Tory MP,13 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56733667,"Google's email service - Gmail - is âmore secureâ than parliament's email system, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee has claimed.
Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4âs Today programme he has repeatedly been the focus of cyber attacks over the past three years.
Hackers have tried to access his account and sent emails impersonating him, he told the BBC.
The Tory MP believes China and Iran were behind some of these attempts.
âI was told by friends at GCHQ that I was better off sticking to Gmail, rather than using the parliamentary system, because it was more secure,â said Mr Tugendhat.
âFrankly, that tells you the level of security and the priority we're giving to democracy in the United Kingdom.â
A spokeswoman said the parliamentary email system ""offers significantly higher levels of security than external providers"".
The National Cyber Security Centre said that MPs should continue to use the parliamentary email system.
Mr Tugendhat is one of a number of British politicians being sanctioned by China over what it sees as the spreading of âlies and disinformationâ about human rights abuses of the Uyghur population in the Xinjiang region of China.
The sanctions ban Mr Tugendhat, who leads the China Research Group with fellow Conservative Neil O'Brien, from travelling to China.
âIn the last week, emails were sent around claiming to be from me - claiming that I'd resigned from the foreign affairs committee.""
He added ""many other cyber attacks have been perpetrated either on me or on others"" and implied the attacks were connected to the recent sanctions by China
Tarah Wheeler, a cyber-security fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, described Gmail as ""a very safe email choiceâ, but said an Advanced Protection Programme - with a security key and multi-factor authentication - should be in place to ensure the highest level of security.
âItâs what I, and many other security professionals, use for our email and recommend to family members.""
Usability is often prioritised by governments and âsometimes security becomes an expensive after-thoughtâ, she added.
âThe IT administrators who work to balance all those things are often underfunded - and supporting them is incredibly important to increasing the security of governmental systems.â
But Dr Stephanie Hare, a technology researcher, said parliament should have âmuch greater security than Gmail"".
âI am not surprised to hear that MPs' email accounts are targeted - that is to be expected.
âAll systems are vulnerable, but we would want to see the highest possible security for the email systems used by our elected officials, in order to protect our democracy,"" she said.",Yes
115,4,phishing,Obinwanne Okeke: Nigerian email fraudster jailed for 10 years in US,17 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56085217,"A Nigerian businessman, who once appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine, has been jailed for 10 years in the US over a cyber fraud scam that led to the theft of about $11m (Â£8m).
Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, used Nigerian-based companies to defraud people in the US.
His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims.
In 2016 Forbes Africa listed Okeke among the most influential businesspeople under the age of 30.
From around 2015 to 2019, he was part of a group which engaged in a conspiracy to conduct various computer-based frauds, including creating fake websites, the US Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia said in a statement after he was sentenced.
It added that the 33-year-old, who was arrested two years ago, used ""subterfuge and impersonation"" to lure his victims.
Okeke's Invictus Group companies were also accused of working with conspirators to create profiles of hundreds of victims including people in the US's Eastern District of Virginia.
In one phishing attack in 2018 the fraudsters managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar's heavy industrial and farm equipment.
They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11m, and moved the funds overseas.
Okeke's sentencing demonstrated the US authorities' determination to pursue international cybercriminals no matter where they committed their crimes, said the statement from the Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia.",Yes
116,5,phishing,Police warn students to avoid science website,19 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-56462390,"Police have warned students in the UK against using a website that they say lets users ""illegally access"" millions of scientific research papers.
The City of London police's Intellectual Property Crime Unit says using the Sci-Hub website could ""pose a threat"" to students' personal data.
The police are concerned that users of the ""Russia-based website"" could have information taken and misused online.
The Sci-Hub website says it ""removes all barriers"" to science.
It offers open access to more than 85 million scientific papers and claims that copyright laws should be abolished and that such material should be ""knowledge to all"".
It describes itself as ""the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers"".
But Max Bruce, the City of London police's cyber protection officer, has urged universities to block the website on their networks because of the ""threat posed by Sci-Hub to both the university and its students"".
""If you're tricked into revealing your log-in credentials, whether it's through the use of fake emails or malware, we know that Sci-Hub will then use those details to compromise your university's computer network in order to steal research papers,"" he said.
The City of London Police, which is the national lead for fraud, has warned that students studying online at home might be vulnerable.
""Students should be aware that accessing such websites is illegal, as it hosts stolen intellectual property,"" said Det Insp Kevin Ives.
He warned that visitors to the website, whose Twitter account has been suspended, are ""very vulnerable to having their credentials stolen"".
The police warning says scientific papers could have been obtained by a ""variety of malicious means, such as the use of phishing emails to trick university staff and students into divulging their login credentials"".
But the Sci-Hub website has previously told the BBC that it provides students with access to research papers for which the subscriptions are ""very expensive"".
Andrew Pitts, chief executive of the PSI Registry, which highlights ""academic piracy"", has warned that users ""may inadvertently download potentially dangerous content from this illegal site and put the security of their organisations at risk"".

117,6,phishing,Newcastle school targeted in fees phishing scam,20 January 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-46920810,"Fee-paying schools were targeted in a cyber attack which accessed parents' email addresses, it has emerged.
Fraudulent emails sent from school accounts offered a 25% discount on fees for paying quickly via the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.
Newcastle's Royal Grammar School warned parents of the ""sophisticated attack"". It has been approached for comment.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said other schools had been targeted and it was investigating.
In an email to parents, the grammar school's headmaster, John Fern, said it had reported the attack to police.
Because of the ""potential breach of data"" in the use of parent's email contacts, it is also liaising with the ICO.
This is required under the General Data Protection Regulation.
The emails, which included spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors, were sent on 29 December from the address of the school's bursar, who is responsible for fees.
The school told parents it was working with the company that provides its email systems, iSAMS, to ""establish exactly what happened"". ISAMS said it would be issuing a statement.
Mr Fern told parents the school would ""never ask for money or bank details in this way"" and apologised. No financial details were accessed, he added.
The ICO did not provide details of how many schools were affected but said: ""[We are] aware of other phishing type attacks that have been targeted towards schools.

118,7,phishing,Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks?,8 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419,"Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks.
Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.
Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware.
However, the new report comes on the back of a recent significant security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system.
And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with.
So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried?
Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.
Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers.
This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system.
Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware.
""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.
Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security.
""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot.""
There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as RobbinHood, a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019.
Another example is Thunderspy, an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other.
This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep.
""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.
""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more.""
The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops).
""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC.
Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software, because they only make money if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.
Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws.
The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years.
Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.
Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.
Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds.
""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do.""
Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole, to pay attention to hardware security.
""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.
""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected.""
Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.
""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.
""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""",Yes

Con-artists attempted to take advantage of the self-assessment filing deadline at the end of January to flood people with fake texts, emails and calls.
They posed as HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials and attempted to steal personal financial details.
Phone scam reports to HMRC tripled compared with December, it said.
There were a total of 33,053 reports in January, in addition to 46,210 phishing emails, and 26,643 suspicious text messages during the same month.
The number of bogus text message reports was twice the next highest level seen during any month of the last year.
Most of these scam messages offered bogus tax rebates, fake support or grants, or threatened legal action over unpaid tax.
A new scam involved criminals calling people saying that their national insurance number had been used fraudulently. This was a lie.
An HMRC spokesman said: ""If someone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from HMRC, saying that you can claim financial help, are due a tax refund or owe tax, or asks for bank or other personal details, it might be a scam.

The Emotet network obtains access to victims' computers, via malicious email attachments, then sells it to criminals who install more dangerous malware.
Police from the UK, EU, US and Canada worked together to ""disrupt"" Emotet.
Europol called it ""one of most significant botnets of the past decade"" and one of the main ""door openers"" for computer systems worldwide.
""Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware,"" it said.
Dmitry Smilyanets, from Recorded Future, said: ""Even if the creator and his support and operators are not arrested, they likely will not try to rebuild.
""They have enough cash to retire in peace - or start a new criminal adventure.
""A working botnet is a very complicated and gentle system.
""If more than a half of the infrastructure is not working, it's safe to say bye-bye.""
Emotet was initially a banking trojan, designed to spy on victims' computers and steal login details.
Victims would receive an apparently important Word document marked for their attention.
When opened, it would ask them to ""enable Macros"" - a seemingly innocent feature built into Microsoft Word that actually opened their computer up to attackers.
Lotem Finkelstein, of Check Point Software, said it had been tracking Emotet for years.
""The most successful and prevalent malware of 2020 by a long way"", he said, it had, over the course of the year, sent phishing emails with more than 150,000 different subject lines and 100,000 file names for the attachments.

122,11,phishing,Just Eat 'phishing' scammer faces jail,2 May 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43965622,"A computer hacker who sold the personal data of thousands of people on the dark web faces jail after admitting a string of offences.
Police began investigating Grant West, 26, after he conned details from Just Eat customers in 2015.
The personal data of around 165,000 people was compromised.
Detectives later found he had 63,000 credit and debit card details - and seized more than Â£500,000 in bitcoins belonging to West.
He admitted charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offences.
West, from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, used ""phishing"" emails to extract customer data from various companies.
Between July 2015 and December 2015 he targeted online food delivery firm Just Eat, using a scam in which customers received a bogus email offering a voucher in return for answering questions about the service.
The emails allowed West to harvest information - including customers' names, addresses and payment card details - in order to sell to other criminals.
There is no suggestion that Just Eat's own computer systems were hacked or compromised.
Detectives believe he targeted customers of just about every major online vendor, from ""Argos to Uber"", as part of his criminal enterprise, using millions of email addresses to indiscriminately trick people into revealing their financial information.
Once he had a complete set of customer details he would sell them on via the now-defunct online dark web market Alpha Bay, with the user name ""courvoisier"".
The details were sold as ""Fullz"" - a slang term on the dark web used to describe a full set of customer details that would allow others to defraud individual bank accounts and credit cards.
The courvoisier account sold details belonging to 9,627 people - many of whom lost significant amounts to other online fraudsters.
Police say West made more than Â£180,000 from the scam. The proceeds from his business were converted into Bitcoins and stored in multiple accounts.
The Just Eat phishing scam cost the firm more than Â£200,000 - but also gave specialist detectives from London's Metropolitan Police their first lead.
West used his girlfriend's laptop and police traced the computer via a series of IP addresses, despite his best efforts to cover his digital tracks.
As detectives moved in on West they realised that getting their hands on the laptop with his ""fingers on the keyboard"" was crucial.
A team of covert officers tracked West and while he was using the computer in the first class carriage on a train from Rhyl to London officers pounced on him, seizing the unlocked computer.
The arrest was captured on the train's CCTV.
On the laptop they found the financial information of more than 100,000 people.
Officers also raided West's home address and found an SD card with the details of 63,000 debit and credit cards, seven million email addresses with passwords, and the details of more than 500 companies - all the components required to commit mass online fraud.
They also seized Â£25,000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis.
As well as financial information, West also sold cannabis online - which he shipped to customers - and ""how to"" guides for fellow hackers.
Police say West treated his fraudulent activity as a ""day job"", sometimes spending 18 hours a day hacking financial information and doing online deals.
At first sight his lifestyle was simple - the family home was a caravan in a residential park - but West funded luxury holidays and goods with stolen credit card details.
His former girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, from North Wales, also enjoyed the cash generated by the frauds. At one point using stolen details to buy a new bikini.
She was sentenced on Wednesday to a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorised access of computer material.
His Honour Judge Michael Gledhill QC told Ms Brookes that she was ""very fortunate indeed"" not to be jailed and said of her relationship with West that she had ""fallen into the arms of a villain and a rogue"".
West has no formal qualifications and, although he directed the frauds, investigators believe he was working with others.
Bitcoin ""wallets"" belonging to West were emptied the day after he was arrested. At current prices those Bitcoins are estimated to be worth Â£1.5m.
Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gallagher - who led the investigation - said police were ""uncovering the darkness and shady areas"" where criminals operate on the dark web, and were ""bringing them into the light"".
""There was a myth that Bitcoin in particular, and crypto-currencies more generally, was anonymous and it was also a myth that people can operate with impunity on the dark web and remain anonymous,"" he said.
A spokesperson for Just Eat said ""We were made aware of a phishing scam which took place in 2015 and at the time took steps to mitigate thisâ¦ at no point were Just Eat systems compromised or breached.
""Protecting our brand and our customers from online fraud is of utmost importance to us.""
West will be sentenced on 25 May.

Grant West, 26, from Sheerness in Kent, sent ""phishing"" emails pretending to be from Just Eat and extracted the details of 63,000 credit and debit cards.
He admitted charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offences on 2 May.
Judge Michael Gledhill jailed West for 10 years and eight months.
West carried out cyber attacks on high street names including Sainsbury's, Asda, Uber, Argos and bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral to obtain email addresses.
Between July 2015 and December 2015 he sent customers scam emails masquerading as takeaway service Just East, offering a voucher in return for answering questions.
Once he had a complete set of customer details he would sell them on via the now-defunct online dark web market Alpha Bay.
The prosecution said a total of Â£84,000 was taken fraudulently from accounts held at Barclays, costing the bank more than Â£300,000 to remedy.
British Airways also suffered a Â£400,000 loss after Avios accounts were hacked.
The judge described West as ""a one man cyber crime wave"" and said Â£1.6m worth of cryptocurrency, which he made selling people's information on the dark web, is unaccounted for.
He said: ""When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless.
""This case should be a wake-up call to customers, companies and the computer industry to the very real threat of cyber crime.""
The Met Police said West made more than Â£180,000 from the scam with the proceeds being converted into Bitcoins and stored in multiple accounts.
The Just Eat phishing scam cost the firm more than Â£200,000, but there was no suggestion its own computer systems had been hacked or compromised, the court heard.
West used his girlfriend's laptop on which police found the financial information of more than 100,000 people.
When officers raided West's home address they found an SD card with the details of 63,000 debit and credit cards.
It also contained seven million email addresses with passwords, and the details of more than 500 companies.
Police also seized Â£25,000 in cash, more than Â£500,000 in bitcoins and half a kilogram of cannabis.

124,13,phishing,Covid: Warnings over vaccine email scam,28 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-55840397,"A woman who received a fake email offering her a coronavirus vaccination has criticised ""horrible"" fraudsters for preying on the vulnerable.
Kelly Davies, from Emsworth, Hampshire, said the email asking for her personal information looked genuine.
According to investigators Action Fraud, there has been a huge increase in phishing scams in the last week.
The NHS said the vaccine was free of charge and it would never ask a patient for their bank account details.
The email, which has been reported more than 1,000 times in 24 hours, asks the recipient to click on a link if they want to receive the vaccine.
They are then asked to input their bank card details.
Ms Davies, 42, said she was ""sceptical"" about the email as she knew people at higher risk than herself would be contacted first.
She added: ""It looked very much legitimate, with the NHS logos, and the government site logos, as you'd expect.
""It's quite worrying and there'll be people sat at home that are waiting and who need that vaccination.
""For people to prey on those individuals is awful. It's a horrible thing and people just shouldn't be doing that.""
Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud, said: ""It's despicable that fraudsters will take advantage of such an important tool in the fight against this evil and deadly disease.
""Not only are the people being targeted with this email at risk of losing money, or having their identity stolen, but they are also at risk of not receiving the real vaccine.""
She said the public needed to ""remain cautious and alert"".
Source: NHS
Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS medical director for primary care, said the excitement around the vaccine had brought out the ""cheats, crooks and con-people looking to make money from this life-saving programme"".
""The vaccine will always be free on the NHS,"" she added.
An NHS spokeswoman said patients were normally contacted by post, via the national booking system, regarding vaccine appointments.
They may also be contacted by the local GP practice by telephone or text message, she added.
Det Sgt Marcus Mills, based at the economic crime unit at Hampshire Constabulary, said: ""Sadly, despite being in a worldwide pandemic, criminals continue to seek and exploit vulnerable people with phishing email scams.""
He said residents should not click on any links within an email ""unless it is from a trusted source - regardless of how genuine the email may look"".
""Fraudsters are able to use sophisticated techniques and email address masking to make the email appear genuine,"" he explained.
""To protect yourself, you always click on the senders details of the email and this will allow recipients to see the full email address of the sender.
""You can then make a decision as to whether you believe this to be a genuine email address or not.""",Yes

A 75-year-old Montrose man was also persuaded to transfer Â£74,000 into other accounts.
Police said his bank managed to retrieve the money.

Flagship Group, based in Norwich, said the cyber attack on 1 November took ""most of our group's systems offline"".
It said the incident had been caused by a suspected phishing or ransomware attack.
It said it had closed down its online systems while it was investigated, and had reported the breach to police and the Information Commissioner's Office.
On its website it said: ""Despite our quick action, there has been some data encryption and some personal customer and staff data has been compromised.
""We do not yet have a complete picture of all the data that has been encrypted.""
The company also said it had ""a high level of security measures"" in place to protect data.
Flagship Group owns some 31,000 homes in the East of England and employs 1,200 people in its facilities, repairs, maintenance and heating departments.
In 2017-18, it had an annual turnover of Â£133.7m
It has tenants in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge and Essex and also builds and sells houses to private owners.
Chief executive David McQuade apologised to tenants affected by the breach and those experiencing delays in having repairs carried out.
""We are now working towards the recovery of all our systems,"" he said.
""The incident has caused considerable disruption to our staff and customer services and we are concentrating on emergency situations, to ensure our customers are safe.""
The firm said the matter had also been reported to the Regulator of Social Housing.
Norfolk Police said it was being dealt with by the National Cyber Security Centre.

127,16,phishing,Canadian university loses $10m in phishing scam,31 August 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41116177,"A Canadian university says staffers unwittingly lost $9.5m (C$11.8m; Â£7.5m) in an online phishing scam.
Fraudulent emails convinced staff at MacEwan University that one of its clients was changing its bank account details. Staff then paid money into the fraudulently created account.
The university, in Edmonton, Alberta, is auditing its business practices.
Police have traced most of the funds to accounts in Hong Kong and Montreal, but no charges have been laid.
The scam came to light when the real client complained of non-payment.
""There is never a good time for something like this to happen,"" university spokesperson David Beharry said in a statement.
""As our students come back to start the new academic year, we want to assure them and the community that our IT systems were not compromised during this incident.""
Phishing is a common type of internet fraud where scammers send emails that appear to be from a reputable company, enticing people to give up personal information.
Mr Beharry also said the university was working to ensure that this fraud would not impact future educational or business operations.
An internal review is expected to make recommendations on ways the school can prevent this from happening again.
A preliminary audit found that protocols around changing banking information were ""inadequate"" and staff missed a number of opportunities to identify the fraud.",Yes
128,17,phishing,"Phishing helps hackers hijack accounts, says Google study",10 November 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41940838,"Cyber-thieves grab almost 250,000 valid log-in names and passwords for Google accounts every week, suggests research.
The study by Google and UC Berkeley looked at the ways email and other accounts get hijacked.
It used 12 months of log-in and account data found on websites and criminal forums or which had been harvested by hacking tools.
Google said the research helped secure accounts by showing how people fell victim to scammers and hackers.
During the 12 months studying the underground markets, the researchers identified more than 788,000 credentials stolen via keyloggers, 12 million grabbed via phishing and 1.9 billion from breaches at other companies.
Phishing involves attempts to trick people into handing over personal information and keyloggers are programs that record every key someone presses when using a computer.
The most useful information for cyber-thieves came from keyloggers and phishing attacks as these included valid passwords in 12%-25% of attacks, it found.
Phishing attacks posed the biggest risk to users as these helped malicious hackers scoop up about 234,000 valid names and passwords every week. By contrast, keyloggers only yielded about 15,000 valid credentials each week.
Cyber-attackers also sought to grab other information that could be useful in attacks, said the researchers.
Data about a person's internet address (IP) as well as the device they were using and their physical location were all potentially useful for attackers seeking to defeat security checks.
Gathering this data was much harder, found the research, with only 3.8% of people who had credentials leaked also giving away IP addresses and fewer than 0.001% surrendering detailed device information.
In a blog, Google said it would use the results of the research to refine the ways it spotted and blocked attempts to take over accounts. In particular it would enhance efforts to use historical data about where users logged in and the devices they used to thwart impersonation attacks. The company has a range of resources for people affected or looking to protect themselves.
However, the researchers acknowledged that the ""multi-pronged problem"" of account hijacking required efforts in lots of different areas.
It noted that only 3.1% of people who had an account hijacked subsequently started using improved security measures, such as two-factor authentication, after they regained control of a lost account.
Because of this, they said, educating users about better ways to protect accounts should become a ""major initiative"".",Yes
129,18,phishing,Election candidates warned about phishing attempts,17 May 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39947628,"Candidates in the general election have been asked to look through their emails for signs that they have been targeted by a phishing attack.
The list of potential targets includes recent MPs.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of GCHQ, disclosed the request in a document released early on 16 May.
The BBC understands that the number of victims is currently understood to be in single figures.
Candidates have been asked to look for suspicious emails received after Jan 2017.
The NCSC declined to say if any data had been taken.
A report in the Financial Times said it was ""likely"" that the phishing campaign had been orchestrated by a state.
In a document titled Phishing: guidance for political parties and their staff, the centre says it has ""become aware of phishing attacks to gain access to the online accounts of individuals that were MPs before dissolution of Parliament"" and ""other staff who work in political parties"".
The NCSC said the attacks were likely to continue ""and may be sent to parliamentary email addresses, prospective parliamentary candidates, and party staff"".
The BBC understands that so far victims' personal emails have been affected but no successful phishing attempts have been made via parliamentary email addresses.
It is believed that the NCSC has contacted the Electoral Commission about the threat and that the commission will help to alert candidates.
The centre said that potential victims should look out for ""unexpected requests to reset your password for online or social media accounts (such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook or Twitter)"".
""Or you might have been asked to approve changes to your account that you've not requested.""
The NCSC did not say whether it knew who was behind the phishing campaign.
The warnings to political parties come as cyber-security officials brace themselves for some kind of incident during the elections.
No-one can be sure that anything will take place, but the experience of the US and more recently France has led them to believe that some kind of theft and then dump of information is possible.
In both those cases, a Russian hand is suspected.
Intelligence agencies have historically kept their distance from the communication of politicians due to the doctrine that says MPs should not be monitored.
But parties and politicians themselves have been asking for advice and guidance in recent months amid growing concerns.
Concern about elections being targeted by hackers has been running high, following the attack on the Democratic National Committee during the US presidential election.
US authorities attributed that incident to Russia and said that a significant component of the attack involved phishing.
More recently, the electoral campaign of President Emmanuel Macron in France was targeted by a similar campaign.
The NCSC has said the UK has ""systems in place to defend against electoral fraud at all levels and [we] have seen no successful cyber-intervention in UK democratic processes"".
The BBC understands that since last month, the NCSC has delivered cyber-security seminars to the UK's political parties, with the aim of helping them reduce the risk of succumbing to an attack.

Co-founder Karin Sode told BBC News an entire database had been stolen by hackers and included information on previous customers.
Data stolen included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, tariff and energy meter IDs, she said.
But with the exception of that of 15 small-business customers, no financial information had been accessed.
Those businesses' bank accounts and sort codes had been accessed, Ms Sode said.
And they had been contacted separately by phone.
Most of those affected are unlikely to face any direct financial risk.
But having their data stolen may leave them more vulnerable to phishing attacks - where a criminal pretends to be from an official source to try to obtain other information, often using what they already have to sound credible.
The breach was discovered on Wednesday morning.
And People's Energy has contacted the Information Commissioner's Office, the National Centre for Cyber-Security, the energy regulator Ofgem and the police.
Based in Edinburgh, the company also has customers in England and Wales.
Ms Sode said it was investigating the breach and had called in independent experts but so far had no information about the identity of the hackers.
She and David Pike founded People's Energy, in August 2017, with a commitment to sustainable energy and returning 75% of all profits to customers.
""This is a big blow in every way,"" Ms Sode said on Thursday.

131,20,phishing,"More than 746,000 NHS phishing emails blocked in a month",6 February 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42958331,"More than 746,000 phishing emails pretending to be from the NHS were blocked in just one month in 2017, the National Cyber Security Centre says.
A report on the first year of the GCHQ unit's cyber-defence programme found that it removed 121,479 phishing sites hosted in the UK.
This reduced the UK's share of global phishing attacks from 5.3% to 3.1%.
Three-quarters of UK government-related phishing sites were taken down in 24 hours.
Phishing emails trick users into visiting websites that impersonate known brands and ask the user to log in to their account.
This enables attackers to gather confidential login details or financial information.
Phishing emails are also used to trick people into opening malicious email attachments that install malware on their computers.
The methods of reducing phishing involved using various security scanning systems to perform millions of tests on government websites and emails being sent in and out of government networks.
""What they've done is not rocket science - the technology's been around for a while, but they've managed to persuade various government departments to do the simple things to reduce cyber-security threats dramatically,"" cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, told the BBC.
""Phishing emails from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) used to be the most common emails you'd see, but they got the HMRC to put the technology in place, and the spoofing emails dropped to zero in a matter of days.""
Cyber-security expert Graham Cluley said that technologies used were not new, but the NCSC's efforts had produced ""impressive results"".
""Of course they won't have caught every phishing attempt, but they will have helped stamp out many of the most convincing attacks,"" he told the BBC.
Martyn Thomas, Gresham College's professor of IT, agreed: ""I think their success rate on stopping really legitimate-looking spam is really high and they are to be congratulated.""
While Prof Thomas felt that the NCSC would benefit from having a ""longer-term vision"" when it came to cybersecurity, he felt the fact that the government agency could gain intelligence from GCHQ on potential cyber-attacks gave it an edge over commercial cybersecurity contractors.
Prof Woodward said the NCSC's work was ""an important development"" because the organisation was able to close down the opportunity for people to pretend to be from within the NHS, which would help to prevent future attacks.
""The biggest problem is people pretending to be within,"" he said. ""Whenever you receive something that seems to come from your own network, you inherently trust it.""",Yes
132,21,phishing,Spear-phishing scammer demanded sex show,22 March 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39338004,"Six weeks ago, a young woman called Zed (not her real name) was in a meeting at work when a message popped up on Facebook Messenger from a distant friend.
""Hey babe,"" it began.
The friend asked Zed to vote for her in an online modelling competition, which she agreed to do.
But then - disaster. Adding her email address to the competition register had caused a tech meltdown, her friend said. She needed to borrow her email log-in to fix it quickly and restore her votes.
Zed was unsure. The friend begged - her career was at stake, she pleaded. Still in the meeting and powerless to make a call, Zed gave in - a momentary leap of faith.
Except it was not her friend that she was talking to - someone else had got into the account and was pretending to be her.
It's a scamming technique known as spear phishing.
""Phishing uses behavioural psychology to trick victims into trusting the attacker in order to obtain sensitive information,"" said Paul Bischoff of Comparitech, who also talked to Zed.
""Spear phishing is less prevalent, but far more dangerous. Spear phishing targets an individual or small group of people. The attacker can gather personal information about their target to build a more believable persona.""
Besides never sharing the credentials for your online accounts, a good way to stay safe is to enable ""two-step authentication"". This means that users must enter another code besides their password, received for example by their mobile phone, to log in.
This can usually be set up in the security settings for your account or during the sign-up process. Two-step authentication is offered by Gmail, Hotmail, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, Facebook and Twitter among others.
Within minutes, Zed watched in horror as she was locked out of one account after another, as well as her Apple iCloud where she stored all her data - including a photo of her passport, bank details, and some explicit pictures. The hacker took control of all her IDs as they were all linked to the email address details she had supplied.
The scammer also activated an extra layer of security, called two-step authentication, meaning that they received all alerts about her accounts and could reset them.
Then a man called. The number had a Pakistan area code.
""He started the call by saying he didn't want any drama, he didn't want me to cry, he wanted me to talk to him like a professional,"" she said.
He sounded young, perhaps a college student, she thought.

He accused her of leading an ""immoral"" life. He had seen her photographs, he knew she had smoked and had boyfriends and was sexually active.
He asked her what her parents would think and was furious when she said they already knew.
""He claimed he had hacked thousands of women,"" Zed says.
""He said 10 or 12 he had felt bad about because he couldn't find anything about them that was 'wrong'.""
Zed was not part of that group.
""He said he was happy when he hacked my account. That I deserved everything.""
He told her he would post the explicit pictures on her Facebook page - where she has more than 1,000 friends.
""I offered him money. I asked if I could pay. He said, 'Don't talk about money.' He sounded irritated,"" she said.
Instead, he wanted her to perform a sex act for him on camera.
Zed refused.
""Either you do it for me or you do it for the whole world,"" he told her - and uploaded one of the photos to Facebook.
Zed had already warned her boyfriend and parents who assembled an army of friends waiting to report activity on her account. Within 15 minutes it had been disabled by Facebook - but she still received concerned messages from contacts.
""A friend who is like a brother sent me a message - it wasn't him who had seen [the photo] but a friend of his,"" she said.
""I feel like I mustn't think too much about how many people saw [the photos].""
The last thing the scammer said to her was, ""Have a great life.""
""It seemed to me the only reason he was doing this was to morally police women and get them to do stuff for him,"" Zed said.
""He wanted a gallery of explicit photographs of women. That seemed to be his motive.""
Zed does not consider herself to be digitally naive. She is a bright, articulate 20-something from India who works in the media industry on the US east coast.
""I have been tech savvy and on the internet almost my entire life - but I've never really seen the power of what people can do until now,"" she says.
Regaining control of her accounts has been a struggle. It took Zed a month to get her Apple ID back after engineers created a bespoke questionnaire for her containing answers that were not stored in her account.
Gmail and Facebook have also been restored, but she has lost Snapchat and her Hotmail address - her central account which she had used for more than 13 years.
""I feel for the poor woman - these scams are so easy to fall for,"" said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University.
""I think what it shows is that security is a combination of people, process and technology.  You can be very 'savvy' in any one or two of these but scammers are superb at finding novel combinations that, frankly, we just wouldn't think of.
""I know it sounds so obvious but, regardless of who they are, you should not share your username and password.  Give these scammers a small chink in the armour and they are sadly brilliant at getting in and running amok in your digital life.""
Zed still uses iCloud but does not store personal stuff on it anymore - and has activated two-step verification everywhere.
""I still see the value in the storage. But I will never ever give any information away again,"" she said.
Zed originally decided to share her story on community site Reddit after trying to find others who may have been conned by the same man.
""I was really shocked to discover that I found absolutely nothing,"" she said.
""I was hoping that speaking up about it would remedy that problem and encourage others to share their stories.
""It also felt like the only way to get back at him.""
As far as Zed knows, the scammer has not been caught.
""Cyber-criminals come in all shapes and sizes,' said prof Woodward.
""Their motive is not always monetary gain. As we have sadly seen of late, revenge or just being plain malicious is a growing trend.""",Yes
133,22,phishing,"Google Docs phishing email 'cost Minnesota $90,000'",8 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39845545,"A phishing email that targeted Gmail users is estimated to have cost the state of Minnesota $90,000 (Â£69,400).
About 2,500 state employees received the email, according to the state chief information security officer.
Around the world, people have reported getting multiple copies of the email, while others have received the message from trusted organisations.
One million Gmail users, which Google says is ""fewer than 0.1%"", were affected.
The cost to the Minnesota state government was mainly the result of employees dealing with the attack rather than carrying out their normal jobs, said state chief information security officer Christopher Buse.
""I estimated three minutes of time per employeeâ¦ it may be much more than that in many cases,"" he told ABC News.
""It's important for people to understand not only that the attacks are happening but also to understand how costly they are.""
Mr Buse said that the cost could have been much higher but Minnesota state government agencies generally did not use Gmail or Google Docs.
""Most of these scams are done using Office documents like Word and Excel spreadsheets"", Ken Munro, of Pen Test Partners, told the BBC.
""But a lot of big companies have moved away from traditional office software packages, and an increasing number are moving towards using Google.""
Besides the Minnesota state government, a large number of other Gmail users were affected.
Jacquelyn Piette, who is studying for an MBA at Boston College, tweeted that she had just received warning of the phishing scam when the message arrived in her inbox.
Users who received the email were told a contact of theirs had shared a document with them on Google Docs.
If they clicked on the ""Open in Docs"" button, they were taken to a genuine Google page that required them to log in with their account credentials.
Once logged in, a service called ""Google Apps"" would ask them for permission to access their email account data.
By agreeing to share their data, users were potentially giving the hackers access to their email account, contacts and online documents.
The malware used this access to send copies of the phishing email to everyone in the recipient's contacts list.
""As companies get better at security, scammers will start looking for connections between personal email accounts and professional accounts, which might sidestep some of the company's security,"" Mr Munro said.
He said that introducing ""layers of separation"" - such as not checking personal email on the office computer - could help prevent such phishing campaigns spreading.
""Companies could say they might not want you to check personal email on your work computer, but they don't mind you checking it on your mobile.""
Google said it had stopped the attack ""within approximately one hour"" and fewer than 0.1% of its users had been affected - about one million people.
Those who did click on the link have been advised to log into their accounts and revoke access to Google Apps, then change their password.",Yes
134,23,phishing,Google Docs users hit by phishing scam,4 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39798022,"Google says it has stopped a phishing email that reached about a million of its users.
The scam claimed to come from Google Docs - a service that allows people to share and edit documents online.
Users who clicked a link and followed instructions, risked giving the hackers access to their email accounts.
Google said it had stopped the attack ""within approximately one hour"", including through ""removing fake pages and applications"".
""While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed,"" Google said in an updated statement.
""There's no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup.""
During the attack, users were sent a deceptive invitation to edit a Google Doc, with a subject line stating a contact ""has shared a document on Google Docs with you"".
The email address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator[.]com was also copied in to the message; Mailinator, a free email service provider has denied any involvement.
If users clicked on the ""Open in Docs"" button in the email, they were then taken to a real Google-hosted page and asked to allow a seemingly real service, called ""Google Docs"", to access their email account data.
By granting permission, users unwittingly allowed hackers to potentially access to their email account, contacts and online documents.
The malware then e-mailed everyone in the victim's contacts list in order to spread itself.
""This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,"" Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU, told Reuters.
According to PC World magazine, the scam was more sophisticated than typical phishing attacks, whereby people trick people into handing over their personal information by posing as a reputable company.
This is because the hackers bypassed the need to steal people's login credentials and instead built a third-party app that used Google processes to gain account access.
The Russian hacking group Fancy Bear has been accused of using similar attack methods, but one security expert doubted their involvement.
""I don't believe they are behind this... because this is way too widespread,"" Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, told PC World.
Google said the spam campaign affected ""fewer than 0.1%"" of Gmail users. That works out to about one million people affected.
Last year, an American man pleaded guilty to stealing celebrities' nude pictures by using a phishing scam to hack their iCloud and Gmail accounts.
And in 2013, Google said it had detected thousands of phishing attacks targeting email accounts of Iranian users ahead of the country's presidential election.",Yes
135,24,phishing,Brazen fraudsters offer crime subscription service,23 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55424091,"Criminal organisations are offering subscription services to other fraudsters to teach them a scam in which they impersonate their victims.
Fraud prevention organisation Cifas said fraudsters were sharing tips and getting more sophisticated in their attempts to steal money.
Cases of a particular scam targeting shoppers, which often spikes at Christmas, have tripled this year.
Criminals harvest personal information then buy items in someone else's name.
The so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff.
Criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. Online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers.
Cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. This is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines.
Criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again.
There were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from January to September recorded by Cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019.
There was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones.
Cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies.
Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""We often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so I would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police.""
Last month, banking trade body UK Finance warned criminals were using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails.
These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses.

The addresses were then targeted in a series of phishing emails from ""a malicious third party"".
The messages invited recipients to click on a link to a Microsoft Word document containing malware.
DocuSign said that no other information was accessed in the incident, and the e-signature service remained secure.
""No names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed,"" the company said in a statement.
""DocuSign's core e-signature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure.""
The company has advised people to delete any suspicious messages immediately.
The breach came to light when the company noticed an increase in phishing emails sent to some of their account holders last week.
According to a statement published on DocuSign's website, ""a malicious third party gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email"".
The emails included the DocuSign branding and appeared to come from addresses ending ""docus.com"", a lookalike domain.
The subject line referred to either a wire transfer or an accounting invoice, saying: ""Document Ready for Signature"".
A full copy of the email has been published on the TechHelpList website, which reported that the malware contained in the attachment could be used to steal passwords and banking credentials.
""Phishing is almost the default way of tricking people into giving away that information,"" Keith Martin, professor of information security at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the BBC.
""Where it's targeting a bank, for example, the senders are going to use headers and language that'll make customers believe it's their bank.
""With a generic phishing trawl, the message will go out and the more people who click the better - it's literally like fishing, hoping to get some bites, chucking a message out there speculatively.

138,27,phishing,Coronavirus: Hackers targeted Covid vaccine supply 'cold chain',3 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55165552,"The international vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, according to IBM.
The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery ""cold chain"" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation.
The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state.
It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research.
IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020.
It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance.
Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions.
This sometimes requires a ""cold chain"".
For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about.
The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email.
They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials.
That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines.
""Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target,"" IBM says.
IBM says the wider targeting included:
IBM says the campaign was uncovered by a security team it set up at the start of the pandemic to track down Covid-19 cyber-threats.
""The precision targeting and nature of the specific targeted organisations potentially point to nation-state activity,"" the US company said.
""Without a clear path to a [pay]out, cyber-criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation.""
IBM says it has notified those targeted as well as law-enforcement authorities.
The US's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has issued an alert encouraging organisations associated with the storage and transport of a vaccine to be on guard for the kind of attacks linked to IBM's report.
In July, the UK warned Russian intelligence had targeted UK vaccine research, including at Oxford.
The US also warned of Chinese hacking, while, more recently, Microsoft said it had seen North Korean and Russian hackers targeting vaccine research.
Officials suggested the activity so far had been about intelligence gathering rather than disruption of any research.",Yes

Users took to social media to complain about the emails, which claim to be an order confirmation from the fast-food chain and contain links to malware.
The emails also use the victims' names, and appear to come from the chain's Subcard loyalty scheme.
Subway has not said whether its databases have been compromised or what the source of the scam is.
But the firm has acknowledged that there is a problem.
A spokesperson for the company said: ""We are aware of some disruption to our email systems and understand some of our guests have received an unauthorised email.""
It apologised for any inconvenience and advised people to delete the email.
The problem was earlier reported by computer security news site Bleeping Computer, which said it had found a form of malware called TrickBot in the malicious links the email encourages users to click.
Trickbot is designed to steal personal information from infected computers, and can also install other viruses and ransomware.
The email links to fake documents that supposedly need to be confirmed - including insurance documents for the sandwich, suggesting that the attack had been repurposed from an existing scam.
Bleeping Computer reports that these documents include an Excel spreadsheet download, which asks users to enable additional features that install the virus.
It is not clear how the attacker accessed the details of customers.
Online, some recipients claimed that the attack email appeared to come from the address that the company usually uses.
Update 12 December:
Subway has issued a fresh statement: ""Having investigated the matter, we have no evidence that guest accounts have been hacked. However, the system which manages our email campaigns has been compromised, leading to a phishing campaign that involved first name and email. The system does not hold any bank or credit card details. Crisis protocol was initiated and compromised systems locked down. The safety of our guests and their personal data is our overriding priority and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.""",Yes

The personal finance site Money Saving Expert says it is aware of students at major universities being targeted in a new wave of ""phishing emails"".
At Queen Mary University London, one student was tricked out of Â£300.
University of Glasgow said it was also aware of the scam and had advised students to ignore the email.
The mother of the QMUL student said her daughter had received the scam email last week.
It looked as if it had come from the university's finance department, complete with the logo, and invited the young woman to claim a government bursary.
An online form asked her for personal and banking details and took her to a bank verification page, which was when she became suspicious.
But, MSE says, the student found the fraudsters had already taken Â£300 from her bank account.
In a statement QMUL said: ""We were made aware late last week that a number of QMUL students had received these phishing emails.
""QMUL proactively monitors its systems to prevent and detect breaches, and there is no evidence to suggest any system has been compromised in this instance.
""A message was sent to all students warning them about the scam and providing them with advice on how they can protect themselves online, including details of our cybersecurity training courses.""
The university said it did not believe the scam had affected many students and said it was confident its own systems had not been breached.
The University of Glasgow said it would never ask for banking information in this way.
In an email to all students, the university said it had become aware of a scam email headed: ""Educational Grant Information"".
""This is an email message that appears as if it has come from the University of Glasgow's finance department. It has not,"" the university said.
Earlier this year, the police site Action Fraud warned of a similar ""phishing"" campaign at universities.
The Student Loans Company said students were particularly vulnerable to ""phishing"" attempts around the main payment dates, in September, January and April.
""Phishing emails are sent in batches so there will be more in circulation,"" it said.
""We want to remind students to stay vigilant with the details they provide online,"" said Paul Mason, the SLC director responsible for combating fraud.

141,30,phishing,Email 'most popular phishing tool',26 April 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36130407,"Cyber-thieves are sticking to email as their preferred way to trick victims into falling for scams, suggests a report.
The online crime groups were shunning mobiles and newer technologies in favour of phishing campaigns, said the report from Verizon.
The annual analysis catalogues more than 100,000 security incidents that hit thousands of companies in 2015.
Almost 90% of the incidents involved attempts to steal cash, it said.
The gangs were sticking to booby-trapped emails because they were proving increasingly effective, said Marc Spitler, lead author on the report.
And, so far, there was little evidence novel technologies involving net-connected gadgets or smartphones were becoming a popular attack route.
About 30% of phishing emails had been opened by people in targeted organisations in 2015, said the report, up from 23% in 2014.
And, of the scam emails opened, about 13% had been able to launch malware because staff had run the attachments they had carried.
This meant, said Mr Spitler, it often took just minutes for criminals to compromise the network of a targeted company.
""If an attack works, then it works very quickly,"" he said.
""The phishing email typically leads to the installation of malware or the compromise of a user's PC by some sort of malicious code that can establish control or persistence on a network,"" said Mr Spitler.
Unfortunately, he added, although companies fell victim quickly, they could take far longer to notice they had been breached.
Statistics gathered for the Verizon report suggest 84% of the organisations questioned took weeks to spot that criminals had won access to internal systems.",Yes

Members of the BBC Radio 4's You and Yours team were among those who received the scam emails, claiming they owed hundreds of pounds to UK firms.
The firms involved have been inundated with phone calls from worried members of the public.
One security expert warned clicking on the link would install malware.
You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl was one of the first on the team to receive an email.
""The email has good spelling and grammar and my exact home address...when I say exact I mean, not the way my address is written by those autofill sections on web pages, but the way I write my address.
""My tummy did a bit of a somersault when I read that, because I wondered who on earth I could owe Â£800 to and what was about to land on my doormat.""
She quickly realised it was a scam and did not click on the link.
""Then, a couple of minutes later, You and Yours producer Jon Douglas piped up as he'd received one and then another colleague said he'd received one too, but to his home email address,"" she added.
The You and Yours team decided to contact the companies that were listed in the emails as being owed money.
A spokesman for British Millerain Co Ltd, a waxed cotton fabric manufacturer, told the programme that the firm ""had more than 150 calls from people who don't owe us money"".
And a spokeswoman for Manchester shelving firm Greenoaks said: ""My colleague took a call from an elderly gentleman and he was very distressed because his wife had had one of these emails.""
Dr Steven Murdoch, principal research fellow at the department of computer science at University College London, told You and Yours: ""Most likely it was a retailer or other internet site that had been hacked into and the database stolen, it then could have been sold or passed through several different people and then eventually it got to the person who sent out these emails.""
He said that the email bore the hallmark of previous phishing attempts from gangs in Eastern Europe and Russia.
He said that clicking on the link would install malware such as Cryptolocker, which is a form of ransomware that will encrypt files on Windows-based computers and then demand a fee to unlock them.

An invoice for Â£170 was sent to subscribers to the Scotland Supporters Club mailing list just after 09:00.
The email - addressed ""Dear Customer"" - provided a link for payment, which was a disguised website address.
The SFA said a third-party email database had been compromised and urged recipients to delete the email.

144,33,phishing,Phishing catches victims 'in minutes',14 April 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32285433,"It takes 82 seconds for cyber-thieves to ensnare the first victim of a phishing campaign, a report suggests.
Compiled by Verizon, the report looks at analyses of almost 80,000 security incidents that hit thousands of companies in 2014.
It found that, in many companies, about 25% of those who received a phishing email were likely to open it.
""Training your employees is a critical element of combating this threat,"" said Bob Rudis, lead author on the report.
Tricking people into opening a booby-trapped message let attackers grab login credentials that could be used to trespass on a network and steal data, the report said.
""They do not have to use complex software exploits, because often they can get hold of legitimate credentials,"" Mr Rudis said.
Analysis of data breaches found that, in many cases, it had taken less than two minutes for freshly sent phishing emails to catch their first victim. And, said Mr Rudis, half of the victims had clicked on the message within the first hour of it being sent.
Although attackers racked up victims quickly, it took companies far longer to notice they had been compromised, Mr Rudis said.
The report also found companies could take straight-forward steps to defend themselves against well-crafted phishing emails designed to make people open them and their attachments.
Teaching staff to spot bogus messages could reduce the proportion of victims to sent emails from one in four to one in 20, he said.
Showing workers the tell-tale signs of a phishing email could also turn them into another line of defence that could catch messages missed by automatic detection systems.
""They should be treating employees as tools in the fight rather than as lambs to the slaughter,"" Mr Rudis said.
After phishing, some cyber-thieves relied on companies running un-patched software that was vulnerable to old and well-known exploits, he said.
More than 99% of the vulnerabilities exploited in data breaches had been known about for more than a year, Mr Rudis said. And some had been around for a decade.
""There are some vulnerabilities that just linger out there,"" he said.
A good patching regime would help companies protect themselves against most of the vulnerabilities cyber-thieves abuse, Mr Rudis added.

146,35,phishing,Tech Tent: Hacking the heart of the US government,18 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55363828,"Since March, hackers have had access to key parts of the US government - and only in the last week has their presence been uncovered.
On Tech Tent we assess the damage done by what may be the most successful act of cyber-espionage yet seen.
It was last Sunday when it emerged that a company called SolarWinds had been hacked and its customers were being advised to disconnect from one of its key products, the Orion Platform, used to monitor networks.
I'm sure many people yawned and thought this was just another hack but to cyber-security experts the name of the company targeted was a red flag. ""The moment I heard SolarWinds was involved, the alarm bells went off,"" Rick Holland, chief information security officer at Digital Shadows, tells Tech Tent.
That was because customers of SolarWinds network monitoring tools include many branches of the US government. ""You have the highest tiers of both the military side of the government, as well as the civilian agencies in the government, as well.""
Through the week it seemed each day brought news of another key agency whose defences had been breached since the attackers tampered with an update to the SolarWinds Orion platform.
The Departments of Treasury and Commerce were named first, then Homeland Security, the National Institute of Health and even the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab were said to have been compromised.
At an early stage Reuters news agency said three sources had told it Russia was behind the attack - an allegation the Russian Foreign Ministry described as baseless.
The US government has been cautious about attributing the attack to the Russians, although the FBI has said it is investigating ""in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors"".
In the New York Times on Thursday President Trump's former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, was clear about who he thinks is responsible. ""The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate,"" he wrote. ""The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.""
But whoever did it, how did they manage to get through the defences of a company like SolarWinds with what the company describes as a "" very sophisticated supply-chain attack""?
Rick Holland has a theory: ""We do know that SolarWinds, in their filing to the Security and Exchange Commission this week, alluded to Microsoft, which makes me think that the initial access into the SolarWinds environment was through a phishing email. So someone clicked on something they thought was benign -  turned out it was not benign.""
If it did all start with a phishing email, that won't sound too sophisticated to many people.
But in a blog post, calling for a global response to what he describes as a moment of reckoning, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, says his own company's investigations confirm that this was an attack ""remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact"".
While not attributing the attack to Russia in so many words, he notes the country's involvement in previous hacks and calls this latest one ""an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world"".
Much of the language used about this attack by both American government officials and private companies sounds like that used during periods of tension during the Cold War. But so far, the man who leads the United States has been silent.
President Trump was swift in sacking US cyber-security chief Chris Krebs after he described the November election as the most secure in American history. But he has not said a word about what looks like the modern equivalent of an armed raid on the United States mainland by a foreign power.",Yes

Icann, which administers the net's addressing system, said spoofed emails were used to reach an internal network.
The attackers used this access to steal lists of contact and login information for people who control some of the net's most popular domains.
Icann said it had notified people that their data may have gone astray and asked them to change their passwords.
Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, was set up to oversee the underlying addressing system that keeps the net running and ensures data gets where it is supposed to go.
In a blogpost, Icann said some of its staff were tricked into opening booby-trapped email messages sent by attackers that were crafted to look like they came from other employees.
The attack took place in late November and Icann realised it had been attacked about a week later.
The booby-trapped emails helped the attackers capture login name and password details for Icann's internal network that attackers then used to snoop around the organisation's systems.
An investigation by Icann revealed that the attackers got at a system called the Centralised Zone Data System (CZDS) that lists who looks after what is known as generic top-level domains. This includes the widely used .com, .info, .net and .org domains as well as a host of other more recently established domains.
Icann said it was not possible to alter any details of who administers these domains from its CZDS system.
Passwords were stored in a hard to crack format, said Icann, and added it had deactivated passwords so those with legitimate access to CZDS would have to generate a new one.
""Based on our investigation to date, we are not aware of any other systems that have been compromised,"" it said, adding that it had now put in place more stringent security systems to prevent another breach.",Yes

The man had not booked any such flight. While no money was taken from him, he was asked to click on links to confirm the flight.
BA has warned the email is an attempt to get people's personal details.
The airline said it had been contacted by a number of customers on Monday who had received such an email.
BA said other examples of fake emails included:
The airline said the emails are not from British Airways, but are attempts to secure personal information or extort money from consumers.
""Legitimate emails from British Airways will contain your booking reference and the email will not have been sent from a web-based mail server such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc,"" BA said.
""In addition, British Airways will never request money payments through a third party or promise you any kind of cash prize.""

151,40,phishing,Mass phishing attack launched against dating sites,19 June 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27922710,"Fraudsters are stepping up phishing campaigns that target people who use dating websites, suggests research.
Members of Match.com, eHarmony, Zoosk, Christian Mingle and many others had received emails seeking to steal login details for the sites, said Netcraft.
The net monitoring firm said the emails had been sent from other websites, hacked to hide the senders' identity.
Stolen data would be used to befriend other users in an attempt to trick them into handing over cash, it said.
The phishing campaign against dating sites marked a departure for fraudsters, who typically preferred to target banks, said Paul Mutton, a security analyst at Netcraft who investigated the attacks.
The attacks were ""massive"", he said, adding that in the past week Netcraft had seen more than 100 compromised sites targeting Match.com alone.
So far, he said, it was not clear how sites were being compromised to host the scripts. Websites and servers run by individuals, small businesses, construction firms and telecom suppliers had all become unwitting hosts of the phishing tools, he added.
Mr Mutton said just one compromised site he had seen was home to about 800 short programs or scripts that targeted many different dating sites. Each script looked like it had been generated by a ""kit"" bought online.
""Anyone with a very basic knowledge of programming could make use of the kit,"" he said.
The scripts are used to craft phishing emails that are spammed out to potential victims.
The mails seek to trick people into entering their login names for the dating sites.
If successful, the details are passed on to the legitimate login page of a dating website and are also sent to one of 300 email addresses used by the phishing gang.
Fraudsters were keen to steal login details for accounts so they could avoid paying the charges dating sites levied before users could swap messages with other members, said Mr Mutton.
Using on-site messages the fraudsters hope to befriend others and then try to extract cash to help pay for a non-existent medical condition or to aid fictitious relatives.
Significant amounts of cash could be stolen this way, said Mr Mutton, pointing to the case of Karen and Tracy Vasseur, of Colorado, who were jailed in 2013 for stealing more than $1m (Â£590,000) from 374 people using dating-site scams.",Yes

153,42,phishing,Bitcoin investors: From buying a Bentley to losing it all,9 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55996412,"Bitcoin has soared to trade at an eye-watering $48,000 (Â£34,820), following the news that Tesla has bought $1.5bn of the crypto-currency.
Enthusiasts will tell you it's the future of money - but investing in the notoriously volatile virtual currency can be a rollercoaster, and it's not without risk. The hunt for new coins, using powerful computers, is also causing a surge in energy demand - which is not so good for the environment.
Here are some of your Bitcoin adventures.
James Saye, tech consultant
I first invested in Bitcoin in 2017 - I was nervous about putting too much in, so I went for around Â£500.
I cashed it in for Â£2,500 during one of its peaks, and had a great holiday in Iceland - the cash came in handy, Iceland is lovely but expensive.
I bought in again in 2018 when the price was lower so I'm still in but I don't regret cashing out when I did.
Heather Delaney, founder of Gallium Ventures
I've been the silent crypto-investor. I put in Â£5 at the very beginning and I've built it slowly and steadily over time. I see it as a long-term strategy, meaning the rapid highs and lows are not ones that cause me anxiety - although ask me as I near my retirement and we shall see what I think then!
Based on how much I have invested in Bitcoin over time versus what I see today, I have a 585.41% increase in my investment.
I've never cashed it out - but I have converted some to other currencies as the market has fluctuated.
I know loads of people who have done exciting things with their investments but for me it's part of my pension plan. I know I'm not typical.
David Stubley, founder of 7 Elements cyber-security firm
We had a client whose Bitcoin wallet was fraudulently accessed and all the money was transferred out of it. He had intended to use it as a deposit on a house.
The man had been spooked by reports of fluctuations in the currency and decided to check his wallet. But he clicked on a fraudulent link, which led him to a phishing site, a complete clone of the real thing.
He had 84 bitcoins, and the fraudsters transferred 83 of them. At the time, in 2017, they were worth $475,000.
We tracked the payment on the blockchain [a kind of shared digital public ledger] - we could see it rolling across various wallets and finally it reached a wallet containing $15m of currency.
While the final identity of the fraudsters could not be identified, we were able to have the wallets frozen, so at least denying access to the stolen funds.
Our client was irate but philosophical. Today, that stolen Bitcoin would be worth Â£2.8m.
Once it's gone, it really has gone.
Javed Khan, independent trader
My Bitcoin journey didn't start as an investment. At first, it was a form of transferring money, I didn't have to wait for confirmation from banks and so on - it was convenient.
In 2018, I noticed I'd make a transfer, leave some Bitcoin in my wallet and I'd see the prices go up - and before I knew it I was seeing profit, which surprised me. I had been telling my friends I was using it as a transfer tool, I hadn't thought about investing in it.
In January 2020, I cashed in my Bitcoin profits and bought a Bentley in Dubai, where I now live. I sent a video from the showroom to my mum and she cried, she was really proud.
I would only put in money that I could afford to lose. The most I've lost is the transaction fees - when the price drops I don't lose faith.
I think the best time to buy Bitcoin is when nobody's talking about it - wait for the hype to die down.
Rohan Muscat, project manager and electrical engineer
I became aware of Bitcoin in 2010, but being a bit of a hardware geek, I wanted to mine it. In late 2016 I bought a pair of graphics cards to mine, and at first I did pretty well with it.
A start-up I'd done some consulting for gave me some Horizon State tokens (another form of crypto-currency) to pay part of my way, and in January 2017 those plus my mined assets were worth A$40,000 (Â£22,000).
I decided to trade it a bit, and investigated bots while moving to bigger scale mining.
At first it paid for itself, but then it went downhill and was borderline break-even. My electricity bill shot up to A$500-A$600 a month, because the mining rig needed so much power.
I ended up selling the mining gear, and I'm currently sitting on about A$2,000 in crypto.
I could have made more if I'd jumped in and out, but the emotions and risks in trading have burnt me, and I'd rather not take the risk.
Daniel Crocker, business owner
In 2012, I was doing an apprenticeship at an IT company. At lunchtime we used to chat about little ways of making money on the side. Nobody had really heard of Bitcoin but we decided to give it a go and we spent a few weeks on it.
It didn't last long, but luckily I kept hold of mine.
I traded them in last summer and got half the deposit for my house. I've still got a little bit but I'm just going to sit tight - it's not something I want to pin my future on.
I do know people who have gone in deep but I think I've been lucky enough already.",Yes
154,43,phishing,Google blocking 18m coronavirus scam emails every day,17 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52319093,"Scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to Gmail users every day, according to Google.
The tech giant says the pandemic has led to an explosion of phishing attacks in which criminals try to trick users into revealing personal data.
The company said it was blocking more than 100 million phishing emails a day. Over the past week, almost a fifth were scam emails related to coronavirus.
The virus may now be the biggest phishing topic ever, tech firms say.
Google's Gmail is used by 1.5 billion people.
Individuals are being sent a huge variety of emails which impersonate authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), in an effort to persuade victims to download software or donate to bogus causes.
Cyber-criminals are also attempting to capitalise on government support packages by imitating public institutions.
Google claims that its machine-learning tools are able to block more than 99.9% of emails from reaching its users.
The growth in coronavirus-themed phishing is being recorded by several cyber-security companies.
Barracuda Networks said it had seen a 667% increase in malicious phishing emails during the pandemic.
Scammers have been sending fake emails and text messages claiming to be from the UK government, the WHO, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and even individual US officials, including President Trump.
""Phishing attacks always share the common trait of inciting or depending on an emotion that causes us to act more hastily or think less about our actions at that moment in time,"" said independent security researcher Scott Helme.
""The coronavirus pandemic is a highly emotional topic right now and cyber-criminals clearly know this. They're hoping that the typical person might be more inclined to click through links or follow bad instructions if they use this lure.""
Researchers have also found malicious websites and smartphone applications based on genuine coronavirus resources.
One malicious Android app claims to help track the spread of the virus, but instead infects the phone with ransomware and demands payment to restore the device.
Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre and the US Department of Homeland Security issued a joint advisory.
They said they had seen ""an increasing number of malicious cyber-actors"" that were ""exploiting the current Covid-19 pandemic for their own objectives"".

They asked teachers at Schoenbar Middle School, for 12 to 13-year-olds, to enter admin names and passwords to accept a false software update, according to reports.
The pupils used those details to access and control classmates' PCs.
Classmates then complained that their computers were not responding normally.
Associated Press said that at least 18 pupils were involved in the phishing, which gave them control over 300 computers allocated for student use at the school in the Alaskan town of Ketchikan.
Those computers have now been seized.
""I don't believe any hardware issues were compromised,"" Casey Robinson, the principal, told community radio station Ketchikan FM.
He said: ""No software issues were compromised. I don't think there was any personal information compromised. Now that we have all the machines back in our control, nothing new can happen.""
Mr Robinson added there would be a review of the way that devices are maintained.
""How we do business is definitely going to have to change when it comes to updating programs and resources that we have on the machines,"" Mr Robinson said.

Victims received emails inviting them to update details on their student account via a link to a bogus website.
The Metropolitan Police's e-Crime unit was first alerted in August 2011 and worked with the Student Loans Company, the banking industry and internet service providers during their investigation.
Officers have now seized computers and other equipment from addresses in London, Manchester and Bolton.

157,46,phishing,Covid: Police pressure as pandemic changes 'landscape of crime',3 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55921350,"Unprecedented changes in lifestyle in the coronavirus pandemic led to an acceleration in shifts in criminal behaviour in Wales, a crime expert has said.
Levels of reported crime fell across Wales from October 2019-2020, including in the first few months of the pandemic.
But figures show reports of cyber crime, stalking and harassment spiked.
Professor Martin Innes said challenges were ""unprecedented"" in modern times.
The Cardiff University professor said while it was hard to predict the future, an increase in digital crime during the pandemic, teamed with the economic impact and increases in social tension mixed for a ""worrying cocktail"" for post-lockdown crime.
Police forces across Wales have repeatedly warned of being under immense pressure during the pandemic as they try to enforce Covid laws while dealing with serious and violent crime.
Recent figures, released by the Office of National Statistics, show 245,591 crimes were reported to Welsh police forces between October 2019 and September 2020, a 7% fall on the year before, although this does not include fraud figures.
The number of fraud offences increased by 8% to 14,845 during the same period.
While the number of burglaries (-18%), thefts (-22%) and shoplifting offences fell between September 2019-2020, stalking and harassment reports increased by 11% in Wales, with 36,770 reports.
Domestic abuse charities also reported marked increases in calls for help when schools returned in September after abuse was not reported during lockdown.
Prof Innes, director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University, said crime had been shifting for years, but lockdown had seemed to accelerated rates of personal and digital crime, as people were stuck at home and spending more time online.
Dyfed-Powys Police saw the largest increase in reports of stalking and harassment offences, with 5,229 reports a 34% increase compared to the year before.
In North Wales police reported an increase in stalking and harassment crimes, as well as a rise in disability and transphobic hate crime.
While the coronavirus pandemic has seen many acts of kindness, police have warned some criminals have used Covid-19 to scam people out of their life savings.
Figures, published by Action Fraud, show victims of cyber crime and fraud in Wales have reportedly lost Â£35.4m, with almost 13,000 crimes reported since the start of lockdown on 23 March.
Health officials and police have warned scammers claiming to work for the NHS are targeting vulnerable people online offering fake Covid vaccines in return for cash or personal details.
Dyfed-Powys Police also reported a significant increase in romance fraud, with victims in west Wales losing Â£1.3m between January and November last year, with officers saying criminals are targeting the lonely in lockdown.
Prof Innes said the shift to cyber, such as online hate crime, drug dealing over apps, and smear campaigns, was a huge challenge for forces and they would need to invest in expertise and technology to be able to recover evidence.
He said the impact of the pandemic on drug trade, and gang operations like County Lines, was concerning, as criminal operations would have changed.
""Just like everybody else has changed their behaviour in the pandemic, those involved in drug behaviour have probably done the same... and probably some of those innovations they've made will stick.""
At a recent North Wales Police and Crime panel Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said that officers were predicting an increase in ""digital cyber criminality"" and it would be a ""complex and challenging"" area for the future.
South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael warned ""increased levels of serious violence and domestic abuse were likely to continue"" following the pandemic.
In a report to the South Wales Police and Crime Panel, Mr Michael said: ""The scale of the economic downturn and subsequent rate of recovery will fundamentally shape the post pandemic crime and disorder landscape in the medium to long term.""
He added: ""People are spending more time online - increasing the risk of phishing, grooming, cyber attacks and sextortion.
""Payment preferences are also shifting to increasingly be online which again opens up opportunities for online fraud.""
Meanwhile reports of public order offences also increased across all four forces by 8%, with Dyfed-Powys Police recording an increase of 29% during the year to September 2020.
In Dyfed-Powys and Gwent Police areas, documents show the forces said crime had increased after lockdown measures were first eased in summer 2020.
In Gwent reports of sexual offences increased by 29% (from 128 to 126), but remained significantly lower than normal with the force saying less people were reporting the crime, while bike thefts increased by 25%, due to ""cycling being encouraged...during lockdown"".
In the Dyfed-Powys area drug offences increased during the first lockdown in March, before decreasing significantly later in 2020.
The force warned that public tensions remained high due to Covid restrictions, and this had led to the number of reports of public order offences remaining high.
There had been ""exponential"" increases in anti-social behaviour reports due to breaches of lockdown rules, it said.
In July and August, when restrictions began to ease, there was a sharp rise in violent attacks, but the force said this was down to an ""increase in alcohol related"" incidents.
In North Wales, by the start of December, officers had issued 582 fines for Covid-19 restriction breaches, with two Â£10k fines issued for illegal music events.
Prof Innes said when lockdown measures were eased again, anti-social behaviour and low level public disorder could spike in communities, and with people struggling due to losing their jobs, crime levels would return to pre-pandemic levels.
""People have been cooped up and there won't be an awful lot of things for people to do as the weather gets nicer,"" he said.
""We can already see some of the social tensions kind of bubbling away when you look across Europe.
""Longer term we are going to see a lot of empty shops and town centres are going to be very different than they have been... what we know is when you've got empty stores they act as a magnet for trouble.""",Yes
158,47,phishing,'Nightclub bouncer' phishing scam found by researchers,17 January 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21058591,"Cyber-criminals have invented a cunning new method of targeting victims by developing a system that behaves like a bouncer at an exclusive nightclub.
Security firm RSA revealed how attackers assigned targets with a unique ID, meaning the scam could be aimed at specific people.
If a person's ID was not on the list, their computer would not be affected.
RSA said the advanced threat posed a new ""detection challenge"" to the security industry.
In a blog post, RSA cybercrime specialist Limor Kessem wrote: ""As we adapt and improve our detection systems, we are reminded that in the never-ending cat-and-mouse game, only the nimble will survive.""
The so-called Bouncer Phishing Kit targets preset lists of email addresses. For each target, a unique ID is automatically generated, creating a unique web address for the user to click on.
If someone has an ID that does not match the list of intended targets, they will simply be presented with a 404 Error page, and will be unharmed.
If, however, a person is one of the unfortunate ones, the same page will instead spring into life as an ""attack page"" ready to steal user credentials.
Using this method means attackers can harvest data from certain groups of users, rather than having to sift through large amounts of data.
For example, the Bouncer Phishing Kit could be used to gather personal details on people in one particular country.
""It holds this [bouncer] moniker because much like many high-profile night-time hotspots - if your name is not on the list, you're staying out,"" Mr Kessem said.
""Traditional phishers like to cast as wide of a net as possible.
""But with this tactic the phisher is laser-focusing the campaign in an effort to collect only the most pertinent credentials for his purposes.
""Keeping out uninvited guests also means avoiding security companies and prompt take-downs of such attacks.""
Phishing is a growing problem for internet users. According to RSA's data, attacks of this type were up 59% in 2012 compared with the previous year, and cost the global economy $1.5bn (Â£940m).",Yes
159,48,phishing,Singles Day: The world's biggest shopping event luring scammers,11 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-54898680,"Singles Day, the world's biggest online shopping event, has kicked off with consumers estimated to spend billions of dollars - much of which is being eyed by scammers.
This year's event is expected to continue to break records across Asia, as more people stay home and shop online amid the Covid-19 pandemic, while those unable to travel overseas for shopping trips are expected to ""revenge spend"" online.
It represents a huge honeypot for scammers who, over the years, have come up with increasingly innovative ways to trick consumers, from creating fake apps to claims of formaldehyde-soaked clothes.
Some shoppers in China have lost tens of thousands of dollars to such ruses.
Authorities from several provinces including Anhui, Jiangsu and Sichuan have issued warnings on social media platform Weibo about a ""fake refund"" phone scam.
How it works: a person impersonating a customer service officer from an e-commerce site phones the victim to inform him that a recent purchase is either out of stock or damaged, and that as compensation they will give him a refund that is more than the amount that he paid.
He then asks the victim for bank account details so that he can ""process the refund"".
Police say they have already seen many such instances in the past few weeks during pre-Singles Day sales.
A woman in Yunnan province recently lost a total of 200,000 yuan ($30,000; Â£22,900) recently after she was tricked into believing that she would be getting a refund on 200 yuan worth of clothes that she bought on e-commerce platform Taobao.
She had transferred money to scammers multiple times after being told that there were problems with their system, and that she had to pay to unfreeze her account.
The ""fake refund"" scam has seen various iterations over the years.
In 2018, scammers reportedly posed as customer service officers offering refunds on clothes said to be ruined by excessive formaldehyde. One woman in Wuxi city lost 44,000 yuan ($7,000) this way, after she scanned a QR code sent by a scammer which asked for her bank details.
Last year, the formaldehyde scam was tweaked to trick mothers into believing that the chemical had tainted their orders of baby diapers.
Other scams involve counterfeit shopping apps, which are made to look and function like those by retailers such as Taobao and JD.com. As they look so similar to the real deal, victims are tricked into giving away personal information such as mobile numbers and bank account details.
According to a 2018 report by Chinese online security firm 360 Security Brain, close to 4,000 fake shopping apps were downloaded on more than 300,000 mobile devices in China in November that year.
There have also been reports of fraud related to cash-on-delivery packages, where confused family members are asked to pay cash upfront when signing for delivered packages to their door.
Singles Day is the world's biggest online shopping event in terms of spending, with much of the revenue generated by Chinese online retail giant Alibaba.
Last year, their gross merchandise value on Singles Day reached more than 210bn yuan (Â£23bn, US$31bn), which is double that of Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. This year, Alibaba is claiming to have hit 372bn yuan of sales within the first 30 minutes of the event including pre-Singles Day orders.
Originally created by the company as a Chinese shopping festival, it's now expanded across the region with other online retailers in countries such as Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines all holding their own versions.
Also known as Double 11 as it is held annually on 11 Nov,  the shopping festival offers buyers huge discounts on everything from household items and fashion accessories, to cars and even houses.
The huge number of transactions during this period presents scammers with ample opportunities, and e-commerce fraudulent activities saw ""significant growth"" during the sales period across Asian countries last year, according to data by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.
Mr Yeo Siang Tiong, general manager for South East Asia, said victims often fall prey to scams on Singles Day because they get ""caught up in the excitement"" while trying to get the best deals.
""In addition, many of the phishing scams in particular have become quite convincing, making it hard for consumers to differentiate between truth and fiction,"" he said.
Never give away critical personal information such as bank account details over the phone. E-commerce platforms such as Taobao would typically have a customer's bank information already saved in their system, so refunds should be able to be processed automatically.
Fake refund scams also often offer you more than what you paid for, which would rarely happen in a real situation. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
As for Internet phishing scams, double check web addresses if you are redirected to them from other landing pages, said Kaspersky's Mr Yeo, or try to access deal pages directly through the legitimate website.",Yes

People looking for games consoles, bicycles and clothing may be at a higher risk of encountering a scam, according to banking industry research.
UK Finance, which represents the finance industry, warned of scams when items were never delivered.
The average loss in such cases was Â£720 in the first half of the year.
The trade body said social media platforms, online marketplaces and auction websites were increasingly being used by criminals to carry out these purchase scams, where a customer pays in advance for goods or services that do not exist and are never received.
These payments are taken off the integrated payment platform and are made through a bank transfer instead, and mean people are unlikely to be refunded.
More than Â£27m was lost to such fraud in the first half of the year, according to UK Finance figures.
It also warned that purchase scams may also involve home improvement and DIY purchases such as patio heaters and sheds, as fraudsters adapted to more people staying at home.
Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said: ""As consumer spending has shifted online, criminals have ruthlessly adjusted their approaches to pursue those shopping on the internet.
""With Black Friday and Christmas approaching, fraudsters are again stepping up their efforts to take advantage of consumers searching for bargains.""
UK Finance data shows that 25 to 34-year-olds are most likely to shop online regularly.
Ms Worobec said criminals were also using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails.
These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses.
The first UK-wide lockdown led to reports of rising numbers of scam and fraud attempts.
Figures from Barclays suggested fraud attempts in general were up 66% in the first half of the year compared with the previous six months.

161,50,phishing,Google detects Iran phishing attacks ahead of election,13 June 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22884006,"Google says it has detected and stopped thousands of phishing attacks targeting email accounts of Iranian users ahead of the 14 June presidential election.
In an online statement, the firm said it had noticed a ""significant jump"" in the region's overall volume of phishing activity in the last three weeks.
The timing and targets suggested the attacks were ""politically motivated"".
Friday's poll is the first since 2009 when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a controversial second term.
The election had triggered angry protests, with voters accusing Mr Ahmadinejad's camp of rigging the results in his favour.
Google's vice-president of security engineering, Eric Grosse, said the phishing attacks originated from within Iran.
Phishing attempts to obtain passwords and other private computing information by directing users to fake websites.
""For almost three weeks, we have detected and disrupted multiple email-based phishing campaigns aimed at compromising the accounts owned by tens of thousands of Iranian users,"" he said.
""The timing and targeting of the campaigns suggest that the attacks are politically motivated in connection with the Iranian presidential election on Friday.""
Mr Grosse said victims targeted in the attacks had received an email containing a link to a web page purporting to perform account maintenance.
If they clicked the link, they were taken to a fake Google sign-in page, which would steal their username and password.
The threat was detected by a phishing detection feature added to the firm's Chrome web browser in 2012.
Mr Grosse warned Iranian users to take extra measures to protect their accounts from ""state-sponsored attacks"".
In the latest case, users received a message which appeared to come from Google itself using the official-looking address: email.settings@gmail.com.
It suggested they assign an extra email address to their existing Google account to make password recovery easier.
The bogus link they were asked to click also contained the search firm's name adding to the appearance of authenticity, Google says.
However, the attempt was spotted by a Safe Browsing feature added to Google's Chrome browser last year.
Most of the six candidates in Friday's election are conservatives close to Ayatollah Khamenei.
The opposition says more than 80 of its supporters were killed in a crackdown over a period of six months after the 2009 election - a figure the government disputes. Several have been sentenced to death, and dozens jailed.

""We see workers being tricked into downloading viruses from hackers demanding ransoms, and we have even had employees sent WhatsApp messages pretending to be from the CEO, asking for money transfers.
""And having staff working from home during the lockdowns has just made it worse, as it is much harder to keep an eye on everyone.""
With one in three UK workers currently based exclusively at home, and the same level in the US, this remote working on a vast scale continues to be a major headache for the IT security bosses of companies large and small around the world.
And studies shows that many firms are not taking the issue as seriously as they should. For example, one in five UK home workers has received no training on cyber-security, according to a recent survey by legal firm Hayes Connor Solicitors.
The report also found that two out of three employees who printed potentially sensitive work documents at home admitted to putting the papers in their bins without shredding them first.
Meanwhile, a separate UK study last year found that 57% of IT decision makers believe that remote workers will expose their firm to the risk of a data breach.
""In the rush and panic to set remote working practices up, even simple data protection practices were ignored,"" says Christine Sabino, a senior associate at Hayes Connor.
""Companies did not provide additional security relating to computers, electronic communication, phone communication.""
So what can both companies and home working staff do to make things as safe and secure as possible?
Ted Harrington, a San Diego-based cyber-security specialist, and author of Hackable: How To Do Application Security Right, says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop. While many larger companies may well have done this, not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so, but Mr Harrington stresses its importance.
""Supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned, controlled and configured by the company,"" he says. ""This alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right, and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants.""
Definitely don't have staff using their personal computers for work, says Sam Grubb, an Arkansas-based cyber-security consultant, and author of forthcoming book How Cybersecurity Really Works.
""The main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it, nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it,"" he says.
""So while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free, your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing.
""This makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen. This might affect the work you are doing, or in a worst-case scenario, lead to the compromise of co-workers' devices, or other company devices such as servers.""
Mr Harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a VPN or virtual private network, so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firm's servers and everyone else in the company.
Mr Grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how VPNs work. ""A VPN is like a tunnel between two cities,"" he says.
""Instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers, lions and bears, you drive through the underground tunnel, where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side.""
However, even with work laptops, VPNs and the latest cyber-security software systems in place, staff can still make damaging mistakes, such as falling prey to a ""phishing"" email - a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data.
Currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to Covid-19, or invited to have the vaccine. They ask the recipient to clink on the link, which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
For this reason, both Mr Harrington and Mr Grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cyber-security training.
""Firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face,"" says Mr Grubb.
Ms Sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit. She says, for example, that employees should avoid talking about work on social media, while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out.
With even the most cyber-security aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake, Mr Harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to.
""If an employee falls victim to an attack, make sure that they know a) who to contact, and b) that their outreach is welcome and won't result in termination,"" he says. ""You don't want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes.""
Tsedal Neeley, a professor of business administration from Harvard Business School who is an expert on remote working, agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cyber-security problems to. ""Engaging with their firm's IT/cyber-security experts is crucial,"" she says.
Peter, the computer network manager, says this engagement should be frequent. ""Users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100% confident about, and it does not hurt to ask your IT department. It is better to check than be compromised.""",Yes
164,53,phishing,Coronavirus: How hackers are preying on fears of Covid-19,13 March 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51838468,"Security experts say a spike in email scams linked to coronavirus is the worst they have seen in years.
Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance.
Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found.
The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns.
Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments.
The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time.
""We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click,"" says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team.
Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day.
""It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals,"" says Ms DeGrippo.
The best way to see where a link will take you is to hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal the true web address. If it looks dodgy, don't click.
Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours.
If a member of the public clicked on ""access your funds now"", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information.
""Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email,"" says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. ""And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund.""
Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread.
""This little measure can save you,"" they claim.
But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger.
This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online.
To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice.
The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission.
It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool.
Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers ""weaponising fear and panic"".
It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic.  Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account.
Cofense says the combination of a ""rather good forgery"" and a ""high stress situation"" make for a potent trap.
One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account.
This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing.
Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware.
""We expect the numbers to grow, of course, as the real virus continues to spread,"" says David Emm, principal security researcher at the firm.",Yes

167,56,phishing,EA games web server hacked to host phishing website now fixed,20 March 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13846031,"A web server belonging to the games company Electronic Arts which had been hacked and was hosting a phishing website, has now been fixed.
The website that was put in place by hackers asked users to enter their Apple IDs - the credentials needed to access services like Apple's iTunes.
A second screen then asked users to enter further personal information, including credit card details.
EA said the problem had been found and hacking attempts had been stopped.
Paul Mutton, from Netcraft, the internet security company that uncovered the hack, said in a blog that it was likely a vulnerability in an online calendar application hosted on the web server had been exploited by the attackers.
The calendar based on the web server was an old version of software that had since been updated, he said.
""The mere presence of old software can often provide sufficient incentive for a hacker to target one system over another, and to spend more time looking for additional vulnerabilities,"" he wrote.
Once a user has entered their Apple ID and password on the fake website they are then asked to verify their name, date of birth, phone number and credit card details among other information.
Users were then directed to the legitimate Apple ID website, said Mr Mutton.
It was reported earlier in the year that other servers belonging to EA had been hacked, causing problems for users trying to log on to online games and services.
A hacking group known as Derp posted a tweet claiming responsibility for that attack.
Mr Mutton said he had reported the most recent problems to Electronic Arts.
In a statement to the BBC, EA said: ""We found it, we have isolated it, and we are making sure such attempts are no longer possible.""
Michael Sutton, from security research firm Zscaler, said that hackers using legitimate websites to host malicious content was now the norm.
""Social engineering attacks always involve an element of communication - the victim must be tricked into performing an action such as providing data, clicking on a link, downloading a file, et cetera. Attackers have learned that it's far easier to simply infect an already popular web property than to attempt communication with victims directly,"" he said.
Users should check that websites are secure before entering any private information, says guidance from Get Safe Online.
They should look for a padlock symbol in the browser window frame and they should check that the web address begins with https - the ""s"" stands for secure.
The advice also says that users should check the address in the browser's address bar after arriving at a website to check that it matches what they actually typed.",Yes
168,57,phishing,EasyJet admits data of nine million hacked,19 May 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52722626,"EasyJet has admitted that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" has affected approximately nine million customers.
It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details ""accessed"".
The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach.
EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January.
It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April.
""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC.
""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed.""
Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself.
EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks.
It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May.
It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft.
""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing.
""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays.""
In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating.
""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary.""
It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to its advice on its website on how to spot such scams.
Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis.
Google is blocking more than 100 million phishing emails every day to Gmail users.
It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.
""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said.
""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future.
""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data.""
The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially.
""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan.
""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed.
""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record. The British Airways breach in 2018 should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this.""
British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018.
Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details.
The ICO later issued a record Â£183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach Â£3bn.
Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover.
""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers.
Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant.
Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals.
The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card.
Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task.
Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions.
Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages.
Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.

169,58,phishing,Wisconsin Republicans say hackers stole $2.3m,29 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54738030,"The Wisconsin Republican party has said hackers stole $2.3m (Â£1.7m) from the its effort to support President Donald Trump's re-election.
The party contacted the FBI and agents are investigating the matter, Chairman Andrew Hitt said in a statement on Thursday.
Mr Hitt said the hackers manipulated campaign invoices to steal the funds.
In the upcoming presidential election Wisconsin is seen as a key state - one Mr Trump won narrowly in 2016.
The party's invoices for vendors were altered so that when they paid the invoices, the money did not go to the vendors, Mr Hitt said.
He noted it appeared to have begun as a phishing attempt. A party spokesman said it appeared no data was stolen.
The millions were taken from the Wisconsin Republicans' federal account.
Mr Hitt said that state officials were warned about such cyberattacks at the party's national convention in August.
Analysis by Joe Tidy, BBC cyber-security reporter
The information security world is tense right now waiting and watching for cyber attacks that could affect the US election.
This type of attack was probably not on many people's lists of expected hacks.
It sounds like an almost standard case of something called Business Email Compromise (BEC). Effectively the hackers have either gained access to or spoofed an email address to put themselves between the Wisconsin Republican party HQ and one of their suppliers. The party then transferred the money to the hackers instead of its campaign partner.
In many cases of BEC, banks are able to reverse the transaction and return at least some of the money to the victims. The Republican party will be hoping that this is what happens here.
The reported hack comes as Mr Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden are both making a final push this week to secure Wisconsin ahead of the 3 November election.
There have also been hundreds of attempted attacks on the Wisconsin Democratic campaign, a spokeswoman told the Associated Press.
The Midwestern state is one of a handful of core battleground states - areas which could realistically go to the Republicans or Democrats - this election season. Candidates will need to win in several states like Wisconsin in order to win the presidency.
How is Donald Trump doing in the polls?
Mr Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Recent polls have consistently shown a tight race, usually with Mr Biden ahead.",Yes
170,59,phishing,Technology firms create DMarc to fight phishing,30 January 2012,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16787503,"A crackdown on ""phishing"" scams has been announced by 15 of the top technology companies.
Email providers such as Google and Microsoft will work with companies like Paypal and the Bank of America to improve authentication.
Phishing attacks typically involve scammers posing as familiar companies in an attempt to trick users into sharing personal information.
This co-ordinated effort aims to make this more difficult.
TheDomain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance(DMarc) - as the coalition is known - has released plans to produce a ""feedback loop"" between email receivers and senders.
The initiative is the first significant attempt to bring together both email and service providers along with key security organisations.
DMarc said this industry-wide involvement - which covers the receivers, senders and intermediaries of email use - will mean email providers will for the first time be able to reliably filter out unwanted emails, rather than use ""complex and imperfect measurements"" to determine threats.
It will mean an agreed standard for authenticating legitimate emails arriving at the inboxes of AOL, Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo customers.
It will verify messages from Facebook, Paypal, American Greetings, Bank of America, Fidelity and LinkedIn.
""Email phishing defrauds millions of people and companies every year, resulting in a loss of consumer confidence in email and the internet as a whole,"" explained Paypal's Brett McDowell, chair of DMarc.
""Industry co-operation - combined with technology and consumer education - is crucial to fight phishing.""
Email security firms Agari, Cloudmark, eCert, Return Path and Trusted Domain Project complete the collaboration.
More companies will join the open standard as it is developed.
Paypal spokesman Rob Skinner explained how the initiative is intended to make things easier for the most vulnerable part of the security chain - the human.
""Half the problem is, with the best will in the world and improving technology, ultimately it's still down to the user to decide [to open an email],"" he told the BBC.
""The key point is trying to block emails from getting to someone's inbox - taking the worry and concern out of people's minds and doing it for them.""
As one of the internet's most ubiquitous payment companies, Paypal often finds itself impersonated by scammers.
""We've acknowledged it's been an issue,"" Mr Skinner said.
""We've had a stack of initiatives over the years to cut down on it. Fraudsters target any company that is well known, has a lot of customers, and operates across the globe.
""We recognise our responsibility to do something about it.""",Yes

Quick changeGraham Cluley, consultant at security firm Sophos, told BBC News the published list may just be a subset of a longer list of compromised accounts. ""We still don't know the scale of the problem,"" he told BBC News. Technology blog neowin.net was the first to publish details of the attack. It said the accounts were posted on 1 October to pastebin.com, a website commonly used by developers to share code. Although the details have since been removed, BBC News and Neowin has seen a list of 10,028 names beginning with the letters A and B. BBC News has confirmed that the accounts are genuine and predominantly originate in Europe. The list included details of Microsoft's Windows Live Hotmail accounts with email addresses ending hotmail.com, msn.com and live.com. Mr Cluley advised Hotmail users to change their password as soon as possible. ""I'd also recommend that people change the password on any other site where they use it,"" he said. Around 40% of people use the same password for every website they use, he added. Hotmail is currently the largest web-based e-mail service.

173,62,phishing,"Fraudsters go phishing for pop music, says producer",31 January 2012,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-16785833,"We usually hear about phishing attacks in the technology world - when impostors try to scam people out of money by tricking them into handing over their personal details.
But now it's said the technique has found its way into pop music.
Producer Richard X says he's received contact from fraudsters ""disguising"" themselves as industry workers requesting he sends them music.
""They get a little bit of information by searching databases, publishers catalogues or reading forums,"" says X, sat in his London studio.
""That's enough for them to write a cheeky email disguised as someone from the management, touring agency or someone related to the artists in an attempt to get you, the producer, to send them finished tracks or demos.""
Richard X, who has worked with Kelis, M.I.A. and the original Sugababes, puts this recent development down to the actions of tech-savvy ""rabid fans"".
""You might think that someone wouldn't fall for these emails, but in a high turnover, fast environment, which making records is now, things are needed instantly. It's possible that you would send something,"" explains X.
""I know of a producer recently who did send out the demos and the masters to a random person.""
Online leaks of music traditionally come from a range of sources - everything from the artist passing new music on to a friend to a journalist leaking a promotional copy or even a producer being careless with a storage hard drive.
This development comes as many of the collaborations which regularly fill the top 40 have been recorded without the artists ever having been in the same room.
Instead, parts of songs are recorded and exchanged online via email, digital lockers or upload sites.
Earlier this month, he tweeted a link to a pop phishing email he'd been sent.
""Not to encourage things, but it does seem like an interesting way of trying to get hold of these unreleased gems,"" he says.
""The fan-driven mentality, and rightly so, is that they want to hear new things and will do anything to get the exclusive. I personally don't think it's a big evil piracy network behind it all.""
Whatever the motives, Paul Smernicki, Head of Digital at Universal Records, says it's a broad problem his company is increasingly on the look out for.
""People through the label have been made aware to be vigilant,"" he says. ""With that particular method, the intent can only be interpreted as malicious.""
He says music leaking online from his artists (Universal - the world's biggest record label looks after everyone from Lady Gaga to Take That) is a ""relatively frequent"" occurrence.
""If someone walked up to you in the street dressed as a policeman and tried to get you to do something, that would be pretty shocking,"" says Smernicki.
""The ingenuity is surprising, but not the intent.""
He says pop phishing is among the acts of fraudsters who ""really want to damage an album campaign"" and that if music fans can get access to tracks for free, it could hurt sales.
""Some people, lots of people, may not go and buy the album,"" he says.
""People invest loads of time, energy and emotion into doing their jobs and doing them as well as they possibly can. To have the rug pulled out from under is really hard.""
He says security can be an issue and points to Jay-Z and Kanye West's Watch The Throne album as an ""extreme example"" of artists taking music protection into their own hands.
The rappers held tracks on fingerprint-protected hard drives and recorded in pop-up studios in international hotel rooms.
From it being mastered to it hitting shelves, it's not unusual for a track or an album to be sat waiting for months.
Brits Critics Choice winner Emeli SandÃ© finished her debut album last year, but it doesn't get released until 13 February.
She says she hoped it wouldn't leak, but that it feels ""almost like an inevitability now that someone will find it and it will get out"".
""It's a real shame if it affects actual sales,"" SandÃ© told Newsbeat.
""People don't understand how much work goes into making a record. How much time and how hard it is to even get it released. I feel quite upset that it happens.""
The Ting Tings' second album, Sounds From Nowheresville, has already appeared online despite not being released until March.
Multi-instrumentalist with the Salford band, Jules de Martino, takes a different view.
""Art should always have a price. I'm not a big fan of people stealing stuff, even if it's a penny,"" he explains.
""But if you're doing your stuff honestly, creatively and it's good, then I think you will stay in the game as long as you can - sales apart.
""If you're doing all right that price comes back because you're selling it in another form, whether it's tickets, T-shirts or records.""",Yes
174,63,phishing,Coronavirus: Russian spies target Covid-19 vaccine research,16 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53429506,"Russian spies are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, US and Canada, security services have warned.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the hackers ""almost certainly"" operated as ""part of Russian intelligence services"".
It did not specify which organisations had been targeted, or whether any information had been stolen.
But it said vaccine research had not been hindered by the hackers.
Russia has denied responsibility.
""We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain. We can say one thing - Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts,"" said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, according to the Tass news agency.
The warning was published by an international group of security services:
One expert said it was ""plausible"" that, despite the Kremlin's denials, Russian spies were involved.
""The received wisdom is that in cyber-space, attribution is difficult but not impossible,"" commented Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank.
""Usually the security services are much more hedgy in their language if they think there is any doubt.
""Cozy Bear [the named group] has been implicated in past cyber-attacks and has left quite a trail, and there are fairly good links to the Russian state itself.""
In recent years, Western security agencies have become more willing to call out hackers targeting companies and organisations in their countries in the hope it will deter them.
But the latest accusations are more unusual since officials are directly pointing the finger at Russian spies rather than talking generally about ""state-backed hackers"" or using other more cautious references.
And they are also challenging them over targeting something that the general public recognises as being highly sensitive - coronavirus vaccine research - rather than simply some company or government department's information.
However, on another level we should not be too surprised by the claim.
Understanding vaccine research and other details about the pandemic has become a top target for intelligence agencies around the world and many others, including Western spies, are likely to be active in this space.
The UK, US and Canadian agencies said the hackers had exploited software flaws to get access to vulnerable computer systems, and had used malware called WellMess and WellMail to upload and download files from infected machines.
They are also said to have tricked individuals into handing over login credentials with spear-phishing attacks.
But one cyber-security expert said the Russians were unlikely to be the only ones involved in such a campaign.
""They have lots of people, we have lots of people, the Americans have even more people, as do the Chinese,"" commented Prof Ross Anderson from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory.
""They are all trying to steal this kind of stuff all the time.""
The NCSC calls out a hacking group called APT29, also known as The Dukes or Cozy Bear.
It says it is more than 95% certain that the group is part of the Russian intelligence services.
Cozy Bear was first identified as being a significant ""threat actor"" in 2014, according to the American cyber-security firm Crowdstrike.
It describes the group as being ""aggressive"" in its tactics and ""nothing if not flexible, changing tool sets frequently"".
The unit has previously been implicated in hacking the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the US Presidential election in 2016.
In 2017, it attacked Norway's Labour Party, defence and foreign ministries, as well as the country's national security service.
The report includes recommendations that can help protect organisations from cyber-attacks.
""Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of Covid-19 vaccines,"" it said.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
""While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.""
On Thursday, the UK government also said Russians had ""almost certainly"" sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly-acquired documents.
""We worked very closely with our allies to ensure we would take measures to keep that information safe,"" said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, ""and we continue to do so and we are aware of those activities.""

""The National Security Agency, along with our partners, remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cyber-security advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,"" said NSA cyber-security director Anne Neuberger.
Earlier in 2020, John Demers, an assistant attorney general for US national security, warned that hackers working for foreign governments were trying to steal vaccine research.
He said that the first nation to find a vaccine first will gain clout on the world stage with a ""significant geopolitical success story"".
For that reason, hackers have been pursuing vaccine research in several countries. Demers and others who work in US intelligence have been watching their activities closely.

175,64,phishing,Phishing scam hits carbon permits,3 February 2010,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8497129.stm,"The international carbon market has been hit by a phishing attack which saw an estimated 250,000 permits worth over 3 million euros stolen this week.The scam involves six German companies and meant emissions trading registries in a number of EU countries shut down temporarily on 2 February. In the global carbon market, companies can buy permits from other firms, allowing them to emit greenhouse gases. The criminals are believed to have created fake emissions registries. They then sent e-mails to thousands of firms around the globe, including New Zealand, Norway and Australia. ""It was a world-wide action,"" Hans-Juergen Nantke, head of German emissions registry DEHSt told the Reuters news agency. Seven out of 2,000 German firms targeted are known to have fallen victim to the scam, handing over registration details which allowed the thieves to steal their emissions permits. ""Of the seven, six have been subject to theft,"" said Mr Nantke. The registry has submitted details of the attack to state prosecutors in Berlin. Illegal transactions have also been reported in the Czech Republic. Registries in nine countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Italy and Greece, closed after details of the attacks emerged. Registries in Austria, the Netherlands and Norway were temporarily suspended but reopened the same day. Emissions trading continued via the European Emissions Exchange. The United Nations' Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said it was working closely with national registries to ensure their systems were secure. The EU Commission may get involved in investigations. ""If they [transactions] happened at national level, they are traceable. If they happened internationally, our community registry will be involved as we can trace international transactions,"" a spokeswoman told Reuters. Phishing scams, which redirect people to a fake website via an e-mail, are common in the banking industry.

176,65,phishing,'Spam capital' India arrests six in phishing probe,3 January 2012,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16392960,"Police in India say they have arrested six foreign nationals suspected of defrauding hundreds of people using text message and email scams.
Scam victims were duped after being told they had won a lottery.
Authorities seized 14 laptops, seven memory sticks and 23 mobile phones, as well as fake documents and cash.
The arrests come after security firm Kaspersky reported that India now sent more spam than any other country in the world.
Police said the six men, all Nigerian, would be remanded in custody until 12 January.
The arrests signal attempts to crack down on a growing cybercrime problem in the region.
Mumbai-based internet security specialist Vijay Mukhi said poor enforcement of laws meant spammers could act with impunity.
""We have an Information Technology Act that was introduced in 2000. But we don't have any convictions under it and it's silent on spam,"" he said.
""If I'm a spammer, I would rather spam from India to India and the rest of world because nothing will happen to me.""
In its report, Kaspersky said 14.8% of all spam email sent in the three months prior to the end of September had originated in India.
Darya Gudhova, Kaspersky's spam analyst, said a lack of security awareness had given spammers free rein.
She added that there was a growing level of cybercrime activity in developing regions such as Asia and Latin America.
The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI) estimates that the country has more than 112 million internet users, the third largest in the world after the US and China.
About seven million new users are being added every month, the IMAI said.
David Emm, a security researcher from Kaspersky Labs, said this growth was making life difficult for the authorities - but believed the arrests signalled a strong sign of intent from the Indian government to get a grip on scammers.
""One of the good things is that they are taking it as a serious issue,"" he told the BBC.
""Cybercrime activity is breaking out of the western European theatre and starting to affect other parts of the globe because of the massive growth in IT.
""[In Europe] we've had cybercrime legislation for a long time with lots of expertise and history of dealing with it - but if you go to other areas like Brazil or India, you find they don't necessarily have specific cybercrime legislation.""",Yes

Police said students on government loans were sent phishing emails urging them to provide their banking details.
Damola Olatunji, 26, of Hamsterley Avenue, Manchester, and Amos Mwangi, 25, of Rochdale Way, Deptford, London, face a charge of conspiracy to defraud.
They were remanded in custody until 17 February by Westminster Magistrates' Court, central London.
Their next appearance is due to be at Southwark Crown Court in south-east London.
Mr Olatunji is also charged with possession of an article for use in fraud.
Five other people arrested in the investigation have been bailed until March pending further inquiries.
They are a 25-year-old woman arrested in Manchester, a 49-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man held in Stratford, north-east London.
Two men, aged 38 and 35, were also detained in Bolton, Greater Manchester.
They were all arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money-laundering offences and bailed until March.

It comes after more than 40 cyber scams were reported to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) between Thursday and Sunday.
The majority of the reports involved ""sextortion"".
""Sextortion"" occurs when scammers threaten to publish indecent images of their victim.
The PSNI say the criminals have been targeting people from counties Antrim, Down, Tyrone and Londonderry.
""Scammers are ruthless, unscrupulous individuals who don't care about the impact of their actions on victims, which can sometimes be life changing and which often have a significant impact,"" said Mr Walls.
""All scammers care about is getting money from their victims.â
He said most of the reports made to police involve an email which says that if the recipient does not pay Â£2,000 then indecent images of the person will be released.
Others are phishing emails in which the scammers claim to know the recipient's passwords and will share images of the person if they do not pay a fee.
There have also been reports of people being targeted over the phone.
âIt's really important that parents and guardians know what their loved ones' online activity is, who their children are engaging with and what sites they are visiting,"" added Mr Walls.
""It's also important people have a conversation with their loved ones, and with each other, so they are aware of the extraordinary lengths scammers will go to and the abhorrent tactics they will employ.""",Yes

180,69,phishing,Woolworths High Street 'relaunch' proves a hoax,27 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54706063,"A tweet announcing the relaunch of UK High Street retailer Woolworths has gone viral, despite being fake.
The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which has now been deleted, misspelled the shop's name.
And it linked to a website that was not active and had, BBC News has learned, been registered only hours earlier.
Metro, which appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news, has now corrected its story.
Very, the company that owns the local rights to the Woolworths brand, confirmed it was a hoax.
""We own the Woolworths trademark in the UK,"" a spokesman told BBC News.
""The Twitter account UKWoolworths is not connected to the Very group.""
The original tweet read: ""Here to save 2020.
""Woolworths is coming back to your High Street, as a physical store.
""A couple of legal things to get sorted but we're full steam ahead at Woolworths HQ.
""We want to get this right, so we need your help.
""What do you want at your UK #YourWoolworths?""
Ray Walsh, scam expert at virtual private network (VPN) company ProPrivacy, said: ""It's not unsurprising that huge numbers of people around the UK have fallen for fake news surrounding the reopening of Woolworths.
""The brand was a much-loved part of UK shopping history.
""And many have fond memories of the retailer.
""But the Twitter account spreading the hoax was full of typos and spelling mistakes.
""This alone should have been enough to make it obvious that something extremely fishy was going on.
""The important take away from all of this is how social engineering and nostalgia can be used to trick people.
""And it serves as an important reminder of why people need to think carefully when using the internet to avoid falling for scams and phishing attacks.""
Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing Â£385m.
The shops, famous for their Pic'n'Mix sweets, also sold kitchen and garden equipment and toys.
One of the UK's oldest chains it had 815 stores, many of which were taken over by shops such as Wilko and Poundland.
The Woolworths name remains in use in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as an unrelated retail brand.
This was the fake news story 2020 needed - and it might seem less important than harmful coronavirus conspiracy theories or political disinformation, which have spread on wildfire on social media in recent months.
But it does teach us some important lessons about how and why disinformation spreads on social media.
We tend to share posts that we want to be true or that confirm our biases - who isn't missing Woolworth's pic'n'mix, especially during a pandemic?
That partly explains why the tweet from the fake Woolworth's account - which kept spelling the name of the chain wrong - went so viral.
But it also highlights the need for verification - and the role of the media in amplifying disinformation.
A quick ring around would have confirmed that Woolworth's is not re-opening - but that did not stop a number of news outlets covering this fake Twitter account.",Yes
181,70,phishing,Dark web scammers exploit Covid-19 fear and doubt,19 May 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52577776,"""They're exploiting the fear, uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic, and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldn't have otherwise,"" says Morgan Wright, a former senior adviser to the US Department of State anti-terrorism assistance programme.
He's talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the ""dark web"" who have found a new angle - anxiety over Covid-19.
Mr Wright, who is now chief security adviser at security software company SentinelOne, used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) about the exploitation of human behaviour.
He is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as Tor.
The Tor browser is privacy-focused, meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed. It offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity, as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it.
Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor browser, to use it.
The name is an acronym for The Onion Router. Just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network.
It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department.
It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points.
Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity.
To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit node"" - rather than the person responsible.
Since the beginning of the global pandemic, marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in Covid-19 related products and services. Sought-after N95 masks, gowns, gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces. Last month, security software firm IntSights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale.
Criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products, and as a result these items are not cheap; an Australian Institute of Criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about $370 (Â£300), while one supposedly sourced from China was selling for between $10-15,000 (Â£8-12,000).
One of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web - such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles - because these industries are currently dormant.
Many criminals also see an opportunity - as the majority of people are working from home, there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place.
""There was suddenly a huge shift [on the dark web] of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home,"" says IntSights chief security officer Etay Maor.
More Technology of Business
Phishing scams have also been on the rise. These are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email, hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data, which can then be used to steal money or someone's identity.
""The phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the NHS, and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to Covid-19 like banks or HMRC emailing about funding, grants or being furloughed,"" says Javvad Malik, security advocate at training company KnowBe4.
""Now there are Covid-19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web - meaning people can imitate Apple or LinkedIn with a set of standard templates,"" he adds.
In addition, many services and products, including phishing kits are being offered at discount in ""coronavirus sales"".
""There are people who have been specialising in phishing pages, shady VPNs or spamming services for a number of years, who are now offering discounts because they believe it's the best time to make money and spread these kits,"" says Liv Rowley, threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv, a computer and network security firm.
The dark web was designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure, anonymous way.
While the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web, there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose - speaking to others anonymously on forums.
According to Mr Malik, these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus.
""Conspiracies about 5G being the vehicle of this virus, or bioweaponry or that Bill Gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web,"" he says.
As social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation, many others may be pushed onto the dark web. These forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces, for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience. This could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come.
The flipside to this is that many journalists, activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship. Tor versions of many news outlets, including the BBC and New York Times, may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states, for instance.
Netblocks, a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways, as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak.
Two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic, but as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined in a recent press briefing, there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic - including hospitals.
""These organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid,"" says Charity Wright, cyber threat intelligence adviser at IntSights.
The co-ordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web.
""We are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcare-related information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors. There's even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff,"" says Etay Maor from IntSights.
At its core, the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for - from a privacy and security perspective. But criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain.
""That's the double-edged sword that as a society we haven't quite worked out: how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy, but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms?"" says Javvad Malik.",Yes
182,71,phishing,Some Xbox Live users targeted in online phishing scam,22 November 2011,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15837971,"Xbox Live users are being urged to check their accounts after some say they were scammed by a fake email.
The phishing attack sent users to a fake site where they were asked to input personal details like addresses, emails and credit card details.
Microsoft is investigating and says a small percentage of users are affected.
""We take the security of the Xbox Live service seriously and work to improve it against evolving threats,"" a Microsoft spokesman said.
""Very occasionally, though, we are contacted by members regarding alleged unauthorized access to their accounts by outside individuals.""
The spokesman continued: ""We can confirm that only a small percentage of Xbox Live customers have been affected here in the UK.
""We work closely with impacted members directly to resolve any unauthorized changes to their accounts and, as always, highly recommend all Xbox Live users follow our account security guidance in order to protect their account details.""
Microsoft confirmed there had been no breach in the security of Xbox Live itself.
The company says there is advice on its website about staying safe online but advises that people should never give out passwords or email addresses.
It says users should never type personal information into websites unless they are sure that they are genuine.
Jason Hart, MD of Cryptocard and a former ethical hacker, said: ""Xbox customers are finding that they might have had more than Â£100 pilfered from their accounts.

183,72,phishing,Facebook works with Websense to add phishing safety net,3 October 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15154014,"Facebook have stepped up their battle against phishing and malware scammers by partnering with security firm Websense.
As of next week, users will be warned if they are about to be taken to a malicious website.
The social network has suffered to date as many of its 700 million users unwittingly click on dangerous links supposedly posted by their friends.
Such attacks usually trick users into sharing passwords or data.
Facebook already tells users if they are about to visit an external site, but the current set up makes no distinction between friendly and dangerous sites.
The new technology will present a warning screen whenever it suspects a page poses a threat to the users, giving details of the risk.
From here, users are encouraged to return to the previous page.
If they wish, users can continue to the intended page, albeit very much at their own risk.
Both Facebook and Websense will hope the extra measures will be enough to deter potential scammers from focusing their efforts on the network.
Scams regularly catch out hundreds of thousands of users at a time.
""There's over 700 million users on Facebook,"" Websense's Spencer Parker told the BBC.
""As a piece of real estate, it's extremely profitable to be targeted by malware writers.""
The protection will be powered by Websense's ""Threatseeker Cloud"", a system which stores a database of known malicious URLs.
The system can also detect unknown dangerous URLs by assessing threats in real-time.
This means harmful URLs can be blocked even before they are known to the company - cutting off a key tactic used by phishers in which constantly changing URLs fool database-driven protection.
In addition, the system will ""follow"" links made using popular URL shorteners - such as bit.ly and ow.ly - to verify their safety.
Due to the nature of how we interact with our friends, Mr Parker says phishing attacks on Facebook are much harder to prevent than other commonly used techniques.
""One of the things with Facebook, of course, is that you have that element of trust in a social network. If one of your friends posts something, you automatically trust it more than if it just received as a spam email.
""As more of these 'friend in the middle' attacks happen, you start to trust your friends less.""",Yes
184,73,phishing,Twitter hack: Bognor Regis man one of three charged,31 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53617198,"A man living in Bognor Regis - on the UK south coast - is one of three individuals charged over a major Twitter hack, according to the US Department of Justice.
Californian authorities filed felony charges against Mason Sheppard, 19.
The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) confirmed it had searched a property in Bognor Regis with police on Friday.
A teenager in Tampa and Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, were also charged in Florida.
US Attorney David L Anderson said the arrests proved ""nefarious hacking... for fun or profit"" did not pay off.
Twitter accounts of multiple high-profile US figures were hijacked in an apparent Bitcoin scam on 15 July.
They included former President Barack Obama, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, entrepreneur Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and reality star Kim Kardashian West, who all falsely tweeted out requests for Bitcoin donations.
In his statement, US Attorney Anderson said: ""There is a false belief within the criminal hacker community that attacks like the Twitter hack can be perpetrated anonymously and without consequence.""
He added: ""Criminal conduct over the Internet may feel stealthy to the people who perpetrate it, but there is nothing stealthy about it.  In particular, I want to say to would-be offenders, break the law, and we will find you.""
In Florida, Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren filed 30 felony charges against the teenager, 17, who cannot be named, for ""scamming people across America"".
The charges include organised fraud and fraudulent use of personal information.
""As a crypto-currency, Bitcoin is difficult to track and recover if stolen in a scam,"" Mr Warren said.
""These crimes were perpetrated using the names of famous people and celebrities, but they're not the primary victims here. This 'Bit-Con' was designed to steal money from regular Americans from all over the country, including here in Florida.
""This massive fraud was orchestrated right here in our backyard, and we will not stand for that.""
The charges against the teenager include 17 counts of communication fraud, 10 counts of fraudulent use of personal information, one count of fraudulent use of personal information with over $100,000 (Â£76,340) or 30 or more victims, one count of organised fraud and one count of access to computers or electronic devices without authority.
""He's a 17 year-old kid who apparently just graduated high school,"" said State Attorney Warren. ""But no make no mistake, this was not an ordinary 17-year-old. This was a highly sophisticated attack on a magnitude not seen before.""
He added that the investigation to ""discover the perpetrator"" was a collaboration between the Florida Department of Law enforcement, the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the FBI, the IRS, and the Secret Service.
The teenager lives in Tampa, Florida and so will be prosecuted by Hillsborough State authorities.
Twitter said in a statement: ""We appreciate the swift actions of law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case progresses.
""For our part, we are focused on being transparent and providing updates regularly.""
After the hack, Twitter said the hackers had targeted its employees ""with access to internal systems and tools"".
It added that ""significant steps"" had been taken to limit access to such internal systems and tools while the company's investigation continued.
According to BBC cyber-security reporter Joe Tidy, the consensus in the information security community is that Twitter's employees were likely duped by a spear-phishing attack via a phone call.
This involves using friendly persuasion and trickery to get victims to hand over crucial information that enables hackers to infiltrate a company's systems.",Yes

Dozens of people have been arrested in the US and in Egypt, accused of links to an alleged international identity theft ring targeting American banks.FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said about 100 arrests were expected across the US states of California, Nevada and North Carolina as well as in Egypt. The alleged ring is accused of using an internet ""phishing"" scheme to get data allowing it to access bank accounts. Victims may together have lost about $2m (£1.3m), Ms Eimiller said. The investigation has led to the indictment of the largest number of defendants ever charged in a cyber crime case, according to the FBI in Los Angeles. The ring used a sophisticated phishing scheme - where people are lured into revealing their details on fake websites - to obtain personal information from thousands of people and defraud American banks, the FBI statement said. Police in the US arrested 33 of 53 suspects named in Operation Phish Phry on Wednesday morning, with several more currently being sought. The authorities in Egypt have charged 47 people in connection with the scheme, the statement added. 'Significant impact'The 51-count indictment accuses all the suspects of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, charges which carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail. Some are also charged with bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit computer fraud. According to the indictment, computer hackers in Egypt used the phishing scheme to obtain bank account numbers and security details from an unknown number of bank customers. With the help of US co-conspirators, they used those details to hack into accounts at two US banks and illegally transfer funds into newly created fraudulent bank accounts, the indictment says. Some of that money was then sent to the hackers in Egypt. Acting US Attorney George Cardona said: ""This international phishing ring had a significant impact on two banks and caused huge headaches for hundreds, perhaps thousands of bank customers. ""Organised, international crime rings can only be confronted by an organised response by law enforcement across international borders, which we have seen in this case.""

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a warning saying phishing gangs were using the turmoil to extract valuable information from consumers.
A UK parliamentary group said it expected a move away from ID theft towards attacks on account holders.
The news comes as a UK banking group reveals that phishing attacks were up more than 180% in a year.
Fresh targets
The FTC said the current rapid changes in the banking world, where many institutions suddenly had new owners, could only help fraudsters keen to steal login and other personal details.
""Scammers are taking advantage of upheavals in the financial marketplace to confuse consumers into parting with valuable personal information,"" it warned.
It said it expected fraudsters to pose as the new owners of banks or the federal agencies charged with oversight of struggling institutions.
The FTC urged consumers to be wary and not reply to e-mail messages or pop-ups that ask for personal or financial information even if they appeared to come from a bank. Consumers should also scrutinise bank and credit card statements for unauthorised withdrawals or transfers.
Secure Computing said its October spam report showed that many of the banks and other financial institutions caught up in the turmoil were topping its list of phishing targets.
Chase, Wachovia and Bank of America were among the most popular targets with scammers, it said.
The company said it expected British banks to be popular too in the coming weeks as changes and mergers are completed.
In its second annual report, the All Parliamentary Group on ID Fraud said tighter credit lending rules would lead to more attempts to get at existing bank accounts.
""There is no longer a guarantee that they will get credit by applying assuming another person's identity, so they are instead tapping into accounts which already exist,"" read the report.
Fraud figures released in early October by the Association of Payment Clearing Services (Apacs), which represents UK banks, show a steep rise in the number of phishing attacks even before the turmoil in the banking world began.
From January to June 2008 phishing attacks rose by 186% on the same period in 2007, it said. In total it saw more than 20,682 phishing incidents during that six month period.",Yes
189,78,phishing,Q&A: Phishing for your precious data,7 October 2009,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8294544.stm,"""Phishing"" - an increasingly diverse and sophisticated suite of methods to trick people into parting with their precious personal data - is at a two-year high.
Here the BBC takes a look at the phenomenon and how to protect yourself.
What is phishing?
Phishing is a broad term for any effort to gain personal data, directly from the user - login details, passwords, bank account details, etc. - by tricking them into entering it into a website or email.
It is a form of ""social engineering"", where the real power lies in the manipulation of behaviour, rather than technological prowess. As such, careful consumers can often avoid falling into the phishing trap.
How does it work?
Most often, a phishing attempt will direct a user to a ""spoof"" website, designed to look like a user's legitimate banking site, payment service, or social network site.
This may be by sending an email purporting to be from a legitimate site, linking to a spoof site.
Although they are not strictly a phishing measure, past attacks may have relied on key-logging computer code, which simply stores each and every keystroke on your keyboard.
Such software can be hidden within an e-mail attachment, be downloaded from a ""spoof"" website, or masquerade as another kind of program.
An old standby for malware in general being brought into the phishing tackle box is pop-up advertising that offers updated system performance or anti-virus software. Instead, users may be installing a key-logger that reports back with any passwords or details entered thereafter.
What is the scale of the problem?
While credit card fraud this year is decreasing nearly across the board, online banking fraud is conspicuously on the rise, up 55% on the same time last year, according to industry body Financial Fraud Action UK. Phishing is likely to contribute greatly to this rise.
According to security firm MarkMonitor, the level of phishing so far this year has matched a peak that came about in 2007 as a result of the use of networks of infected computers to carry out phishing expeditions.
MarkMonitor's report suggests that the traditional phishermen's targets for high-value information - banking websites - have taken a backseat to payment websites such as PayPal. Since such payment websites work by linking a user to his or her bank account, they can act as a proxy to gain the same information.
Payment sites account for about half of all phishing attempts, while traditional banking websites have slipped to about a third.
Social networking sites are also seen as a breeding ground on the rise for phishing; attacks against social network brands are at an all-time high, with three times as many occurrences than the previous peak at about the same time last year.
How do I avoid being phished?
First and foremost, having up-to-date anti-virus and anti-spyware programs is the best first line of defence. Some security software suites such as that from AVG provide a constantly updated list of unsafe websites, warning before you even visit them.
Also, always remember that your bank and most reputable third-party payment services will never ask you for your password; were they legitimate, they would already have that information.
More difficult are the phishing attempts that direct users to spoof sites that can be difficult to distinguish from the real thing.
As always, be wary of the source of emails and the web destinations they may attempt to send you to. While the name tagged to an email sender might suggest ""NatWest Bank"", a nonsensical email address or one clearly outside the country should raise suspicion.
Attachments to e-mails remain a particularly easy place to store malicious code of all sorts, so be sure of an attachment's provenance before you open or save it.
Though it is relatively easy to mock up a website, it is much more difficult to mask exactly where that website sits in cyberspace.
For users, it is always worth checking the URL of the site where they are being directed; in most browsers, it suffices to hover over a link and look in the browser's lower-left hand corner.
Just like the source of a potentially phishy email, the URL that you are being sent to may be easily spotted as a fake. One typical approach is to transpose a couple of letters within a URL, so that a quick glance wouldn't pick it up: www.bankingwesbite.co.uk.
It's worth knowing what your trusted sites' URLs look like and keep an eye out for any changes to the site as you conduct your business.
And be careful with any site asking you to install a program, no matter how beneficial it may seem - if it seems too good to be free, there might be something phishy about it.

190,79,phishing,Which? highlights phishing losses,28 February 2007,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6401079.stm,"Banks generally refund such losses, but Which? warns that people are not guaranteed to have their money repaid.

The consumer organisation says compulsory protection should be made part of the industry's Banking Code.

Phishing frauds against UK banks have shot up from 40 to 1,000 a month in the past two years, say banking experts.


The Banking Code is a voluntary arrangement that sets out how banks should treat their customers.

It is being reviewed in the next few months and Which? believes that compensation for losses due to online fraud should be included.

""We want people to have the same protection as they do elsewhere,"" said Mike Naylor of Which?

Phishing

Phishing frauds typically involve customers being fooled by fake emails, claiming to be from a bank, which lure the customers into revealing their bank or credit card details.

Which? warns that some banks may start to take a harder line against customers who fall foul of these frauds.

A spokeswoman for the banking organisation Apacs said while this was true, there were no plans to change policies soon.

""The banks have all said they may do so in the future, because it (giving away confidential details) is like giving away your door keys,"" she said.

""But at the moment there are no current plans.""

She explained that banks were not planning to punish innocent victims of online fraud, but in some cases might refuse to compensate someone who had suffered losses more than once, on the grounds that their negligence was a contributory factor.

Emails

A standard piece of advice from banks is to claim they will never send emails to their customers asking for, or quoting, any confidential information about the customer.

But Mr Naylor said that in fact some banks do just that.

""They are sending out a mixed message,"" he said.

""They are contributing to the problem by sending out authentic emails.""

The banking industry estimates that £22m was lost to phishing frauds in the first half of 2006.

191,80,phishing,Bank phishing attacks on the rise,24 July 2008,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7523253.stm,"The number of attempts made by internet fraudsters to con people into revealing their bank account details has jumped, according to banking body Apacs.
In the first six months of this year there were 21,000 cases of ""phishing"" frauds involving banks and building societies, the body said.
That was a rise of more than 180% on the same period last year.
However, Apacs said people had become more wary of attempted fraud and so actual losses this year may fall.
Caution needed
Phishing frauds involve fraudsters sending out bogus e-mails to people, claiming to come from their banks, and inviting them to click on a link to a fake bank website.
The aim is to lure the bank customers into revealing their pin numbers and other bank account details.









We strongly urge banking customers to make sure they remain wary of online scams
 


Sandra Quinn, Apacs





Other organisations, such as HM Revenue & Customs, are also impersonated in this manner with the same aim.
Apacs said reported phishing attacks went up in 2007 to nearly 26,000 from 14,000 the year before.
However, reported losses to online banking fraud fell last year by 33% to £34m.
""In the future we expect more and more people to use online banking to make payments rather than just checking balances, particularly in light of the recent introduction of the new faster payments service,"" said Sandra Quinn of Apacs.
""However, we strongly urge banking customers to make sure they remain wary of online scams such as unsolicited e-mails claiming to be from their bank.""
More security
Internet banking has become very popular in the past few years, and Apacs says more than 21 million people are now using some sort of online banking service.
It expects that number to grow as online payments become much faster than before as a result of new systems introduced by the banking industry this year.
On the face of it this should increase the chances of success for phishing fraudsters.
But since last year banks such as Barclays and the RBS/NatWest group have been sending new gadgets to their online customers to make their internet banking more secure.
The gadgets read debit cards and generate a unique pin code which must be typed into the customer's computer each time they access their online banking system.",Yes
192,81,phishing,Phishing attacks soar in the UK,15 April 2008,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7348737.stm,"Cases of fraudsters trying to steal people's bank details more than tripled in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2007.

UK payments association Apacs said there were 10,235 so-called phishing attacks in the first quarter of the year, up from 3,394.

Con-artists send unsolicited emails asking the recipient to enter their bank details and security codes. 

They then use the data to empty online accounts of funds.


Simple advice

Sandra Quinn, director of communications at Apacs, said: ""Phishing scams are continuing to rise and they are becoming ever more sophisticated.











""Just remember that your bank will never send you emails asking you to disclose pin numbers, login details or complete passwords."" 

""If you receive an email of this nature you should delete it.""

Fraudsters have become proficient in mimicking bank and building society websites, but consumers have also become more aware of the scam.

The proportion of people ignoring such emails rose from 75% in 2006 to 82% last year, and online banking fraud losses were down from £33.5m to £22.6m in the same period.

Each incident involves fraudsters sending thousands of identical emails to computer users trying to make them believe it is a genuine request.

'No surprise'

David Cresswell, director of communications at the Financial Ombudsman Service, said: ""We've seen a significant spike in consumer concerns over phishing scams in recent months.""

Consumers and businesses are being urged to ensure that they have anti-spyware software installed on their computers to try to filter out some of the emails.

""The sharp rise in the number of phishing scams comes as little surprise,"" said Gareth Elliott, policy adviser at the British Chamber of Commerce.

""Our recent research into business e-crime showed that 31% of the businesses surveyed had fallen victim to phishing in the last 12 months alone. 

""Smaller businesses are particularly at risk as they find it harder to protect their electronic information due to limited resources.""

He called for a national e-crime fighting body to be created.

Banks have been created devices such as security key fobs and card readers as well as password checks to try to prevent data theft.

193,82,phishing,Research reveals phishing hooks,5 April 2006,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4879468.stm,"The academic study looked at whether web users could tell legitimate online bank websites from the fakes produced by phishers.

Though many phishing sites were easy to spot, the best were judged real by almost all participants.

It found that users ignored most of the visual cues on browsers that warn people that they are being scammed.


Dangerous game

Those running the study said website designers needed to re-think ways of flagging dangers to users.

The study looked at bogus websites created by phishing gangs and what made users believe that these sites were legitimate. Industry statistics suggest that, on average, 5% of those that get phishing e-mails visit an associated website and are conned into handing over data.

Although low, this figure is far more than the phishing gangs need to turn a healthy profit.

The study, carried out by Rachna Dhamija, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University, Professor Doug Tygar in the department of Computer Science at Berkeley and Professor Marti Hearst at Berkeley, suggests that on relatively sophisticated scams, many times more people are taken in.







                            SPOTTING PHISHING SITES
                        
Check the address bar - fake sites are often hosted on domains that have nothing to do with their target. Although eBay owns www.ebay.com it may not own www.ebay-members-security.com.
Retype web links rather than click on them - legitimate-looking links in phishing e-mails often redirect you to fake sites.
Spelling test - some phishing gangs make their own webpages and often they are full of spelling and grammatical errors.
Site security - most online banks use weblinks starting ""https"" rather than ""http"". 
Naked numbers - Few organisations use raw net addresses in e-mails and seeing one can flag a problem.
Use an anti-phishing toolbar - add-ons to browsers are produced by firms such as ebay, Netcraft, Geotrust, Cloudmark, Comodo and Phishing.net that can flag fake sites. Also worth using is the Site Advisor add-on for IE and Firefox.





    



The study presented real online banking and fake phishing sites to subjects to see if they could tell the two types apart.

On average, 40% of users failed to spot the phishing sites. The most sophisticated site caught out 90% of the 22 people participating.

The study revealed that people were caught out because they were generally ignorant about what did, and did not, indicate that a site was legitimate.

For instance, few of those participating looked at the domain name, such as bbc.co.uk, being displayed in a browser address bar. 

Users generally did not look at the address bar, status bar or other security indicators that could flag if they had unwittingly strayed on to a phishing site.

The problem, said the researchers, was that ""the indicators of trust presented by the browser are trivial to spoof"".

Many participants also ignored more direct warnings contained in pop-up windows that a site may not be legitimate.

The researchers also said phishing gangs were being successful because many of the scams being mounted were very sophisticated and could catch out even seasoned users.

The academics said the results would help educate users about relevant dangers and to help those who create websites know which attacks succeed and why.

The researchers said: ""These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.""

The trio of researchers said the traditional security approach looks at what can be made secure rather than work out what humans do well and exploit that to make sites safer. The team is now working on ways to make fake sites far more obvious when reached by users likely to be caught out.

194,83,phishing,European phishing gangs targeted,20 March 2006,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4825072.stm,"By the end of March, 53 cases will have begun said Microsoft, with all 100 filed by the end of June. 

Seven of the criminal groups behind fake websites that trick people into handing over confidential information are known to be in the UK.

The legal cases follow investigative work undertaken by Microsoft, national police forces and Interpol.


Caught case

""This is specific action against people that we have identified as being behind phishing sites,"" said Jerry Fishenden, national technology officer for Microsoft UK.

Phishing e-mails try to make you enter personal and login details on fake webpages made to resemble real bank sites.

Mr Fishenden said phishing had grown enormously over the last couple of years. By the end of 2005 there were known to be more than 7,000 unique phishing sites on the net.

But, said Mr Fishenden, this did not mean that there were 7,000 separate gangs at work. Many of the sites were repeat performances by established groups.

Many of those sending out the phishing e-mails were organised crime gangs who ran a scam for a few days off a net domain and then quickly moved on before the site was shut down or investigators caught up.

The phishing gangs make their money in different ways, said Mr Fishenden. Some use the login information to steal money directly from accounts, others sell the data on to those that can use it and some conmen get money for every compromised computer they seed with ad-serving software.

The numbers of phishing sites in operation was being swelled by the appearance of ""kits"" that show people how to set themselves up as computer conmen.

A couple of years ago, said Mr Fishenden, phishing e-mails were easy to spot because they were littered with spelling errors and the fake sites did not look authentic.

Now, he said, unless users knew what to look for in e-mail messages or used add-on tools for their browser to flag up the fake pages, it was easy to get caught out.

Ryan Hernandez, known online as Ryan West and RyanRocks, stole and leaked information about the Nintendo Switch before it was released.
When FBI agents seized his devices in 2019, they also found he had downloaded child sexual abuse images and videos.
He pleaded guilty to the charges and will be sentenced in April.
In 2016, Hernandez and an associate had used a ""phishing"" attack to trick a Nintendo employee into handing over their login details, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said.
He used these to download confidential files and information about the Nintendo Switch, which he leaked to the public.
In 2017, when Hernandez was still under 18, the FBI visited him at his parents' home, in California.
He told the officers he would stop hacking and understood the consequences if he continued.
But he had resumed his activity in 2018, the DOJ said.
He hacked into a Nintendo server and stole developer tools and information about unreleased games, boasting on social media about his finds.
When the FBI returned to his home, in June 2019, they found devices designed to access stolen video games as well as thousands of stolen Nintendo files.
They also found more than a thousand images and videos of child sexual abuse in a folder he named ""bad stuff"".
Under the terms of his plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend Hernandez spends three years in prison.
However, the sentence will be decided by a judge and he could be given a 20-year term for possession of the child abuse images.

Kent Commercial Services (KCS) delivers services and supplies to public authorities, including protective equipment during the Covid-19 crisis.
No ransom was paid and no personal data relating to taxpayers was stolen, KCS said.
The Information Commissioner said KCS had been given data protection advice.
KCS chief executive John Burr said: ""The timing of this attack is particularly malicious and challenging given the current Covid-19 pandemic.""
The Local Democracy Reporting Service was told the attack bore ""the hallmarks of starting with a phishing email that was used to introduce a virus that then compromised the network"".
The hackers encrypted the firm's systems and data and demanded payment to release and repair them on 2 April.
Stolen data that went on the dark web contained business and corporate information relating to business activities of KCS, based in Aylesford.
It took the company over four weeks to get the majority of systems back online with additional security, with remaining systems going live in the next two weeks.

A spokesman said it was the first time the organisation had been the target of such a phishing exercise.

""We are very worried,"" he said. ""This is a very well thought out and constructed scam,"" he said.

HMRC first became aware of the fraudulent emails earlier this week, but said it had no idea yet if anyone had been fooled or lost any money.

""We have had people calling our contact centres asking if this was legitimate or not,"" said the spokesman.

Emails

The emails claim that the HMRC has conducted a review of the person's tax affairs and has found that they are due a rebate of £70.






Invitation to submit personal details on the bogus HMRC web site





They are invited to click on a link in the email which then takes them to a bogus web site, mocked up to look like the front page of the HMRC's own main site.

There, they are told to fill in a form which asks for a social security number, tax reference code, name and address, telephone number.

Crucially, though, it also  asks for details of the person's debit or credit card to which the bogus rebate can be credited.

A further click would mean those details would be sent off directly to the fraudsters.

The call had come from what looked like a genuine TSB number, but it was a spoof and the caller was a fraudster.
Impersonation scams such as this nearly doubled to 15,000 cases in the first half of the year, according to new figures from banking trade body UK Finance.
The criminal persuaded Mr Bale that funds needed to be transferred to a ""safe account"", so he allowed payments totalling nearly Â£6,000 to be made.
""I felt humiliated and very foolish, but they were very convincing. Everyone is gullible when you are caught on the hop,"" the 76-year-old said.
""I felt myself in a spider's web, only slowly did I become aware there was something odd.""
When the con-artist demanded more information Mr Bale become more suspicious, ending the call and contacting the bank.
The money was refunded under a TSB pledge to cover all fraud losses suffered by innocent victims.
Thousands of other victims of fraud have not been so lucky.
Most of the biggest players in the UK banking sector are signed up to an agreement to ensure victims of so-called authorised push payment fraud are refunded when they or their bank are not to blame.
However, with Â£126m of losses considered under the new code in the first half of the year, only Â£48m (38%) was refunded, new data from UK Finance shows.
Banks consider cases individually, and point out that some people are not refunded as they have ignored scam warnings.
However, concerns have been raised over the inconsistency of the code between different banks.
Regulators have warned that the ""right outcomes"" had not always resulted in these cases, and UK Finance now wants the code to become law.
Overall, Â£208m was lost to authorised push payment fraud in the first half of the year, when victims were persuaded to make transfers to people they believe are genuine traders or service providers.
A total of Â£374m was lost to criminals through other, unauthorised fraud, such as when banking security systems are circumvented.
UK Finance has warned that criminals are using the coronavirus crisis to trick people - often as they use online or mobile banking for the first time - into giving their personal and financial details.
As a result, it expects fraud levels to rise in the latter half of the year and early next year.
""Criminals have ruthlessly adapted to this pandemic with scams exploiting the rise in people working from home and spending time online,"" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance.

NatWest, Halifax and Barclays have introduced the security measure in response to a massive rise in the number of ""phishing"" attacks.

Phishing is a scam where criminals send fake bank e-mails to trick customers into revealing their account details.

This fraud cost the banks £12 million last year, and is getting worse.

Sandra Quinn of Apacs told BBC Radio 4's Money Box that April saw the second highest number of attacks ever, and added: 

""What we saw when it started in September 2003 was only about three attacks that month. That is three separate banks being targeted with a set of e-mails going out to customers.""

""In April we saw 54 separate attacks happening in the UK. It is a massive increase in the last 18 months.""

Although the number of victims is still low, it is the sharp rise in the number of attacks that has forced the banks to take action. 
Unusual payments

Until now customers could make instant online money transfers from their accounts to other people's accounts in the same banking group.  






The delays will not affect every payment that is made





But the fraudsters exploited this and made it their favourite method of stealing money.  

Because of this there will now be a delay for some electronic transfers, of several hours or up to a day.    

John Warren of Barclays said the delay would not affect all payments:
""We are not affecting payments that have been made before and are set up on their system.  We are not affecting payments to credit card companies or utility bills that are set up as well.










It just allows our systems and procedures to check and validate their payments

""We are introducing a day's delay to payments made by Barclay's customers to other Barclays bank holders which are made for the first time. 



""It just allows our systems and procedures to check and validate their payments... and spot payments that are unusual,"" he said.


If a transaction does look suspicious the bank will contact the sending account holder before allowing the payment to go through.  


Clearing times


However, there are concerns this move could hold up the introduction of faster electronic payments which many people have been calling for. 

There has been particular pressure on banks to reduce the three working days it takes for electronic transfers from accounts between different banking groups.

""They could do more on security if they need to.  But they cannot use this as an excuse to sit on people's money for days on end.

200,89,phishing,Cyber threat to disrupt start of university term,17 September 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54182398,"Universities and colleges are being warned by the UK's cyber-security agency that rising numbers of cyber-attacks are threatening to disrupt the start of term.
The National Cyber Security Centre has issued an alert after a recent spike in attacks on educational institutions.
These have been ""ransomware"" incidents which block access to computer systems.
Paul Chichester, the NCSC's director of operations, says such attacks are ""reprehensible"".
The return to school, college and university, already facing problems with Covid-19, now faces an increased risk from cyber-attacks, which the security agency says could ""de-rail their preparations for the new term"".
The cyber-security body, part of the GCHQ intelligence agency, says attacks can have a ""devastating impact"" and take weeks or months to put right.
Newcastle University and Northumbria have both been targeted by cyber-attacks this month, and a group of further education colleges in Yorkshire and a higher education college in Lancashire faced attacks last month.
The warning from the NCSC follows a spate of ransomware attacks against academic institutions - in which malicious software or ""malware"" is used to lock out users from their own computer systems, paralysing online services, websites and phone networks.
The security agency says this is often followed by a ransom note demanding payment for the recovery of this frozen or stolen data - sometimes with the added threat of publicly releasing sensitive information.
Universities have frequently been targets of cyber-attacks - with up to a thousand attacks per year in the UK.
Attacks can be attempts to obtain valuable research information that is commercially and politically sensitive. Universities also hold much personal data about students, staff and, in some cases, former students who might have made donations.
Earlier this summer more than 20 universities and charities in the UK, US and Canada were caught up in a ransomware cyber-attack involving a cloud computing supplier, Blackbaud.
A Freedom of Information inquiry in July, carried out by the TopLine Comms digital public relations company, found 35 UK universities, out of 105 responses, had faced ransomware attacks over the past decade. There were 25 which had not had attacks - and a further 43 which declined to answer.
One university reported 42 separate ransomware attacks since 2013.
The warning from the NCSC highlights the vulnerability of online systems for remote working, as increased numbers of staff are working from home.
""Phishing"" attacks, where people are tricked into clicking on a malicious link such as in an email, also remains a common pathway for such ransomware attempts, says the advice.
Mr Chichester of the NCSC says: ""The criminal targeting of the education sector, particularly at such a challenging time, is utterly reprehensible.""
""I would strongly urge all academic institutions to take heed of our alert.""
Universities UK says data security has had to become a priority for higher education - and that ""protections are in place to manage threats as much as possible"".
The universities body also says it is working with the NCSC to produce ""robust guidance on cyber-security"" which will be released later this academic year.",Yes

Europol said it had information that âstrongly indicates increased online activity by those seeking child abuse materialâ.
With schools closed and many working from home, children are more likely to be using the internet unsupervised.
The agency also said cyber-criminals are taking advantage of the crisis.
In online forums and boards, child abusers are âwelcoming opportunities to engage with childrenâ, Europol said.
It warned that abusers expect children âto be more vulnerable due to isolation, less supervision and greater online exposureâ.
A spokeswoman said the agency could not share which national law enforcement agencies had raised concerns, but described the increase in activity as a âworrying trendâ.
Supervision needed
âThere are lots of kids at home, off school, and theyâre online while their parents are busy working,â said Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert at the University of Surrey.
âUnderstand the risk - itâs the very time that these people take advantage of your attention being somewhere else.â
The NSPCC said technology companies also had a âvital jobâ to do in protecting children from abusers on their platforms - and report suspicious activity to police.
âWorryingly, abusers will see this national health emergency as an opportunity to target children who are spending more time online and may be feeling increasingly lonely or anxious because of the lockdown,â said Andy Burrows, NSPCC Head of Child Safety Online.
âAt home it is now more important than ever for parents and carers to be having regular conversations with their children about what theyâre doing online, and that they know they can come to you with any worries they may have.â
The NSPCCâs Net Aware website contains information for parents about different social networks and websites, and how to stay safe online. It has recently added articles about video chat and livestreaming services, and the newly-popular Netflix Party extension.
Europolâs report also warned of the high level of other cyber-crime, including phishing emails that pretend to contain information about the virus in links and attachments which ""aim to profit from the global health concern.â
Many of the scams being employed are classic cyber-attacks, with a new coronavirus angle in the way they are presented.
âThe psychology theyâre using is the same, but some of the classic human responses are heightened at the moment,â Prof Woodward said.

202,91,phishing,Lancaster University students' data stolen by cyber-thieves,23 July 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-49081056,"The personal data of students and applicants has been stolen in a ""sophisticated and malicious"" phishing attack at Lancaster University.
Officials said the information had been used to send bogus invoices to undergraduate applicants.
""A very small number"" of student records, phone numbers and ID documents were also accessed, it said.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the university had suffered a ""compromise of its systems"".
In a statement, the university said it became aware of a breach on Friday and has been working to secure its systems.
It said the data included names, addresses, phone numbers and emails, linked to students who had applied to join the university in 2019 and 2020.
""We are aware that fraudulent invoices are being sent to some undergraduate applicants,"" it said.
""At the present time, we know of a very small number of students who have had their record and ID documents accessed.""
It said the affected students would be contacted with advice.
Phishing involves attempts to trick web users into handing over sensitive information.
An NCA spokesman said: ""A criminal investigation led by the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit is now under way, and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.""
A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it had received a report from the university and would assess the information provided.
Lawyer Helen Davenport, who advises clients on cyber security, said it was ""essential"" sectors such as higher education took cyber-security risks ""seriously"" and put training and software in place to ""proactively shield against future attacks"".
She said ""all eyes"" would now be on how the attack had impacted students' data and how the university intended ""to guard against something likely to be attempted again"".
Failure to do so ""could affect the attractiveness of the university to future candidates"", she added.

204,93,phishing,Criminals prey on coronavirus fears to steal Â£2m,16 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52310804,"About Â£2m has been lost to coronavirus-related fraud in the UK as criminals look to cash in on the crisis.
At least 824 people have fallen victim to Covid-19 scams this year, according to latest figures from Action Fraud.
Experts say criminals are playing on virus fears and posing as official sources to obtain details from people seeking compensation.
A fraud expert told the BBC criminals were trading ""templates"" on how to defraud people on the dark web.
And analysis shows more than 70,000 ""malicious"" websites have also sprung up since the global pandemic was declared.
Guidance issued by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has detected ""more UK government branded scams relating to COVID-19 than any other subject,"" since the start of March.
There are now 2,500 they are aware of, ranging from fake offers of tax rebates to bogus medicines.
The organisation says criminals are primarily targeting people with Covid-19 related ""phishing"" emails.
These attempt to make individuals hand over personal or even bank details, usually by clicking on a link first.
One particular scam asks Android users to download a ""coronavirus tracker app"" to see cases in their area.
In fact, it installs ransomware - a type of software aimed at stealing information - on the user's phone.
Emails may ""spoof"" organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or an individual with ""Dr"" in their title, the NCSC says.
A known scam purports to be sent on behalf of the government and is offering payments to people ""as part of its promise to battle Covid-19"".
The National Crime Agency (NCA) says fraudsters are ""adapting their behaviour under lockdown.""
As a response it says it is ""redoubling"" its efforts to bring them to justice and is deploying more officers online.
So far, the NCA has taken down six web domains known to be exploiting the virus.
However, one expert believes criminals are also exploiting the fact that people are at home by calling landlines.
Founder of the Fraud Alert website and former Metropolitan Police detective, Colin Holder, is one of many security experts who monitor dark web criminal forums for signs of new scamming methods.
Often criminals will share ""templates"" or guides showing how to crack passwords and defraud people.
He said they would now look to cash in on landline numbers they may have purchased in recent years.
""They are trading a vast amount of mobile numbers every day, but a lot of people now don't answer mobile numbers they don't recognise,"" Mr Holder said.
""If you are at home, you are very likely to answer your landline - so we have seen home numbers being traded quite consistently. This is the time they will look to use them.
""Criminals never want to spend money, but where else can you get someone else's home phone number from now?""
Mr Holder said criminals will often start the call with the home occupant's name to ""lull"" them into a conversation.
""Then if they have some data from an official source it makes them sound legitimate,"" he added.
Mr Holder said criminals may not even ask for a bank account - they may be looking for a piece of information that could lead to a password or the answer to a commonly used security question such as ""mother's maiden name"".
Editor of the proprivacy.com website Sean McGrath has compiled a list of newly registered websites linked to phishing scams or considered ""malicious"" by security companies since the outbreak.
In January, there were 1,772 new URLs registered worldwide. In March that jumped to 62,771.
They include website titles such as ""childcarecorona.com"" and ""heatingincorona.com"".
Many appear to look legitimate and feature the same wording and branding as the World Health Organisation.
""At the very least the websites are spreading misinformation,"" said Mr McGrath. ""They are part of campaigns that want to spread a message that is disingenuous.
""At the other end these are sites that, by getting you to download something, are installing malware or ransomware on your computer.
""The criminality is spreading at the same rate as the virus itself.""
Mr McGrath said the websites work by preying on a need for information in a time of crisis. Most are sent out as a link in a phishing email.
Action Fraud has urged people to watch out for scam emails that appear to be from official sources and to research sites before buying goods online.

He admitted three counts of fraud and perverting the course of justice at Preston Crown Court on Tuesday. 

It is thought to be the first UK conviction for the practice, which is known as phishing fraud.


More than 160 people were duped in the scam in 12 months between July 2003 and July 2004.






eBay warns buyers against using money transfers for transactions




The gang was masterminded by Levi, who enlisted his younger brother Guy, 22, and IT expert Daniel Lett, also 22, to help in the scam. 

Four other men allowed them to use their bank accounts so they could hide the money.

The court was told they set up a network of computers which sent out e-mails to eBay customers asking for their details. 

People who replied thought they were taken to a secure eBay site when they were in fact connected to the criminals' own computers.

Using these stolen eBay credentials the gang would then access the accounts of vendors with a reliable, recommended sales history and assume their eBay identity.

The gang would then offer expensive items up for sale, such as laptop computers and designer watches, before disappearing with the cash. 

'Callous disregard'

Guy Levi, of Porland Court, St Annes, Lancashire, was jailed for 21 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud.

Daniel Lett, of St Annes Road, Lytham, Lancashire, was given a two-year jail term after admitting charges of conspiracy to defraud.

Derek Anderson, 59, of Pilling Avenue, St Annes; Chris Worden, 23, of Shore Street, Blackpool; Craig Jameson, 31, of Councillor Lane, Cheadle, Greater Manchester; and Gareth Rice, 22, of Derbe Road, St Annes, were each jailed for six months on money laundering charges.

206,95,phishing,Coronavirus: UK forces hundreds of scam Covid-19 shops offline,21 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52361618,"The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it took down more than 2,000 online coronavirus scams last month.
NCSC said this included 471 fake online shops that were selling fraudulent virus-related items.
It coincides with new online safety advice from the agency as part of a national awareness campaign.
NCSC also launched an email reporting service, which the public can use to flag any suspicious activity.
Numerous other malware and phishing sites have been removed, as well as almost 900 advance-fee fraud schemes, where a large sum of money is promised in return for a one-off payment.
There is growing concern that criminals are hoping to capitalise on the increased usage of the internet during the pandemic.
âCriminals are seeking to exploit our greater use of emails, video conferencing and other technologies for their advantage,"" said Minister for Security James Brokenshire.
âItâs despicable that they are using the coronavirus outbreak as cover to try to scam and steal.""
The public is being advised to forward suspicious emails to report@phishing.gov.uk. An automated program will test websites flagged as a result, and block those determined to be suspicious.
Joe Tidy, cyber-security reporter
These scams nearly always start with an email.
The NCSCâs Suspicious Email Reporting Service provides a way to report dodgy messages. The problem is that recipients often do not recognise them as such.
Iâve been tracking coronavirus phishing emails since the start of the outbreak.
Some are laughable: ""Please send $250 worth of iTunes gift cards for essential lockdown supplies!""
But there are many others that are well designed and hard to spot.
Fake emails are in circulation that appear to be from the World Health Organisation (WHO). They are cleanly written, have all the correct logos and signatures, and even look like they have been sent from a WHO email address.
Itâs all fake though, and victims who download the accompanying ""advice document"" may give control of their finances to hackers.
The NCSC says the public needs to be highly suspicious. Donât download or click on anything unless you are absolutely certain of the sender, and if the offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Commander Karen Baxter, national lead for fraud with the City of London Police, said the service was developed to help ""empower the public"" during a time of crisis.
âLaw enforcement is working closely with the government to ensure the public, and businesses, are as well equipped as possible to fight online harms,"" she said.
âOfficers have already executed a number of warrants across the country to target and disrupt criminals sending emails and texts designed to steal your money.â
Social media giants vowed last month to combat the spread of misinformation related to Covid-19.
With demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) soaring, an investigation by the news site Wired reported that scammers were using LinkedIn to sell fake goods after being blocked by eBay and Amazon.
âPeople do use LinkedIn to find customers, close deals, and build relationships,"" the Microsoft-owned social network told the publication.
""However, it is absolutely not acceptable, especially now, for someone to use their LinkedIn profile or a post on the platform to inappropriately promote that they have personal protective equipment available to sell.""

Phishing is used by fraudsters and organised crime to gain bank details.

MessageLabs' information security analyst Natasha Staley said the figures were ""just the tip of the iceberg"".

'Tip of the iceberg'

The Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) told BBC News Online last month it was worried by a surge in phishing scam e-mails over a period of days.

Phishing ""scamsters"" pose as a bank to request personal details as part of a bogus ""security check"". 

If the customer falls for the e-mail scam and enters his or her details, the scamsters can empty that account or use it to launder money.

MessageLabs' information security analyst Natasha Staley said:  ""We are only monitoring our customers' emails so this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

""The true extent of the problem is just impossible to
quantify.""









You just send out loads
of spam emails and hope that 1% of them will hit
 


Spokeswoman for the National High-Tech Crime Unit 






Its own figures hit a peak in January when it stopped 337,350 ""phishing"" e-mails. 

A spokeswoman for the National High-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) warned that the scam companies were using ever more ways to expand their illegal earnings.

The ""phishing"" gangs were now using ""mules"" recruited
through online job websites to withdraw the cash from the duped customers' accounts before it is then wired to the criminals, she said.

""What we are seeing now is that instead of money going straight from the account into the criminal's account what they are doing is 'washing' it through
these `mules',"" she said.

In the past, customers of many of the UK's major High Street banks such as Natwest, Barclays and Lloyds TSB have been targeted.
'Working together'

Banks and the NCTHU are working around the clock to close the phishing sites.

The spokeswoman for the NHTCU, which is investigating the fraud, said high street banks had been working closely together to combat the scam.

""They got together quite quickly at the beginning and I have seen the marketing material that they are sending out,"" she said.
 ""There is not a lot more they can do apart from warn customers of the danger.

""A lot of people are not falling for it but some people still are.

Spoof e-mails

The security update addresses three flaws in Microsoft's browser. The most serious is one which could direct a user to a fake website, even though the internet link looked real.

The flaw could be used in so-called ""phishing"" scams in which people are sent e-mails and asked to click on a link to update financial information or verify passwords.

The smartphone app is being trialled on the Isle of Wight and is expected to be rolled out nationwide.
People across Britain have received scam texts purportedly generated by the app, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) said.
The message links to a bogus website which asks for personal details.
The scam text reads: ""Someone who came in contact with you tested positive or has shown symptoms for Covid-19 & recommends you self-isolate/get tested.""
CTSI lead officer Katherine Hart said she had received a scam text herself and was aware of recipients across England, Scotland and Wales.
She said: ""This worried me because at this particular time we are all at risk.
""I am especially concerned that scams themed around the contact tracing app are already appearing, even though the official NHS app has only been released in a limited testing phase on the Isle of Wight.""
The app records people's proximity to other app users, allowing potential infection routes to be traced.
On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the app would be rolled out across England in mid-May.
It has been downloaded more than 55,000 times since it was launched on the Isle of Wight.

211,100,phishing,Users face new phishing threats,20 October 2004,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3759808.stm,"Sophisticated tricks that make fake messages look more plausible could mean many more people fall victim warns researcher Markus Jakobsson.

These new attacks could exploit online social networks or tune messages to an individual's circumstances, he said. 

To combat these new types of attack, Mr Jakobsson recommends reducing how much personal data people share.

Clever criminals
Phishing attacks have become more prevalent recently as net-savvy criminals find better ways to make their fake e-mail messages look legitimate.

Some of the most sophisticated phishing e-mail messages refer people to sites that look exactly the same as the website of whichever financial firm or online company they are targeting.

Coding tricks can hide the real locations of these fake sites and many people have unwittingly handed over key information such as login names, passwords and account numbers.

One recent attack overlaid the browsing bar on Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser with a fully functioning fake to hide the true origins of the site users were looking at. 






Phishing gangs might fake network problems 





	
But Markus Jacobsson, co-director of the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research, at Indiana University said future attacks could be even more sophisticated and, as a result, catch even more people out.

""I came up with the worst kind of attacks I could think of and then worked on how to defend against them,"" he said.

Future phishing attacks could be ""context aware"" said Mr Jakobsson and take advantage of what attackers can find out about potential victims.

An example of such an attack would involve e-mails sent to people who bid on an item in an eBay auction. The e-mail could falsely claim that a person had won the auction and ask them for personal details to complete the sale.

Another such attack could mine social networks, such as Orkut, to find out who knows whom and use the names it finds to create fake e-mails that look like they come from a victim's friends or relatives.

""A phisher can find out whether a person in your 'personal network' list is a wife, a husband, a sister or a business associate, and take advantage of that,"" he said.

A third type of attack could fake a problem with a user's net access and then send an e-mail posing as a service firm keen to fix the problem.

Mr Jakobsson suspects that such sophisticated attacks could catch out up to 50% of people. Statistics show that a maximum of 3% of people fall victim to current phishing e-mail attacks.

While technology will help combat some of these attacks, Mr Jakobsson said action needed to be taken by users too.

""Personal information should only be displayed publicly on Web sites if it is absolutely necessary, or if a user gives his or her specific assent, knowing the risks,"" he said.

""Government can help by requesting or requiring these changes,"" said Mr Jakobsson.",Yes
212,1,DoS attack,Burkina Faso ambush: Spaniards and Irishman killed after abduction,27 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56892436,"Two Spanish journalists and an Irish national abducted near a nature reserve in eastern Burkina Faso have been killed.
The Europeans were part of an anti-poaching patrol that was ambushed by gunmen near Pama Reserve on Monday.
Burkina Faso government officials confirmed their deaths on Tuesday. A local soldier was also abducted, but his status is unknown.
It remains unclear who carried out the attack.
The West African country is facing a deepening security crisis, like many of its neighbours, as Islamist armed groups carry out raids and kidnappings across much of the region.
The patrol on Monday included soldiers, forest rangers and foreign reporters.
Two soldiers wounded in the ambush told the Associated Press (AP) news agency the attack had been launched by jihadists who had outnumbered the patrol.
One of the soldiers was shot in the leg and the other in his arm, causing it to be amputated, according to AP. The soldiers said they had tried to form a protective shield around the foreigners, but realised when the shooting stopped that they had disappeared.
Vehicles and weapons were also seized in the attack.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya told reporters on Tuesday that bodies found in the area appeared to be those of two Spanish journalists who had been filming a documentary.
Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez later tweeted: ""The worst news is confirmed.""
He named the journalists as David Beriain and Roberto Fraile, and praised ""those who, like them, carry out courageous and essential journalism from conflict zones"".
Mr Beriain was a seasoned journalist who had reported from around the world and launched his own production house, while Mr Fraile had covered several conflicts as a cameraman, including the war in Syria.
On Tuesday Burkina Faso officials confirmed their deaths, as well as the death of an Irish national.
The Irish victim was named as Rory Young, co-founder and president of the anti-poaching group Chengeta Wildlife. The organisation called him an ""inspirational leader"".
In a statement, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he had learned with ""deep dismay"" of Mr Young's death, and offered condolences to the families of all three victims.
""The minister condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of those who are responsible for this attack. We will continue to liaise with the authorities and partners on the ground on the matter,"" the statement said.
A senior security source told AFP news agency that the three Europeans had been ""executed by terrorists"".
The secretary general of journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders reacted to the news on Twitter, saying ""this tragedy confirms the great dangers reporters face"" in Africa's Sahel region.
Details of what happened to the local soldier who was abducted were not immediately clear.
The kidnappings are the latest in the former French colony where wildlife reserves used to be popular with tourists.
But many of them are in territory now targeted by jihadists.

More investment and leadership was needed for such areas, he said.
But it would not be an ""easy fix"".
Admitting that he took part in rioting in his youth, the former boxer said much of the violence is ""recreational"" and ""there is not a lot to do in some of these areas for kids"".
""I was one of them kids and when there was a riot going on at the bottom of my street growing up in Tiger's Bay, you got involved in it,"" he told BBC News NI.
""Not because you were a bad kid but because you were excited by it and there literally was not much else to do.""
Dozens of police officers were injured during several nights of rioting in Londonderry, Belfast, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Ballymena during late March and early April.
The loyalist Tiger's Bay area was one of the flashpoints.
""You've got a few emotions when you see stuff like that,"" said Frampton.
""I think projects and money needs to be pumped into these kind of working class areas to help kids with educational programmes, whatever it may be, with jobs, with opportunities and this can be sorted out.
""I wouldn't say it's an easy fix but I think that a united voice from politicians, especially on this matter, and it can be repaired.""
Discussing his post-retirement plans, Frampton said he would consider setting up a foundation or engaging with community projects to help young people in working class areas.
""Places like Tiger's Bay where I'm from and Poleglass where my wife's from, and the New Lodge, Falls, Shankill, wherever - I want to give back and help kids really and give kids opportunities,"" he said.

Anti-terror prosecutors have taken over the inquiry, and the killing is being treated as a possible terrorist attack.
The attacker, who reportedly came to France from Tunisia several years ago, was shot dead by police.
President Emmanuel Macron led tributes to the 49-year-old victim, and said France would never give in to ""Islamist terrorism"".
The stabbing took place in the secure entrance to the police station in the commuter town of Rambouillet at 14:20 (12:20 GMT).
Witnesses said the attacker had been seen walking around while on his mobile phone outside the police station and seized his chance to go in as the woman - an unarmed administrative officer - went through the security doors.
He reportedly lunged at the officer, stabbing her in the neck. Her colleagues then opened fire on him.
Anti-terrorism prosecutors said they took over the investigation because of the way the attack had unfolded, remarks made by the attacker and the fact that he targeted a police official.
Sources close to the inquiry told media outlets that the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) during the attack.
Officials said the attacker, 36, was not previously known to security agencies. Local outlet BFMTV reported that he had lived in the country illegally before obtaining a residency card, which was due to expire later this year.
Three people were arrested following the attack, according to reports. A judicial source told AFP news agency they were part of the suspect's ""entourage"".
In a Twitter post following the attack, Mr Macron said the victim's name was StÃ©phanie. ""The nation is by the side of her family, her colleagues and security forces,"" he wrote.
Her full name has not been released, but local media reports describe her as a mother of two.
Prime Minister Jean Castex and Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin went straight to the scene, in the large Yvelines area to the west of the capital.
Mr Castex said the country had lost an ""everyday heroine"" and condemned what he described as a ""barbaric act of boundless cruelty"".
""Our determination to combat terrorism in all its forms is as resolute as ever,"" he told reporters.
ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, president of the Paris region, said the attack had been against a ""symbol of France"". The police, she said, were ""the face of France"".
Far-right leader Marine Le Pen - seen as the strongest challenger to Mr Macron in next year's presidential election - tweeted condemnation of Friday's attack before details of the suspect's identity had been made public.
""The same horrors come one after another, the same infinite sadness as we think about the relatives and the colleagues of this female police employee who has been killed, the same type of person guilty of this barbarity, the same Islamist motives,"" she wrote.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also reacted to the attack on Twitter.
""We stand with our French friends and allies following tragic news of a female police officer killed by a terrorist in Rambouillet while doing her job,"" he wrote.
In his comments on Friday, Mr Castex noted that the Yvelines area had been targeted before, including in 2016 when two members of the police force were fatally stabbed at their home.
In October 2020 the militant Islamist murder of teacher Samuel Paty in Yvelines led to national outrage, as he was attacked after an online campaign that began with false claims from a 13-year-old girl at his school.
Deadly attacks on French police
January 2015: Two police officers were among those killed in the attack at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A third was killed in a related attack the following day.
June 2016: A police commander and his partner, also a police official, were stabbed to death at their home west of Paris by a man claiming allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group. The attacker was killed in a police assault on the house.
April 2017: A French policeman was killed by a jihadist on the Champs ElysÃ©es in Paris. Two other officers were wounded in the attack. The suspect was shot dead by security forces, and a note defending IS was found near his body.

216,5,DoS attack,Streatham attack: What do prisons do to deradicalise inmates?,3 February 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-51357313,"A man shot dead by officers on Sunday, during what police called an Islamist-related terrorist incident, had been out of prison for about a week.
So, what is done in prisons to deradicalise people like Sudesh Amman, who stabbed people on Streatham High Street?
Amman, 20, served half of a sentence of three years and four months for terror offences.
He pleaded guilty in November 2018 to six charges of possessing documents containing information useful to terrorists - and seven of passing them on. The documents included a ""manual"" on knife fighting.
Before he was jailed, Amman had convictions for having a broken bottle as an offensive weapon and possessing cannabis.
A programme called Healthy Identities Intervention (HII) is the UK's main in-prison scheme to challenge the thinking of terrorism offenders.
After the 2019 Fishmongers' Hall attack, the creator of the 10-year-old scheme, forensic psychologist Chris Dean, told the BBC there is no certainty all terrorism offenders can be reformed.
It aims to get offenders to think carefully, often over a very long series of counselling sessions, why they chose to turn to terrorist violence. They are asked whether the violence, or support of it, defines their identity.
In some cases, an offender may turn away from violence quickly. But it is often more difficult when prisoners who have spent years in jail, or supporting banned organisations, are involved.
In the case of those aligned to jihadist organisations, prison service imams also get involved in religious counselling sessions. These have been criticised for using chaplains without the detailed knowledge of jihadist ideology required to break down extremist beliefs.
In theory, every prisoner convicted of a terrorism-related crime is eligible to attend HII sessions, or similar schemes.
Some refuse to co-operate and others may not need specialist intervention because they have found their own way to change for the better.
It is not clear whether the prison service has sufficient resources in place for all the prisoners who may want to take part.
Prof Andrew Silke, another expert in the field, said last year there were waiting lists and some offenders never get seen before their release date.
We don't know. Mr Dean told the BBC that HII had seen successes. However, there were also hard cases because of the psychological hold that other extremists, or an ideology, had over the life of an inmate.
The HII programme has not been independently evaluated. One reason is it would be unethical to carry out a scientific trial in which some offenders are released without receiving therapy, just to see if they were most likely to reoffend.
In 2015, the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove asked Ian Acheson, a former prison governor, to review how extremism was being handled. Mr Acheson concluded that the system was full of flaws.
This is the second time that a convicted terrorism offender has come out of jail and carried out an attack, leading to their death at the hands of armed police.
Usman Khan was shot dead by police after he killed two people and injured three others in December's attack at Fishmonger's Hall, London Bridge.
The police have successfully caught other suspects who continue to plot after their release - including a cell in Birmingham who were uncovered planning a marauding knife attack in the city.
Some nations separate Islamist extremist prisoners in jails, to prevent radicalisation.
The Acheson review found that in the Netherlands, Spain and France the separation of extremist offenders had worked well. It had improved prison safety and order. That, in turn, had helped the authorities to better target counter-radicalisation schemes at those who would most benefit.
The UK only recently began operating so-called ""separation units"" for the highest risk detainees. However, there have been reports of disagreement within the prison service over whether they are being properly used.
Saudi Arabia claims to have had the most success, targeting 3,300 inmates since 2005. The authorities there claim an 80% success rate - with the remaining 20% returning to violence.

Oliver Bowden, 56, died at Mill End Farm in Hambleden, Buckinghamshire on 5 May.
The father of four, who also had two grandchildren, was found in the pen by colleague Samuel Beer who called emergency services while trying to protect Mr Bowden.
An inquest jury concluded that he died through misadventure.
He died at the scene, having sustained fatal multiple injuries, including crushing to the chest and abdomen.
The jury in Beaconsfield heard the family had farmed the land since the 1930s.
Mr Beer said he found Mr Bowden after noticing a bucket and a shoe in the corner of the shed.
In a statement, he said he jumped into the pen and ""saw Oliver lying on the floor"".
""He had blood all over his face and head. I couldn't tell how bad his injuries were, but he wasn't moving.""
Mr Beer said he tried to find Mr Bowden's pulse several times while he called the emergency services.
""As I was doing this, I was attacked by a bull as I was standing over Oliver to protect him,"" he said.
""I picked up a stick to hit the bull with it to try to get it to leave me alone, as I tried to help Oliver.""
He said he did not know how long Mr Bowden had been lying in the pen, or which bulls had attacked him or the farmer.
An air ambulance crew arrived and pronounced Mr Bowden dead at about 15:50 BST.
A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) report produced at the inquest stated Mr Bowden was known to tell employees not to enter the bull pen by themselves.
HSE inspector Nick Ward, said: ""After eight months, bulls are known to be more boisterous and aggressive than castrated animals.
""At no time should it be necessary to enter a pen of bulls to carry out any work.""
The day after the death, the 17 bulls were taken to an abattoir.
Mr Bowden's family said they would no longer raise bulls for beef.
His funeral cortege was followed by a 45-tractor procession.

218,7,DoS attack,Mozambique Palma attack: Why IS involvement is exaggerated,17 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56773012,"The recent insurgent raid on the Mozambican town of Palma made global headlines because foreigners were killed and because the Islamic State group said it was behind it, leading to sharp divisions as to how Mozambique's four-year-old conflict should be interpreted, writes analyst Dr Joseph Hanlon.
Palma had always been a sleepy fishing town, until last year it was transformed into a thriving hub for Mozambique's burgeoning gas industry.
The French company Total began to develop a $20bn (Â£14.6bn) gas liquification plant for the second largest gas reserve in Africa.
Total was developing its own walled compound with airstrip and pier on the Afungi Peninsula 10km (6 miles) south of Palma. But the contractors and service industry were all based in Palma, which saw a building boom of hotels, banks and construction yards.
When the insurgents entered on 24 March they were attacking a rapidly growing town with significant foreign investment and more than 1,000 foreign workers linked to the gas industry.
Just two weeks before, the US had labelled the insurgents as ""ISIS-Mozambique"" and designated it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO).
Four days after the attack, the Islamic State group-aligned Amaq news agency issued a statement claiming that its fighters had attacked Palma and destroyed government offices and banks.
With IS claiming the Palma raid it made headlines.
CBS news called it an ""Isis militant siege"" with hundreds of foreign workers cowering in fear. The UK's Daily Mirror newspaper called it ""Isis terror"" and a ""jihadist massacre"". The UK's Times newspaper had earlier headlined: Isis militants attack town housing foreign workers in Mozambique.
But on the same day, before some of the newspaper headlines were published, the IS claim was debunked.
Jasmine Opperman, Africa analyst at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (Acled), who has been following the insurgency in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province closely, showed that the videos and photos were not from Palma, but from Mocimboa da Praia, 65km to the south.
One of the first things the insurgents now do in attacks is to cut all telecommunications links, mainly by using machetes to cut cables.
In Palma, mobile phone connections went down just 30 minutes after the attack started. So IS and Amaq had no information on the raid. As well as false pictures, the only claims were vague ones that had already been published in international media.
The claim was also the first one about Mozambique from IS or Amaq for five months.
In 2019 the insurgents made links with IS, largely it appears to gain publicity, and did send mobile phone videos. They continued to stress that their target was the government, so a widely published photo shows insurgents with the black IS flag in front of a burned-out district administration building.
But the insurgents continued to use the name given to them by local people, al-Shabab, which simply means ""the youth"" and has no connection with al-Shabab in Somalia.
As Acled, the closest and most trusted monitor of the Cabo Delgado conflict, concluded in a recent report: ""There is no evidence from the Palma attack that IS controls the strategic direction of the insurgency.""
The insurgents are primarily Muslims from the coastal zone of Cabo Delgado, recruited by local fundamentalist preachers with a basically socialist message - that Sharia, or Islamic law, would bring equality and everyone would share in the coming resource wealth.
The first attack was in 2017 on Mocimboa da Praia, the only city and port in this northern zone. The message and the promise of jobs and money led many young men to join the insurgency, and it gained support in local communities.
The war spread to six districts, and five districts capitals - all except Palma - were attacked and occupied for some time. Insurgents have controlled Mocimboa da Praia and the only paved road for a year.
A report based on interviews with women who escaped the insurgents in Palma was published on 12 April by JoÃ£o FeijÃ³, technical director of the Rural Observatory of Mozambique (OMR) and one of the best-informed Mozambican researchers.
The women revealed that some leaders are Tanzanians, some of who claim to be IS, and Somalis, who firmly said they were not IS, but rather part of another unidentified group.
The consensus is that the insurgency started locally and that foreign and IS involvement came later. The disagreement is over how important that is.
The US view is that IS has hijacked the insurgency and taken it over. The view of most Mozambican researchers is that there is foreign and possibly IS involvement, but that al-Shabab is still locally run and retians local goals.
This split leads to a huge division over the response.
The insurgents walked and drove into Palma virtually unopposed, despite clear warnings over two months of an attack when the rains ended, and a government promise to Total to defend Palma.
The army and paramilitary police are poorly trained and equipped, and unmotivated and hugely corrupt.
The insurgents had largely not attacked the installations of Total contractors, and in the first week of April, after the attackers had left Palma, the army looted the city, breaking into contractor facilities.
This was shown both in aerial photos and from first-hand reports from contractors, and even angry local government officials.
There is a big push for a military response.
In an 11 March press conference, John T Godfrey, US Acting Special Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat Isis, said: ""We have to confront Isis in Africa."" The US wants to be involved in Cabo Delgado to confront IS ""terrorist activities"" there.
Portugal is sending trainers and as the current head of the EU Council is pushing for EU involvement. The South African military is already patrolling Mozambique's coast and would like boots on the ground.
This is where the role of IS becomes central.
No country can give the Mozambican government military support to fight its own peasants. But to fight a global enemy like IS provides the justification.
In other words, IS and the US appear to have a common interest in promoting the importance of the jihadist group.
For South Africa, promoters of the IS link warn that with similar levels of poverty in Cape Town, IS could use Cabo Delgado as a basis to move south, so South Africa should send troops. But if the insurgency is just a local peasant uprising, this does not hold.
Mozambique's Frelimo government is extremely anxious that outsiders, and even local media, do not look at the roots of the war and point out how a Frelimo elite has become wealthy while ordinary people in Cabo Delgado became poorer.
On 7 April President Filipe Nyusi said Mozambique needs help ""for the fight against terrorism"". But he added: ""Those who arrive from abroad will not replace us, they will support us. It is a sense of sovereignty.""
Interviews with women who escaped the insurgents in Palma offer an alternative view to the government's.
They said that the fighters have a great resentment towards the authorities, and their motivation is predominantly material - jobs and money. But many would like to leave the armed group if there was an alternative.
More about the conflict in Mozambique:
Dr FeijÃ³, who conducted the interviews, argues that economic development, intensive farming and fishing should be used to attract the disaffected.
The government appears happier to blame IS rather than its own policy failings for the continued conflict. But increasing numbers of Mozambicans are saying that creating thousands of jobs would end the war sooner and cost much less than a huge international military involvement.

219,8,DoS attack,Why do dogs attack their owners?,20 December 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-42424407,"In Virginia, US, a young woman has died in tragic circumstances after being mauled by her own dogs.
Police said Bethany Stephens, 22, was attacked by her two pit bulls while out for a walk - despite having raised them since they were puppies.
Locals were so shocked by the case that the sheriff had to release disturbing details of her death to convince them the dogs were responsible.
What would make a dog turn on its owner so dramatically?
Experts say it's still unclear. But generally speaking, there are several factors that make dogs lash out. Here are some to be aware of.
Sean Wensley, Senior Veterinary Surgeon at the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), says dogs can be aggressive when they feel threatened.
""The motivation for lots of dog bites is fear,"" he says. ""Others are territorial - if they're guarding something that they highly value, or defending their favourite resting place, their bed... Or if they've learned to defend, say, a dog bowl - that can result in aggression.""
Dog behaviourist and trainer Carolyn Menteith notes that many dog bites occur during the holiday season, and often it's not their owner they snap with.
""Christmas can make it worse as people ask people to just stay with their dog while they pop to the shops,"" she says. A houseful of guests descend, excited children are around all day, and walks may fall by the wayside, leaving the dog bored and confused.
""We're a very verbal species, so when we're not feeling comfortable, we say something,"" Ms Menteith says. ""Our dogs only have body language cues to do that with.""
It's easy to miss what they're trying to tell us, especially with a long list of undone Christmas chores.
Regardless of the time of year, owners with more than one dog should check how they behave to each other.
""If there's competitive behaviour between them, that can lead to aggression between the dogs that can potentially be directed at an owner,"" Dr Wensley says.
A generally pleasant dog is more likely to attack if it's in pain - for example if it's encouraged to move out of a doorway, and that tweaks a painful joint.
Liver disease - which affects the brain - and brain tumours can also cause animals to behave unpredictably.
NHS figures for 2014-15 showed that 7,227 people needed medical attention after being ""bitten or struck"" by a dog, with young children the most commonly affected. Some 1,159 under the age of nine were admitted to hospital.
Research published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found that 76% of dog bites to children were to the lips, nose or cheeks, because of their height. Bites to the neck are especially dangerous as a child can bleed to death if their carotid artery is severed.
Dr Wensley says children are potentially alarming for inexperienced dogs. ""A small human who behaves slightly unusually, who maybe squeals and tries to cuddle them, pick them up, wave their hands... can make them quite fearful,"" he says.
Before biting, dogs will usually show several signs of anxiety. They may lick their lips, adopt a low posture, put their ears back, and potentially have their tail under their legs. Children may be unable to read those signals - and many even think a dog baring its teeth is smiling.
Ms Menteith says that when a dog does attack, the owner will often say it bit with no warning. But in its own way, the dog has been trying to say something for months.
""We take dogs into our lives, and then we don't listen to them as dogs,"" she says.
When thinking about whether it's safe to leave your dog with children, or adult strangers, consider its past experiences. Is it used to small people? Can you really trust it to behave without you?
""A problem we see is when young puppies aren't exposed to everyday sights and sounds,"" Dr Wensley says. ""Perhaps they've been reared on a puppy farm in the middle of nowhere, or in a very rural location, and then someone buys them off the internet, meets them at a motorway services, and they're taken to an urban family environment and expected to understand the world they find themselves in.
""They can be extremely anxious and fearful, and that will manifest as aggression.""
Early training is also key to avoiding future aggression - and it's best to start while they're still puppies.",Yes

221,10,DoS attack,Indonesia bombing: Worshippers wounded in Makassar church attack,28 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56553790,"A suspected suicide bomb attack outside a Catholic church in the Indonesian city of Makassar has left at least 14 people wounded, police say.
Police said an explosion erupted as two attackers tried to enter the church on Palm Sunday ahead of Easter.
A destroyed motorbike and body parts were found at the scene and police said the two attackers had died.
Militant Islamists have attacked churches in the past but no group has yet said it was behind the bombing.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo condemned the attack as ""act of terror"" and said he had ordered the chief of police to investigate those responsible.
""I call on everyone to fight against terror and radicalism, which go against religious values,"" the president said.
Religious Affairs Minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas urged police to increase security measures at places of worship.
During a Palm Sunday mass at the Vatican, Pope Francis offered a prayer for the victims of the attack.
The explosion happened at about 10:30 local time (03:30 GMT) at the end of a service for Palm Sunday, the first day of Holy Week before Easter.
""There were two people riding on a motorbike when the explosion happened at the main gate of the church - the perpetrators were trying to enter the compound,"" National Police spokesman Argo Yuwono said.
Later, the country's chief security minister, Mahfud MD, described the attack as ""a suicide bombing"" committed by two people, both of whom had died.
A priest at the church, Father Wilhemus Tulak, told Metro TV that security guards had tackled one suspected bomber.
The attacker, he said, arrived by motorbike and tried to get into the church.
Police said at least 14 people were injured, including the church officials who stopped the attackers from entering the cathedral.
The blast happened by the church's side entrance. Footage from security cameras showed fire, smoke and debris being blown into the middle of the road.
Makassar Mayor Danny Pomanto said that if the explosion had happened at the main entrance, it could have led to far more casualties.
""There were several injured people on the street. I helped one woman who was wounded and covered in blood,"" one witness named only as Yosi told the AFP news agency.
""Her grandchild was also injured. There were body parts everywhere.""
Gomar Gultom, head of the Indonesian Council of Churches, said the attack on people celebrating Palm Sunday was ""cruel"".
He urged people to stay calm and trust the authorities.
Churches have been targeted in the past by extremists in Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation.
In 2018, dozens of people were killed in bomb attacks on churches and a police headquarters in the port city of Surabaya.
Police blamed an Islamic State-inspired network, the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) group, for the attacks.
Indonesia's worst ever terror attack was in Bali in 2002, when 202 people - mostly foreigners - were killed in an attack on a tourist nightlife district.
That attack was carried out by the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) militant network and prompted a sustained crackdown on militants.",Yes
222,11,DoS attack,What to do if you're attacked by a swarm of wasps,27 August 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45272344,"Stephen Cockroft was stung 42 times after accidentally disturbing a wasps' nest in his back garden. Here is what you should do if you are attacked by an angry swarm.
""Initially I thought I had brushed my arm against a stinging nettle but suddenly wasps were all around my upper torso and face.
""I dropped the machine and was desperately flailing my arms around trying to get them off my face.
""Even though I made a run for it they just followed and kept stinging me, they were really aggressive.""
The wasps attacked the 70-year-old, from Delamere in Cheshire, while he was trimming a hedge.
They usually only sting when they feel threatened, said Natalie Bungay, technical officer at the British Pest Control Association (BPCA).
""The problem is a wasp in distress emits a pheromone that sends nearby colony members into a defensive, stinging frenzy,"" said Ms Bungay.
""That's right - scare a wasp and it might call for backup.""
Although it may be easier said than done, NHS advice is not to wave your arms around or swat at wasps but remain calm and move away slowly.
And in case you had any other creative ideas to give them the slip, wasps will not be fooled by anyone who tries to ""play dead"" said Debugged, the blog by pest control giant Rentokil.
""Do not seek shelter in a body of water, as the wasps will simply wait for you to re-emerge,"" it also advised.
Unlike bees, wasps do not die after one sting. They can, and will, sting you quite a few times, said Ms Bungay.
""While being stung by one wasp isn't normally dangerous, 30 or 40 stings could kill you.""
Mr Cockroft said when the ordeal was over he was ""visibly shaking and in pain."" He could not get an on-the-day appointment with his GP so went to A&E.
If you are stung you should pull out any stings left in the skin and wash the area with soap and water, according to NHS advice.
Doctors recommend applying ice or a cold flannel to the site for 10 minutes and elevating the area to reduce swelling.
You can also take over-the-counter remedies such as antihistamines and painkillers.

At hospital, Mr Cockroft was given medication and was kept in for observation to check he did not have an allergic reaction.
""They counted some 42 stings sites, but there were more with some stings still stuck in my skin,"" he said.
""It was a very painful experience and felt like I had received burns to my face, neck, arms and torso.
""After a few hours, the pain eased but it was still very, very uncomfortable.
""Days later prickly sensation with a lot of itching.""

223,12,DoS attack,US Capitol: Police officer dies after car rams security barrier,2 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56620113,"An attack at the US Capitol complex in Washington DC has left one police officer dead and another in hospital with injuries.
A car crashed into a security barrier before the driver lunged towards the officers with a knife, police said.
The officers opened fire and the suspect was shot dead.
Authorities said the attack, which came three months after January's deadly Capitol riots, did not appear to be terrorism-related.
""Whether the attack was at law enforcement, or whoever, we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of it and we'll do that,"" Robert Contee, the acting chief of Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department, said at a news conference.
Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said it was ""with a very, very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries"".
In a later statement, she named the officer as  William ""Billy"" Evans, who had been a member of the Capitol Police for 18 years and was part of the department's first responders unit.
""Please keep Officer Evans and his family in your thoughts and prayers,"" she said.
Two law enforcement sources involved in the investigation told BBC partner CBS News that the suspect in the attack was 25-year-old Noah Green from Indiana.
They said that no prior information about him had been found on any police databases.
In a post from mid-March on a now-deleted Facebook page, Green wrote that he had recently left his job, ""partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey"".   He added he had been suffering the ""side effects of drugs I was intaking unknowingly"" and wrote extensively of his interest in the black nationalist religious organisation, Nation of Islam.
In a statement Facebook said it had designated the incident under its ""Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy"", meaning the suspect's Facebook and Instagram accounts were being removed, as well as any content praising him.
An increased security presence remains around the Capitol building, where the US Congress sits.
As Congress is not currently in session, most politicians were not at the Capitol complex at the time of the attack.
Shortly after 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT) the Capitol Police alert system sent an email to lawmakers and their staff ordering them to stay away from exterior windows and doors due to a threat. Anyone outside was instructed to seek cover.
At that time, a man driving a blue sedan had rammed the car into two officers standing at the North Barricade, according to police.
He exited the vehicle and ran towards the officers - at least one of whom drew a weapon and shot the suspect. The officers were then transported to hospital, one in an ambulance and one in a police cruiser.
Footage of the scene showed a helicopter flying overhead and what appeared to be two people on stretchers being moved into ambulances.
Onlookers were told to clear the area.
Police said the suspect died due to his injuries at 13:30 local time. Chief Contee told reporters the suspect appeared to act alone.
The FBI's Washington Field Office said it was providing support to the Capitol Police.
Analysis by Samantha Granville, US Capitol
Capitol Hill has been tense over the past three months. Since the riot on 6 January, the complex has been like a fortress with barbed wire, metal fencing and heightened security.
But just weeks later, we are back here with blocked roads, extra troops, and a solemn feeling.
Congress is in recess today and staff I have spoken to are grateful to be home and nervous about returning to work after the Easter holiday.
They say, understandably, that it is scary to have your workplace attacked twice in a short space of time.
It is concerning for them that even with ramped up security, an event that led to an officer's death still happened.
US President Joe Biden said he was ""heartbroken to learn of the violent attack"".
He offered his ""heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans' family, and everyone grieving his loss"", and said that he had ordered flags at the White House to be lowered to half mast.
Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said ""America's heart has been broken"" and called Mr Evans ""a martyr for our democracy"".
Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he was ""heartbroken for the officer killed"" and indebted to the Capitol police force.
Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell wrote that he was ""praying"" for those attacked.",Yes

The explosive was attached to a container of flammable liquid next to her car in Dungiven on Monday.
""This was designed to cause a fireball which would have engulfed the victim's car and anyone in it or close by,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan.
Police believe the dissident republican group the New IRA was responsible.
""What is really distressing here is the terrorists placed the bomb at the rear of the car directly at the point where the victim's three-year-old daughter sits,"" said ACC McEwan of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
""This demonstrates the complete and utter disregard for the life of a mother and her toddler - this simply beggars belief.""
First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have described the attempted attack as ""reprehensible"".
""I do give thanks that she has survived this dreadful murder attempt,"" said Mrs Foster, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader.
""When I spoke to this lady earlier I gave her my prayerful support and indeed solidarity at this difficult time.""
""To the republicans who sought to murder this young mother, your campaign is futile, you will never succeed.""
ACC McEwan said dissident republicans were ""still intent on recklessly targeting honest hardworking members of our community"".
""They have no concern at all for those that are killed or harmed in the process,"" he said.
""It's time for people to examine their own conscience and ask themselves whether they support groups who are attempting to kill a three-year-old child and her mother.
""We will be unrelenting in our efforts to bring these people to justice.""
Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne said it was an ""outrageous attack"" on the officer and her family.
Part of Ballyquin Road, which had been closed while police examined the scene, reopened on Tuesday evening.
This sounds like some kind of supercharged incendiary bomb.
It maybe has echoes of more of the improvised devices of the Troubles than what we have come to associate with New IRA attacks of recent years.
In this instance, the police have not disclosed how this bomb was to have been triggered. That is not unusual. They can often hold certain information back and it remains unclear how this bomb was to have been set off.
But for the PSNI this is a secondary fact. They say it was designed create a huge fireball smothering those in its vicinity in flames.
Last summer we saw the alleged leadership of the New IRA arrested following an MI5 bugging operation. Ten people were remanded in custody, accused of 50 serious offences under the Terrorism Act.
However, the group has been re-organising and despite that setback has remained dangerous. The threat level has stayed at severe and in its recent Easter message the New IRA vowed to continue its campaign.
But until today you had to go back more than a year since the last New IRA attack on police.
While the guard has not been down, the PSNI will undoubtedly be concerned the organisation has resurfaced in terms of attacks on its officers.
Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described the attempted attack as a ""shocking and deplorable attempt on the life of a police officer that will rightly be reviled across the community"".
""Those behind this reckless attack have absolutely nothing to offer society and have shown a callous disregard for the entire community,"" said the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president.
""They seek only to drag our communities backwards; they have no place in our society and they should disband.""
Justice Minister Naomi Long said it was a ""despicable and cowardly act"".
The Alliance Party leader added: ""When a device explodes, it does not discriminate. It does not pick and choose who it injures or who it kills.
""The people who sneaked around in the dark to plant this device have shown an utter disregard for human life, not only for this officer but for others living in the area or who may have been passing by.""
The Police Federation for Northern Ireland said the officer's dedication ""to serving the community"" was in stark contrast ""to those who offer nothing but death and destruction"".
""Society has moved on and those engaged in such activity need to be consigned to the past,"" the federation added.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: ""I want to convey my support for the officer concerned.
""Those who try to attack public servants have nothing to offer the communities they claim to represent.""
Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said it was a ""cowardly attempt on the life of someone who is courageously putting her selflessness to the good of all of our community"".
SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said the attempted attack was disgraceful.
""Those responsible and their warped agenda are putting police officers and our community in danger,"" he added.",Yes
225,14,DoS attack,Sweden attack: Seven hurt in Vetlanda stabbing attack,3 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56272565,"A man has injured seven people, three seriously, in a knife attack in a town in southern Sweden.
The 22-year-old assailant struck in the centre of Vetlanda at about 15:00 (14:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
Police are treating the case as attempted murder but have not ruled out a terror motive.
The suspect was shot in the leg by officers but is in a stable condition in hospital and has been questioned by police.
At a news conference, police said the man was arrested with a knife in his hand, and confirmed he is an Afghan citizen. The suspect moved to Sweden in 2018, local media said.
According to the local police chief, he was previously known to law enforcement agencies but was only suspected of ""petty crimes"", AFP news agency reports.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said the ""horrific violence"" was a reminder of ""how frail our safe existence is"".
""We face these despicable actions with the combined force of the community,"" he posted on Facebook.
Police say investigations are ongoing into whether there is a terror motive linked with the attack. This is at odds with prosecutors, who earlier said terrorism had been ruled out.
Officers raided an apartment in Vetlanda, believed to be the man's home. They took away evidence and spoke to neighbours.
Extra police officers have been put on patrol in the area.
Five different crime scenes, a few hundred metres apart, were identified, local police chief Jonas Lindell said.
One eyewitness, florist Asa Karlqvist, told local newspaper Vetlanda-Posten: ""We heard a scream from the street. Then we saw a man enter the store, shouting that he had been stabbed.
""Blood was pouring from his shoulder, so we got towels and applied pressure on the wound.""
The suspect was shot and arrested within minutes of the first emergency call.
Local resident Olivia Strandberg told SVT she had seen from her window the suspect being taken away.
""I had just gotten to my apartment when my best friend wrote me and said, 'Don't go out!'"" she said.",Yes
226,15,DoS attack,Scottish countryside care plea as lockdown rules ease,31 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-56591209,"A plea has been made to the public to respect Scotland's countryside over the Easter period.
Scottish Land and Estates (SLE) - which represents farms, managers and businesses - urged people to tidy up and take care around animals.
It highlighted issues of littering, anti-social behaviour and fly tipping during the coronavirus pandemic.
As lockdown restrictions ease from Friday, countryside visitor numbers are expected to rise.
SLE chief executive Sarah-Jane Laing said: ""With restrictions just beginning to ease, we still expect many people to be spending their free time out walking in the countryside.
""Our message on behalf of farmers and land managers is to enjoy our rural areas but remember to do so responsibly and respectfully.""
She said it was a ""hugely important"" time for farms and estates with many lambs and calves arriving.
NFU Scotland issued a similar warning, encouraging ""responsible dog walking"" in the countryside.
It followed an ""alarmingly high"" number of dog attacks on pregnant sheep in the south of Scotland.
Ms Laing said it was also vital that visitors tidied up after themselves.
She added: ""The last year has seen a huge increase in anti-social behaviour and that has come at a significant cost to rural communities and businesses that have had to clean up after inconsiderate visitors.
""Getting out in the fresh air is great for all of us, especially for our mental and physical wellbeing.
""Rural Scotland will be welcoming to visitors and access takers - we just ask the public to be mindful to take care in the countryside over the Easter period and in the months that lie ahead.""",Yes

229,18,DoS attack,Manchester Arena Inquiry: Officer accepts police control room failings,30 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-56575815,"A police fixation with getting armed units to the Manchester Arena after it was bombed impacted the wider emergency response, an inquiry has heard.
The Manchester Arena Inquiry was told the former police control room manager accepted his staff did not communicate well with responders after the blast.
Ch Insp Mike Booth said his belief that staff had enough support to deal with such an attack had been ""incorrect"".
He was not on duty on the night of the 2017 attack.
The inquiry has been told that it was the police's job to inform and update other  responders during a major incident, such as the bombing, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.
Giving evidence, Ch Insp Booth said he ""would have hoped"" staff in the control room ""would have been aware of the responsibilities"".
""Clearly, with hindsight, some further embedding of that would have been extremely useful,"" he said.
""I maintain that at the time I believed the additional support available to them would have been sufficient.
""Clearly, as it's played out in a real-life incidentâ¦ my original assumption proved to be incorrect.""
However, he said he did not think the importance of triggering other emergency responders ""fell off the radar"".
He said police first aid skills were ""limited compared to those of fire and ambulance service, so certainly they were and remain a key element of responding to a major incident"".
""We realise we can't do it all ourselves,"" he added.
Pete Weatherby QC, who represents some of the bereaved families, asked him if the police's preoccupation with getting armed officers to the scene of the arena attack came to the detriment of involving other emergency services in the response.
""It appears that way, yes,"" he replied.
The inquiry heard that in November 2016, inspectors found there were shortcomings in how Greater Manchester Police (GMP) control room staff would be able to cope in the event of a terrorist attack.
Ch Insp Booth said his seniors did not tell him the specific findings of that inspection report and if had been ""aware of the lack of knowledge... then obviously I could have reflected on what other activity could have taken place to bolster that knowledge"".
The hearing was also told that in the year before the bombing, Ch Insp Booth created ""action cards"" which gave police control room staff simple clear reminders of what they needed to do during a terrorist attack.
The idea was that the cards would help take the pressure off the police force duty officer (FDO), who is initially responsible for co-ordinating the emergency response to any major incident.
The hearing was told that despite him doing his ""level best"", nothing was done within Greater Manchester Police to make sure the action cards were used by control room staff.
The inquiry continues.

231,20,DoS attack,Surviving a shark attack: Do you really have to punch it?,14 November 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-41981379,"Apparently if you're attacked by a shark, it helps to have read the news.
Fortunately for surfer Charlie Fry, when a 2m (6.5ft) long shark launched at him on a beach near Sydney, he remembered a famous survival story.
The source - Australian pro surfer Mick Fanning, who punched a shark in the back live on TV during a competition in South Africa.
Both men were lucky enough to escape with their lives. But is punching the predator really the best way out of that situation?
We got some expert advice on how to survive a shark attack...
Ryan Johnson is a shark researcher and documentary maker who studies great whites. He told the BBC it depends if the animal is checking you out, or has gone in for the kill.
""From my experience free-diving with white sharks - if you're in that situation where you are getting attacked, you have to do everything in your power,"" he said. ""Punching him in the face, going for his eyes, try to keep your hands out of his mouth.
""If you start touching them around the snout, they can pick up your electro-receptions and they know you're possibly edible.""
He advises using ""something hard - be it a camera, a stick, a rock"" - to push the animal away.
""In a situation where you don't have that, going for the face and the gills and trying to keep your hands out of its mouth is always the best thing.""
If there's a shark nearby, surely the best thing is to get away as fast as possible? Actually, no...
""The worst thing is to try to run away,"" Mr Johnson advises. ""It's like throwing a stick for a dog. Fleeing often can entice a shark... Standing your ground and trying to make yourself big and going vertical in the water is always the best response to make a shark keep its distance from you.""
Conservationist and wildlife author Richard Peirce, who lives between Africa and the UK, has had many sharks approach ""closer than I was happy with"", and agrees the best deterrent is a shove to the nose from a heavy object - perhaps a camera, or a shark ""billy"" - basically a sharpened stick about two or three feet long.
What about a knife?
""Gosh, no! Hopeless, hopeless,"" he says. ""All you're going to do is excite the animal. You've got a little knife four, six, eight inches long, and you've got a two or three or four metre white shark or a three or four metre tiger shark... There's no chance whatsoever of fighting the shark. And if you do start it bleeding, you could well attract other animals in...""
Doesn't really bear thinking about...
Absolutely. If you're diving in shark-inhabited waters, make sure you're in a pair. That way if a shark shows up, you can keep the animal in sight.
""The shark is an apex predator,"" Mr Peirce notes. ""It's an ambush predator. If they know that you're watching, they will circle you - and that's happened to me loads of times - but what you do, basically, is try to slowly swim back together.""
So once again, despite every instinct - don't panic, don't splash.
""A great white doesn't want a mouthful of wetsuit and sinew - we're not on the menu, it's just curiosity. Sharks exhibit body language, just like a dog. You know when that dog's starting to growl, bare its teeth - and it's exactly the same with a shark. When that happens, you've got to be calm.""
""Don't swim at dawn or dusk,"" Mr Peirce advises. ""Those are the times that sharks can make mistakes. And those are also prime hunting times.
""And you wouldn't swim in an estuary situation. Bull sharks live in fresh water and sea water. You wouldn't swim anywhere near a fishing boat, because they could be discarding guts and bits of old fish - all of which will bring in sharks and put them in feeding mode.""
There are over 400 species of shark, and around a dozen are considered highly dangerous to humans - chiefly the great white, tiger shark and bull shark.
The chances of dying in a shark attack are definitely extremely slim. The Florida Museum of Natural History puts the odds of a fatal attack at about 1 in 3,748,067.
But of course, the risk depends on your habits - surfers are obviously more likely to run into a fin than those who rarely set foot in the sea, as Surfer.com estimated.
It also depends where you are. The coasts of South Africa, Brazil, Hawaii, and Fiji are all shark territory, while in the US Florida and California are most affected.
There have been 18 shark attacks - including one fatal incident - in Australia this year, according to the Australian Shark Attack File,
But overall, sharks are at much greater risk from humans than we are from them. Some estimates suggest an astonishing 100 million die due to human activity every year - or around 11,000 an hour.",Yes
232,21,DoS attack,Iran nuclear attack: Mystery surrounds nuclear sabotage at Natanz,12 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-56722181,"Within hours of Iran proudly announcing the launch of its latest centrifuges, a power blackout damaged some of the precious machines at its site in Natanz.
Iran has described this as an act of ""terrorism"" and pointed the finger at Israel. But there is still mystery over the cause.
In Israel, some reports have suggested a cyber-attack might have been responsible but Iran has talked of ""infiltrators"" amid reports of an explosion linked to the power generator.
One thing reports seem to agree on is that an ""incident"" affected the power distribution network at Natanz, leading to a blackout until emergency power systems kicked in.
A blackout may not sound that serious, but it can be at an enrichment plant. Centrifuges are slender machines linked up in what are called cascades which enrich uranium gas by spinning it at incredibly high speeds using rotors. The stress on the advanced materials involved is intense and the process is technically immensely challenging.
A small problem can send a centrifuge spinning out of control, with parts smashing into each other and damaging a whole cascade.
Ensuring the power supply reaching a centrifuge is perfectly balanced is vital. Which means sabotage of that supply can be catastrophic.
The question is: what caused it - a cyber-attack or a physical act of sabotage, like a bomb?
The speculation of cyber-attack comes because Natanz is Ground Zero for cyber-war - the place where the world's first real cyber-attack took place a decade ago.
Most events called cyber-attacks are not really attacks in the physical sense - they are thefts of data. But Stuxnet - the name given to the incident that targeted Iran's nuclear programme over a decade ago - is not just one of the few exceptions but arguably also the first demonstration of what such a cyber-attack looks like.
In that case, computer codes caused real-word damage by interfering with the centrifuge controllers to spin them out of control (and even relaying false messages back to those monitoring them so they would not worry until it was too late). The result was what sounded like a slow-motion explosion as centrifuges crashed into each other. It was an incredibly sophisticated and targeted operation, run jointly by the US and Israel and developed over a period of years.
But that does not mean that a cyber-attack has to be responsible this time. Iran invested heavily in cyber-defence and offense after Stuxnet making such an attack much harder and doing more to protect its systems, including the power supply.
Stuxnet showed the separation between online and physical attacks could be blurry - a cyber incident could cause real-world damage. But it also worked the other way - cyber-attacks sometimes required real-world help. Some of the versions of Stuxnet are believed to have required a person to physically insert a USB into a machine in order to get access to the Iranian system. And a physical act of sabotage might be accompanied by a cyber-intrusion to black out the power or alarm systems.
And there is also precedent for some kind of physical sabotage.
Last summer, a previously unknown group calling itself the Homeland Tigers said it was behind a blast which affected a building above ground at Natanz (most of the sensitive work is underground). Statements were sent to the BBC, as well as others, claiming the group were disaffected Iranians and promising more attacks would come. Many at the time assumed Israel was involved in some way, not least because the country has also been linked to the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists.
In the immediate aftermath of an incident, reports are often conflicting and hazy. There can also deliberate disinformation - sometimes a country like Israel might prefer it to appear that a cyber-incident was involved to protect anyone who infiltrated the site. And Iran itself may either not know, or want to reveal all it knows.
The details are likely to become clearer in the coming days, with more reports pointing towards an explosion at the power supply rather than simply a cyber-incident. But whatever the cause, previous incidents of either online or physical sabotage have only led to temporary setbacks for the Iranian nuclear programme. And this time Iran has again insisted it will push forwards with its work at Natanz.",Yes
233,22,DoS attack,"Hack of '150,000 cameras' investigated by camera firm",10 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56342525,"A hack of up to 150,000 security cameras installed in schools, hospitals and businesses is being investigated by the firm that makes them.
Hackers claim to have breached Verkada, a security company that provides cameras to companies including Tesla.
Bloomberg reported feeds from prisons, psychiatric hospitals, clinics, and Verkada's own offices were hijacked.
Verkada told the BBC it was ""investigating the scale and scope of this issue"".
The company added it had notified law enforcement. However, it did not confirm the size and scale of the attack.
Reuters has also reported that the transport start-up Virgin Hyperloop was among the list of impacted user accounts disclosed by the hackers.
Software provider Cloudflare told the BBC that it had been alerted to a ""handful"" of cameras that might have been compromised at its offices around the world.
A Verkada camera inside a Florida hospital, reportedly seen by Bloomberg, showed what appeared to be eight workers tackling a man and pinning him to a bed.
Another video showed officers in a police station in Stoughton, Massachusetts questioning a man in handcuffs.
One, inside a Tesla warehouse in Shanghai, showed people working on an assembly line.
The BBC has not been able to independently verify these videos.
The hackers also said they had gained access to the security cameras of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed more than 20 people in 2012.
Speaking to Bloomberg, Tille Kottmann claimed credit for hacking into Verkada's systems.
The reasons for the hack, Kottmann said, were, ""lots of curiosity, fighting for freedom of information and against intellectual property, a huge dose of anti-capitalism, a hint of anarchism - and it's also just too much fun not to do it"".
The attack was reportedly unsophisticated, involving use of a ""super admin"" account to gain access to Verkada.
Bloomberg said that after they had contacted Verkada, the hackers lost access to the video feeds and archives.
A spokesperson for Verkada told the BBC: ""We have disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent any unauthorised access.
""Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this issue, and we have notified law enforcement.""
The company has also set up a support line for their customers.
Meanwhile Cloudflare told the BBC: ""This afternoon we were alerted that the Verkada security camera system that monitors main entry points and main thoroughfares in a handful of Cloudflare offices may have been compromised.
""The cameras were located in a handful of offices that have been officially closed for several months.""
Tesla has yet to comment.

236,25,DoS attack,Douma 'attack': How do you test for chemical weapons?,18 April 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43801091,"A week after they gathered in Syria, inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are finally gaining access to the site of an alleged chemical attack in the town of Douma.
Rescue workers and opposition activists say government aircraft dropped barrel bombs filled with toxic chemicals on Douma on 7 April, killing more than 40 people and injuring hundreds more.
Medics reported seeing patients with symptoms including foaming at the mouth, blue skin and lips, corneal burns and convulsions, which they said indicated exposure to chlorine and possibly a nerve agent.
The government and its ally, Russia, said the incident was staged, but requested that an OPCW Fact-Finding Mission investigate the allegations.
For the inspectors, getting into Douma is the first hurdle. When they arrive they will face many more. How do you gather evidence of a chemical weapon attack, almost a fortnight after it happened, in an environment controlled by forces accused of perpetrating the alleged attack?
The inspectors will be looking for three types of evidence: environmental, biomedical and documentary, said Hamish de Bretton Gordon, a British chemical weapons expert who has investigated previous attacks in Syria.
Environmental evidence could include debris from munitions, as well as soil samples and chips of concrete from buildings. Biomedical evidence includes blood, hair and urine from victims. Documentary evidence - witness testimony, footage, and social media posts.
""If they find any weapon debris they will be swabbing it for samples,"" Mr de Bretton-Gordon said. ""They will be interviewing as many people as they can, and attempting to verify the veracity of those witnesses. And they will be trying to find the injured and the dead.""
That was key, he said - the injured and the dead. Biomedical samples provide the most reliable evidence of the use of chemical agents.
""Urine can be good for identifying the presence of chlorine,"" he said. ""And blood samples will show the presence of a nerve agent, as will hair.""
The nerve agent Sarin was used in an attack that killed hundreds of people in the Ghouta region outside Damascus in August 2013. In that case, OPCW experts gained access to the affected areas after two days as part of a UN mission. They collected a significant amount of biomedical evidence from survivors, as well as environmental samples.
Angela Kane, a former UN high representative for disarmament affairs, led the mission.
""What we found in Ghouta was a very complex composite of Sarin,"" Ms Kane said. ""In its very pure form, Sarin evaporates very quickly, making it hard to detect. But in 2013 the Sarin was cut with other chemicals which meant that it stayed a lot longer on the ground.""
Finding proof of the allegations made by the residents of Douma may be more difficult. On Tuesday, the US state department warned that the delays in getting the OPCW inspectors into the town would ""further degrade"" any evidence on the ground.
Russian military personnel are believed to have visited the attack site last week as rebel fighters were being evacuated. The US ambassador to the OPCW said he feared they might have ""tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission"".
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied any interference.
In theory, if you wanted to clean up a chemical attack site, the first thing to do would be to locate and remove any debris from the munitions, Mr de Bretton-Gordon said. Then you would scrub down and clean anything contaminated by the chemical agents. Counter-intuitively, a chlorine-based solution is often used.
You might also attempt to silence or remove witnesses from the location. A Guardian newspaper report on Wednesday suggested that medics in Douma had been threatened and had their WhatsApp conversations inspected.
Another source of evidence is the dead. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention, OPCW inspectors should have access to any piece of evidence they want, including corpses. But first the bodies have to be found.
""If the inspectors find no bodies, that tells you something,"" Mr de Bretton-Gordon said. ""If those bodies have disappeared, that would be a very strong indication that something was very wrong.""
In Douma, investigators will need to perform all of this work in an environment controlled by Syrian government and Russian forces. Filming everything as the work was carried out was key, said Ms Kane, as well as tightly securing any evidence.
""Those samples have to remain in your custody at all times,"" she said. ""You never let them leave your sight, wherever you are, onto the plane, all the way to the the laboratory.""",Yes

238,27,DoS attack,Do attack ads crush the opposition?,6 October 2010,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11473185,"It's less than a month until the US mid-term elections and that means adverts that knock the opposition are coming thick and fast. But do the ""attack ads"" work and what makes a good one?
Attack ads are not a uniquely American institution but many of the most powerful examples have come from the US.
Lyndon Johnson's campaign advert Daisy, despite only being shown once, played a part in his landslide victory over Barry Goldwater in 1964.
Its ominous invocation of the dangers of nuclear war generated controversy.
But nearly five decades on many political scientists believe that negative advertising works. It can complement positive advertising at different stages of a campaign.
""Early in the campaign you will see a lot of positive advertising as a candidate introduces himself,"" says Prof Stephen Ansolabehere, of Harvard University, and co-author of Going Negative: How Political Advertising Alienates and Polarizes the American Electorate.
""What's then left is to try and discredit the other guy. Later in the campaign you see them trying to call attention to the failings.
""It could be issues, it could be scandals.""
The Daisy ad from 1964 didn't even mention Johnson's opponent. It was left to the viewer to infer that the meaning was that Goldwater's policies could lead to cataclysm.
The crop of 2010 are usually quicker to name the target.
Those attack ads that are intended for television are often only 30 seconds long.
They can target the private life or moral rectitude of the opponent. Louisiana congressman Charlie Melancon decided to take this tack in an advert against incumbent Senator David Vitter.
In July 2007, Mr Vitter's phone number cropped up in phone records linked to a Washington DC brothel. Mr Vitter apologised for a ""very serious sin"" but would give no further details.
Mr Melancon's advert - in the style of a true-crime TV show - returns to these and subsequent allegations.
But this can be a dangerous type of attack, even in today's brutal political arena.
""I can imagine there are consultants who say 'your opponent is an adulterer or your opponent is a witch we have to hammer that home',"" says Prof Michael Franz, of Bowdoin College, co-author of Campaign Advertising and American Democracy.
""That is where the political scientists would say that is dangerous waters. Voters sometimes don't like that style of attack and they could punish the sponsor of it.""
And attacks on the views of the opponent also have the possibility to backfire.
One of the most controversial ads of the run-up to the mid-terms so far is Florida Democrat congressman Alan Grayson's attack on his Republican opponent Dan Webster.
A string of headlines about Mr Webster's stance on women, and audio clips of him talking, culminates in the legend ""Taliban Dan Webster"" written in vaguely Arabic looking script.
It drew fire with critics saying it had taken Mr Webster's comments out of context and edited them misleadingly.
A poll highlighted in the New York Times suggests Mr Grayson lost much support in just one week after the release of the ad.
This year's US primaries saw some fruity adverts, with the Demon Sheep ad already notorious in the field of attack ads. Carly Fiorina attacked her Republican rival's fiscal credentials.
But who would have thought that such mainstream subject matter could result in an internet video featuring a man dressed as a sheep sporting demon eyes? It generated criticism but also much buzz.
Having dealt with her Republican rival, Ms Fiorina must now deal with incumbent Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer.
Her strategy involves both short ads like her criticism of Ms Boxer for insisting on being addressed as ""senator"" and longer internet ads like the extraordinary Hot Air: The Movie, which depicts Ms Boxer as a giant hot air balloon of egotism.
Ms Boxer's own most recent attack ad focuses on Ms Fiorina's record as an executive with Hewlett-Packard, outsourcing jobs to China.
It's a battle royale in much the same way as the fight between billionaire Meg Whitman and veteran Jerry Brown for the office of governor. Ms Whitman has used the words of Democrat President Bill Clinton to damn Mr Brown.
And Mr Brown  has been able to respond with an attack on Ms Whitman's record as an Ebay executive.
Third party adverts can be even more vicious.
""In this election, there will be more third party advertising. Third party adverts tend to be more negative,"" says Prof Ansolabehere.
This advert from the National Republican Senate Committee is an example, attacking Illinois Democrat Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias for having links to organised crime through his brother.
The best are short and pithy, says Prof Ansolabehere, with Connecticut Republican Senate candidate Linda McMahon's attack on her Democrat opponent being a good example.
""That is a pretty good character attack, straightforward, grainy black and white images.
""A 30 second advert is four or five sentences. It is a little tiny narrative about the candidate.""
Democrat rival Richard Blumenthal's own ads again take advantage of his opponent's business background.
While there are many who believe negative ads can work, particularly to focus attention on a particular policy issue, it's not easy to quantify precisely how well they work.
This applies even for those adverts widely perceived to have been successful. One such example was the Willie Horton ad from 1988, in which it was suggested that Democrat presidential candidate Michael Dukakis had supported a policy which allowed a ""weekend pass "" for a murderer who went on to commit a rape.
""There is a debate among historians about the Willie Horton ad,"" says Prof Franz. ""Some people say that was a successful attack adâ¦ but it may have worked against [President George HW] Bush.""
And while efforts are made to research what topics will hurt the opponent, it's not an exact science.
""There is some testing of these messages through focus groups. I don't think there is prevailing wisdom about the attacks that work,"" says Prof Franz
Fred Davis, chief executive of the Republican-oriented media firm, Strategic Perception, oversaw both the Hot Air and Demon Sheep web films and believes a successful attack ad is now simply one that gets people talking.
""It doesn't just run and go in one ear and out the other - it jolts them and makes them think. You want everybody the next day talking about your ad.""
The rise of YouTube means a successful media strategy is now a mix of 30-second television adverts and longer clips aimed at viral web success.
But the spirit of the attack remains the same.",Yes
239,28,DoS attack,What should you do in an attack?,19 November 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34844518,"Attacks of the magnitude of those that took place in Paris, killing 130 people and injuring more than 400, are extremely rare. The authorities do prepare for these emergencies but what advice is there for ordinary people?
Many survivors of the Paris attacks have said that they mistook the first gunshots for fireworks. This is typical, says John Leach, survival psychologist and military survival instructor.
People who are not expecting gunshots will assume that they are something else because it does not fit in with their expectations.  ""We respond to the model in our head and we don't respond directly to the environment and that is what makes us vulnerable,"" he says.
The time it can take to understand what is happening can be lethal. But if someone has already thought through a few worst-case scenarios then this process will be quicker. ""All you need to ask is - if anything goes wrong, what is my first response going to be?"" explains Leach.
It's easy to sit in a restaurant or cinema without paying any attention to the emergency exits. But knowing where they are can save lives.  In the attack on the Bataclan concert hall on Friday,  a security guard led a group of people to safety through the fire exit on the left of the stage.
The vast majority of people will be too confused to do anything during an attack.  Leach has looked at life-threatening situations around the world and has found that only 15% of people will respond in a way that helps them survive. Up to 75% will just be too bewildered by what is happening around them to react at all.  The other 10% will react in ways that reduce their chances of survival and get in the way of other people, he says.
Acting decisively might make survival more likely. But it's also human nature to wait for other people to act first. In a classic experiment, psychologists put people in a room and filled it with smoke to see how they would react. People who were on their own were more likely to take action than those who were with other people.
""Where there's cover from sight, there's cover from fire,"" advises Ian Reed, a former British soldier, military instructor and chief executive of the Formative Group security firm. The first thing is to try to get out of the way and make yourself a smaller target. This can involve simply dropping to the ground but ideally means getting behind some sort of cover.
Hard cover such as a concrete wall is the best option. ""Obviously, Hollywood has portrayed cars as being bulletproof but that's not necessarily the case,"" says Reed. Despite this, even a car is better than nothing at all.
When an attack happens in a tightly packed space, a single bullet can end up injuring several people. Keeping out of sight reduces the risk that you can be targeted deliberately and also the chances of being hit by someone simply spraying the room with fire.
Many survivors in Paris did this instinctively - turning tables over to use as makeshift shelters or hiding behind speakers in the concert hall. But the lack of cover on the main floor of the Bataclan meant not everyone there was able to hide.
An Irish couple survived by playing dead. Another survivor, Theresa Cede, told the BBC: ""One guy was badly hurt, and moaning, so we tried to say: 'Shh, be quiet, stay alive and don't move,' because every time there was movement somewhere, there were more gunshots.""
""They are looking for movement - it will catch their eye,"" explains Reed. This is especially true if it's dark. Some people in the Bataclan did run for the exit when the attackers paused to reload. This can be risky, but in some scenarios running away is a good idea.
The UK government's advice, in its document on ""dynamic lockdowns"", is to run if there is a safe route out. But if there is no safe way to do this it advises hiding. The advice is summarised as ""run, hide, tell"".
According to eyewitnesses on Friday, several people chose to stay hidden in offices and toilets until help arrived.
In January, 24-year-old Lassana Bathily was hailed a hero after hiding Jewish shoppers in a basement cold store during an attack by an Islamist gunman. He switched off the fridge and the lights and ran to get help. All of those he hid survived.
Rushing a gunman has worked in some situations. In August, a train attack was foiled in France after passengers overpowered the lone gunman. But of the four passengers involved in subduing him, one was in the Air Force and another in the National Guard. The men only made the attempt after the shooter's weapon jammed.
Reed says that it's not a good idea to take on an assailant without training. ""It's just risking your life,"" he adds. It's important to remember that many attackers will be working in teams. Some will be wearing body armour and others could be carrying explosives.
Adel Termos is thought to have saved dozens of lives in Beirut last week after he tackled a bomber from behind. But the suicide vest exploded and both Termos and the bomber died in the blast.
Despite the dangers, some people argue that it's important to be ready to fight if necessary. Members of the Islamic State group are not motivated by taking hostages, says James Alvarez, psychologist and hostage negotiator. ""There's nobody to negotiate with. Your value lies in you being dead. If I know that I'm going to be shot, I'd like to think that I'm not going to go down quietly.""
Once someone has managed to escape the situation it's important for them to remain vigilant. ""Get as far away as possible, behind as much hard cover as possible and go to the nearest authority figures for help,"" says Reed.
It can be dangerous to join big groups nearby and to take public transport. ""Always assume that there's going to be a secondary device or action,"" adds Reed. The key is to take advice from police officers or other officials, as they may have better knowledge of the situation.
The chances of being caught up in a major attack are still low. But if it does happen, co-operating with others can increase people's chance of survival, says Chris Cocking, social psychologist and expert in crowd behaviour.
After the 7/7 London attacks, Cocking helped interview dozens of people involved and concluded that the quickest and most efficient way for a group to evacuate is for people to work together.
This is the only way to avoid situations such as a crowd getting jammed at a fire escape. Cocking says that most people are likely to try to help each other even in extreme situations. ""There's an assumption that it's everybody for themselves but that just doesn't happen,"" he says.

240,29,DoS attack,How do you stop sharks attacking?,19 April 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-39639387,"How do you stop a great white shark, a creature that can grow up to six metres in length and weigh more than a tonne?
It is a question that has dogged authorities in those countries where people suffer attacks by sharks (great white and others). Attacks continue to happen, and as long as they do, so will the calls for preventative measures.
In the latest case, Laeticia Brouwer, 17, was fatally attacked by a shark on Monday while surfing off Western Australia.
In response, Australia's Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg has said he would consider new proposals, including culling, adding that the government ""would welcome any proposal to put human life first"".
On Thursday, the Senate environmental committee will hold a hearing - already planned before Laeticia Brouwer's death - on shark mitigation strategies.
But what are the possible solutions? Do they make sense? And are shark attacks a big enough problem to warrant such measures?
A shark shield is a device that lets out an electromagnetic pulse to deter sharks, and the Western Australia (WA) government has proposed offering a subsidy of A$200 (Â£117; $150) to anyone wanting to buy one (this is roughly equivalent to a third of the cost of the device).
On the other hand, the WA opposition says shields would remain prohibitively expensive to most people, even with a discount.
The University of Western Australia's Oceans Institute has been tasked with testing different shark deterrents by Australia's federal government.
Speaking to media on Wednesday, Prof Shaun Collin, the institute's director, said a shark shield proved to be an effective deterrent in 400 tests of an ""investigative"" shark attack - in which the shark approaches prey to assess what it is.
However, he said the shields proved ineffective in ""ambush"" attacks, in which the shark swims at speed from deep on seeing a silhouette - possibly of a surfer.
Can science stop sharks attacking humans?
A shark net is stretched through the water to try and separate swimmers and surfers from what may try and approach them. They are not new at all, having been used across Australia for decades.
The New South Wales government ran a trial with a net from 2015-16 and, in one aspect, it proved successful - it caught 133 sharks in that time.
The down side? A government report showed 615 other marine animals were caught, including 90 threatened or protected species. Close to half of them died after being caught in the netting.
The nets have been called cruel by campaigners, and have been cut by activists.
Why the jump in NSW shark attacks?
This method, too, has been attacked as cruel - it is a baited hook suspended underwater and tied to a float on the surface of the water.
It is also anchored to the sea bed, meaning the shark has nowhere to go once it has taken the bait. Larger sharks are often shot; smaller ones released. It was a policy pushed in Western Australia under the state's previous government and has been used in other Australian states.
There was some controversy that drum lines were not put in place on the beach where Laeticia Brouwer died.
But many also question their effectiveness - including the government now in place in WA.
On Tuesday, the state's Fisheries Minister Dave Kelly told ABC: ""We made it clear in opposition that we don't see the merit in automatically deploying drum lines, because they don't actually make our beaches any safer.
""We want to focus on individual shark deterrence, which can actually provide genuine protection for the people who are most at risk.""
The possibility of an active cull - not just killing sharks caught in drum lines - was one raised by Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg on Wednesday.
And while Australia's government is committed to a programme of conserving shark populations, and proposals of culls are generally met with protests, there is some support for a targeted cull.
An editorial in the centre-right The Australian newspaper by its surf writer, written after Laeticia Brouwer's death, said ""our insane shark conservation policies have cost another life"", adding that there was blood on the hands of the government.
Shark cull divides a nation
There are plenty of solutions on the table - but just how big a problem are shark attacks in Australia?
When Laeticia Brouwer was attacked near Esperance on Monday, she became the 15th person to be killed by a shark in Western Australia since 2000, but the first in the country since June last year.
The number of shark attacks in Australia - including fatal and non-fatal - has risen over the past century, but in a way that is consistent with how Australia's population has grown.
But, as horrific as those incidents are for everyone affected, there is, on average, only one death due to a shark attack in Australia every year.
The number of people killed by a shark in Australian waters has changed little over the years despite the country's population - and tourist numbers - booming.
In 1950, when there were 8.3m people living in Australia, two people were killed by sharks. Last year, with a population of more than 24m, there were still only two fatalities.
John G West, who runs the Australian Shark Attack File, which reports all attacks for the Taronga Conservation Society, says the chances of being killed by a shark now are much slimmer than in previous years.
In a 2011 report, he said the number of attacks that were fatal fell from 45% in the 1930s to 10% in the decade leading up to 2011.
But while human populations have grown, he points out that the number of sharks has fallen.
One thing, though, seems sure.
""Encounters with sharks, although a rare event, will continue to occur if humans continue to enter the ocean professionally or for recreational pursuit,"" Mr West writes.",Yes
241,30,DoS attack,Do terror attacks in the Western world get more attention than others?,25 March 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-35886051,"Do some terror attacks get more attention online and from the news media simply because they happen in the Western world?
It's become depressingly familiar. Each time there is a terror attack, millions grieve and an online shock wave ripples out. Breaking news of a bombing or shooting is immediately met with a stream of hashtags online: the name of the city, drawings of its famous monuments, ""Pray forâ¦""
Almost immediately after that - often while people are still physically suffering in the streets or in hospital - come emotive political arguments - often about the Islamic faith, foreign policy, migration and even things like Nato and the European Union.
One specific allegation often levelled on social media is that terrorist attacks outside Western Europe and North America are routinely ignored both by social media users and traditional news outlets. After the November 2015 attacks in Paris, for instance, one of the most read articles on the BBC website was about a seven-month-old attack in Kenya. Many people, it appears, were sharing the story to make a point.
And a similar line of thought developed after Tuesday's attacks in Brussels. Online news outlets picked up on the chatter with headlines like ""Why Brussels mattered and Istanbul didn't"" and ""These Attacks Happened Days Before Brussels â But You Probably Didn't Hear About Them"".
But is it really true? Are people on social networks - and the news media - really ""muted"" or even ""silent"" when bombs kill people in Turkey or Kenya?
Let's consider social media first.
In the days following Tuesday's attacks, ""Pray for Brussels"" or ""Pray for Belgium"" was tweeted about 650,000 times. The equivalent figure for the 19 March Istanbul bombing, including ""Pray for Turkey"" and ""Pray for Ankara"", was about 400,000. (Those figures include mentions of the phrases in French and Turkish.)
The English and French names for Brussels also spiked on Twitter and were used more than 6 million times after Tuesday. After the Istanbul bomb, ""Turkey"" and ""Istanbul"" were tweeted 2.2 million times.
Keep in mind these are only rough approximations (for instance, many messages might include city and country names without referencing attacks). But we can draw some conclusions. The numbers aren't equal - but they also don't amount to ""silence"" over events in Turkey.
Aside from social media, however, there's the issue of news coverage. And that's where things appear to get interesting.
Because despite the levels of chatter on social media, English-language Google searches of news articles indicate that coverage of the Brussels attacks far outstripped that of the bombs in Turkey. By BBC Trending's rough calculation, the term ""Istanbul attack"" was used fewer than 100,000 times in the past month in articles indexed by Google News, while the term ""Brussels attack"" returned nearly 14 million uses. Even comparing an atrocity with a roughly similar similar death toll - the Ankara bombing on 13 March - the phrase ""Ankara attack"" returns around 2 million web pages.
Join the conversation on this and other stories here.
Searching news articles in this way is an imperfect science. But it seems to indicate that English-language news editors, presumably mostly sitting in Europe and North America, decided on the whole that the Brussels attacks were of greater interest to readers and viewers than the bombings in Turkey.
There is been no shortage of commentary about how social media is transforming the world of news - and much of it is true. Facebook and Twitter have reshaped the business and the way people watch and read news. Social networks have highlighted stories that might have gone unnoticed, have made journalists more responsive and have opened up new sources and avenues for investigation.
But news organisations are still shaped by editors and the choices they make about which big stories to run with on a day-to-day basis. And those decisions, it seems, do not entirely align with what's popular on social networks.

242,31,DoS attack,Massachusetts shark attack victim 'died doing what he loved',17 September 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45552839,"A 26-year-old man who was killed in a shark attack in Massachusetts has been identified as an engineering student with plans to marry his girlfriend.
Arthur Medici became the first person to die in a shark attack in the state since 1936 on Saturday.
Isaac Rocha, the brother of Medici's girlfriend, said the victim had been teaching him to boogie-board, or body surf, when the attack happened.
""He was screaming and then I saw, like, a shark tail,"" Mr Rocha told CBS News.
""And I swam to him as fast as I could in that moment. I dragged him back to the shore and I got a boogie-board strap and I kind of tied it around his thigh to try to stop the bleeding.""
He added that Medici was not moving after he was brought to shore.
Emergency responders performed CPR, but he later died in hospital from his injuries, police in the town of Wellfleet said.
No life guards were on duty, since they are not posted after the US Labor Day holiday on 3 September.
A GoFundMe campaign to raise money to fly Medici's body from Cape Cod to his native Brazil, has raised more than $27,000 (Â£20,000) as of Monday morning.
""We love him so much, he meant the word to us,""  said Mr Rocha. ""He still means the world to us.""
The victim's aunt told the Boston Herald that he died doing what he loved.
""Oh my gosh, that's where he wanted to be every day. Every day,"" Marisa Medici told the newspaper outside her home in Revere, Massachusetts.
She said that she had begged him to stay away due to her own fear of sharks.
""He'd say, 'Aunt, they're not going to bite me. The sharks don't bite me. I'm Superman!' He was always making jokes about himself. And when it happened, I couldn't believe it was him, that it happened to us. There's no words. No words,"" she told the paper.
Ms Medici said that her nephew was bitten in both legs from behind, severing his femoral arteries and causing him to quickly bleed to death.
She said that he was engaged to a medical student, and had been working at a restaurant to support himself as he studied engineering at the Bunker Hill Community College.
She added that though a wedding date had not yet been set, he had ""bought the ring"" and the couple was already planning the wedding shower.
""He was very handsome outside, inside, joyful. The house was always full of his laughter,"" his aunt said. ""He never complained. Never complained. He was amazing.""
Officials have closed beaches in Cape Cod since the attack, and warn that the chance of shark attack has increased this year with rising seal populations, which are sharks' preferred prey.",Yes

Yusuf Aka, 22, was jailed on Friday for stabbing a man outside Leicester Royal Infirmary in January before entering and wreaking havoc.
Caroline Clayton-Barker, 36, can be seen on CCTV helping patients and even approaching Aka.
The mother-of-two said it was ""like a horror film"".
""As soon as I realised he was going to cause havoc I just said, 'right everybody out',"" she said.
""I don't feel brave, it's just your job, it's your duty of care to protect your patients.""
Leicester Crown Court heard Aka, of Grovebury Walk, Leicester, stabbed a man in the back outside the emergency department just after 02:00 GMT on January 16.
After briefly chasing them, he went into the hospital still holding the knife and lifted screens off desks and threw them around.
Aka admitted causing grievous bodily harm, wounding, affray and possession of an offensive weapon and was jailed for five years with an extended five years on licence on release.
""It was like a horror film, glistening in the light, the blade in the street lights,"" Ms Clayton-Barker said.
""It's very scary to watch back.""
The CCTV has been watched more than 700,000 times on social media.
Marianne Cain wrote: ""That nurse deserves a medal.""
Alexis Taylor commented: ""Very brave lady. She needs to be recognised for that.""
After the CCTV footage ends, Aka was restrained by a security guard and another nurse, Ms Clayton-Barker said.
Det Con Chris Symmonds said: ""The actions of members of staff who quickly took control of the situation, and led people out of his way without a thought for their own safety, was commendable, and they should be proud of what they accomplished.""
However Ms Clayton-Barker, who is no longer a nurse, said: ""It's just my job, another day at work, but it's nice to be acknowledged.""",Yes

Fourteen people, including two children, were killed when a vehicle drove through crowds in Barcelona's busy Las Ramblas district on Thursday. The area's popularity with tourists means the victims came from many different countries.
Soon afterwards a Spanish man was found stabbed to death inside a car thought to have been hijacked by the Ramblas van attacker.
Hours later a woman was killed by the attackers who ploughed a car into tourists in the resort town of Cambrils, further down the coast.
More than 100 other people from 34 different countries were injured in the attacks and, as of 27 August, 24 people were still receiving treatment in hospital, five of them in a critical condition.
Argentina's foreign ministry said two of its citizens had died:
A woman from Belgium was among the first to be confirmed dead. Elke Vanbockrijck, 44, was a postal worker from the town of Tongeren who was on holiday with her husband and two sons.
One Canadian was killed, named as Ian Moore Wilson. His wife Valerie was also injured, according to their daughter, Vancouver Police Staff Sergeant Fiona Wilson. She described her father as ""always game for a lively debate, a good book, exploring new places, and a proper-sized pint"".
A German woman, 51, died in hospital on 27 August
Two Italians were killed, in addition to dual Argentine citizen Carmen Lopardo:
""Italy will remember Bruno Gulotta and Luca Russo and expresses its solidarity with their families,"" the prime minister said in a tweet (in Italian). ""Freedom will triumph over barbarism and terrorism.""
Portugal has confirmed the deaths of two citizens. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said a 74-year-old woman from Lisbon died during the attack, and Portuguese media say her 20-year-old granddaughter, a resident of London, had also died.

United States citizen Jared Tucker, a 43-year-old on honeymoon with his wife, Heidi, was also killed. Mr Tucker leaves behind three teenage daughters.
Seven-year-old Julian Alessandro Cadman, an Australian with dual British citizenship, was confirmed killed several days after the attack took place. He was initially reported missing after he was separated from his mother, who was seriously injured in the attack.

246,35,DoS attack,Dark net experts trade theories on 'de-cloaking' after raids,10 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29987373,"The hidden web community has started trying to find out how services and identities were compromised after police raids led to 17 arrests.
Last week, several high-profile sites on the so-called ""hidden"", ""dark"" or ""deep"" web were seized.
Experts are looking at techniques the authorities may have used to ""de-cloak"" people running services accessed through anonymisation service Tor.
""We were as surprised as most of you,"" said the group that develops Tor.
In a blog post, the Tor Project team wrote: ""We are left asking, 'How did they locate the hidden services?' We don't know.
""In liberal democracies, we should expect that when the time comes to prosecute some of the 17 people who have been arrested, the police would have to explain to the judge how the suspects came to be suspects.
""As a side benefit of the operation of justice, Tor could learn if there are security flaws in hidden services or other critical internet-facing services.""
The anonymity Tor offers means that it has become popular with criminals as a way to conduct their activities online.
But the Tor Project, which receives funding from the US government, is also seen as a key component for those who need anonymity on the internet for other important reasons, such as activism in repressive regimes.
Tor is one of several services that allows people to access what is generally referred to as the ""hidden"", ""deep"" or ""dark"" web.
Here, sites that do not show up on traditional search engines are located.
But more importantly, users on Tor have their locations, and therefore identities, hidden. This is achieved by routing a person's journey on the internet through various different computers in locations all over the world, creating anonymity.
However, with this latest raid, the anonymity of users on Tor is again under question. But one expert, Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London, told the BBC it was unlikely that Tor itself had been ""cracked"".
""Some major hidden markets are still available,"" he noted. ""Including some of the biggest.
""If they had a successful way of compromising hidden services they would have done it to everyone.""
The shutdown of the hidden web services was co-ordinated by Europol in what it dubbed Operation Onymous.
In a press release, it said more than 400 services were shut - although it later clarified that to mean 400 pages were disabled. Those pages had belonged to 27 individual services that were seized and closed.
The majority of the sites were selling drugs or other illegal paraphernalia, while others dealt with the selling of stolen credit card data.
The most high-profile closure was of Silk Road 2.0 - a site selling drugs, set up after the closure of the original Silk Road site last year.
The Tor Project went into detail listing possible methods of how the sites were compromised and their owners arrested.
They included:
In an attempt to find clues as to the authorities' tactics, one owner of a seized site - who was apparently not arrested - released log files showing activity on his ""onion"", the term given to sites on Tor.
He offered the logs up to the community for scrutiny.
On a mailing list for Tor developers, he wrote: ""This will probably be a very humbling experience, because unlike my fellow illegal onion operators both past and present, I will actually be outside of a jail cell and able to read the ruthless dissection of my set-up.
""On the bright side, you're all are getting way more info from me than the pigs [police] will ever willingly cough up, which means if they have some sort of magic onion de-cloak trick, this mailing list discussion is a good chance at finding it.""
His post, titled, ""yes hello, internet super-villain here"", shared details of Doxbin, a hidden website that allowed people to upload documents supposedly anonymously.
From the logs, some have suggested that the DoS attack, as detailed above, was responsible for ""de-anonymising"" users of the site.
Dr Murdoch noted that getting a real explanation for how Operation Onymous was carried out is unlikely.
""They're not going to tell anyone about it because they want to do it again,"" he said.
""They want people to be afraid to run illegal hidden services.""

Tor is a special way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor Browser bundle, to use it.
The name is an acronym for The Onion Router - just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network.
It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department.
It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points.
Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity.
To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit relay"" - rather than the person responsible.
As well as allowing users to visit normal websites anonymously, it can also be used as part of a process to host hidden sites, which use the .onion suffix.
Tor's users include the military, law enforcement officers and journalists - who use it as a way of communicating with whistle-blowers - as well as members of the public who wish to keep their browser activity secret.
But it has also been associated with illegal activity, allowing people to visit sites offering illegal drugs for sale and access to child abuse images, which do not show up in normal search engine results and would not be available to those who did not know where to look.",Yes
247,36,DoS attack,Tesco Bank attack: What do we know?,7 November 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37896273,"Supermarket giant Tesco has suspended some parts of its online banking system after it detected attempts to steal cash from customers' accounts.
It said it spotted ""suspicious transactions"" on 40,000 accounts over the weekend, with money reportedly taken from about half of them.
Tesco has declined to elaborate on what happened, or say how much cash went astray, but said it was working with the National Crime Agency to investigate and find the culprits.
Yes, because this seems to be the first time that a UK bank has reacted so publicly by stopping some types of transactions on a web banking system because of ""online criminal activity"".
Banks are targeted all the time but typically those attacks just hit a few individuals, so do not bring about a site closure. In this case, as far as we can tell, a lot of people lost cash very quickly.
Security expert Troy Hunt said the incident was unprecedented in its scale. He added that the shutdown was ""embarrassing"" for Tesco and indicated how serious it was.
Tesco did not use the ""H"" word in its statement and in interviews its chief executive and other people speaking on behalf of the company have been careful in their choice of language.
It has said that the attack was ""sophisticated"" and that an initial investigation had revealed exactly what had happened.
So far, it has not shared that information but Tesco's actions in the wake of the weekend's events do help to narrow down the possibilities.
By letting customers withdraw cash from ATMs, use cards in shops and pay bills, it suggests that whatever went wrong does not involve the core computer systems underpinning Tesco bank. These systems used to be run by RBS but since 2008 Tesco has operated independently.
Security expert James Maude, from software company Avecto, said Tesco's decision to suspend online transactions combined with the information that so many people were hit at once clearly suggests problems with its website.
All too often, he said, maintenance or website updates can introduce errors and bugs that were not present before. Cyber-thieves are constantly scanning valuable websites to spot changes and will swoop if one emerges.
It might also be the case that a third party connected to Tesco had a security issue and attackers got in via that route, which has happened in some of the biggest attacks in recent memory.
Most cybersecurity experts have a very jaundiced view of the world that they often sum up by saying: ""Everything is broken and there is always a way in.""
In short, there is no way that any organisation can keep it, and its customers and their data, safe all the time. Many organisations now assume they will be breached and set up monitoring systems to spot when that happens, while also training staff to react quickly to fix problems.
Nik Whitfield, from security firm Panaseer, said often firms were caught out by vulnerabilities that emerge in software they use rather than through a change they make. It can be hard for organisations to keep across these factors because they use so many software packages.
In addition, some of the bugs are found by malicious hackers who sell them to gangs that want to use them. In these cases, the first an organisation will know about a bug is when it is used against them.
Tesco has had problems with some other web-based systems in the past. In 2014, thousands of Tesco customers' net accounts were deactivated after login names and passwords were shared online.
In that case, Tesco said attackers had compiled the data by using details stolen from other sites, because some Tesco customers reused passwords.
Like many other banks, Tesco has automatic fraud-spotting systems that keep an eye on accounts and build up a picture of normal activity.
It is these kind of systems that can catch you out if you suddenly use your credit or debit card to buy lots of things from lots of different places in just a few minutes.
It is these monitoring systems that are believed to have alerted Tesco to the problems that led to it suspending the site and halting transactions.
We still do not know the details of what happened so it is difficult to give concrete advice. However, it is worth taking a few simple steps to protect your online account.
First, choose a good password and do not reuse one that you use elsewhere. Use the bank's two-factor authentication and keep an eye on the transactions carried out via your account.
Keep security software on your PC, phone or tablet up-to-date and be on the lookout for phishing emails that capitalise on news about any breach.
James Chappell, chief technology officer at computer security service Digital Shadows, said it was already starting to see cyber-gangs it monitors sending out spam posing as updates from Tesco security staff. The gangs are hoping to trick people into handing over their Tesco account details to let thieves take advantage.",Yes
248,37,DoS attack,NI assembly to be recalled over loyalist violence,6 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-56649459,"The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled early from its Easter break on Thursday to discuss the violence in some loyalist areas.
A petition tabled by the Alliance Party to bring MLAs back to the chamber has secured the 30 signatures required.
Forty-one police officers have been injured as a result of the violence in parts of greater Belfast and Londonderry, with ten arrests made to date.
Detectives are also investigating parades in Portadown and Markethill on Monday.
Politicians are united in calling for the violence to end, but are divided over why it has erupted.
First Minister Arlene Foster urged young people not to get a criminal record by getting involved in violence.
""I say to young people who are angry, do not get yourself a criminal record. It will blight your life for the rest of your life, you won't be able to go on holiday, so please, please desist from this violence.
""There is a better way, and the way is through politics,"" Mrs Foster said.
Asked about claims that political unionist rhetoric has inflamed tensions, Mrs Foster said it was as if ""young people do not have the ability to think for themselves"".
""Seriously, do we not think that people have a brain to think for themselves? They do of course.""
She added: ""You're hurting your own neighbourhoods, you're hurting your own communities and therefore you need to step back.""
But Mrs Foster also said confidence had gone in the senior management of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) over the decision by prosecutors not to charge anyone over the Bobby Storey funeral.  She said she had not been in contact with Chief Constable Simon Byrne.
Mrs Foster said she had spoken to the chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland to offer her support to rank-and-file officers.
""The chief constable needs to resign, and needs to resign quickly. Confidence is gone in his leadership, and confidence is gone in his senior management team.""
Mrs Foster also said she has asked the executive to urgently look at the reopening of youth centres to divert young people away from ""malign influences"".
North Belfast MLA Gerry Kelly said the political rhetoric from the DUP predates the Bobby Storey funeral decision.
""Political figures in unionism are winding young people up, and destroying their lives,"" Mr Kelly said.
""Let me condemn the attacks on the police. Unionism, the wrong leadership, are inflaming the situation instead of calming it down.""
Justice Minister Naomi Long said you cannot ""divorce"" recent criticism of the police and the attacks on officers which has followed.She said some remarks around policing has been ""reckless"" and the PSNI has been made a ""lightning conductor for people's anger"".
Ms Long said she was ""appalled at the violence that has been demonstrated towards police officers"".
""They should be supported by all of us for doing their job, not attacked because of it.
""The scenes we have witnessed over the past few nights have resulted in nothing but property destroyed and lives endangered. Once again we see adults drawing children and young people into violence and disorder.""
The assembly will sit on Thursday at 11:00 BST, following a successful recall petition tabled by the Alliance Party.
On a visit to the Nelson Drive area of Londonderry, party leader Colum Eastwood said people are ""living in fear"" because of the actions of a minority.
""The violence across the city and across the north needs to stop. If people have issues they can talk about them. People living in their own communities are being tortured.""
Upper Bann MLA and Policing Board member Dolores Kelly said the assembly recall would give political leaders the opportunity to condemn the violence and confirm their support for law and order.
""Words have consequences,"" she said. ""The violence must stop and people need to realise that violence will not pay.""
Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie said there needed to be ""strong, sensible leadership"" from the chief constable.
""We don't believe that we've got that,"" he said.
""We absolutely support our police service and they have been caught in the crossfire again of political failure.
""I hold my own hand up when I say that political failure has led us to where we are now. We are in extremely difficult times.""
Leader Jim Allister said there is a perception among some in loyalist communities, difficult to counter, that violence pays.
""They saw it work so well for those who govern,"" he said.
""Violence is not justified, was never justified, but the most difficult message I have to sell to young people in the loyalist community is to deal with the reality that violence paid for Sinn FÃ©in/IRA. It worked.""
Leader Billy Hutchinson said he has seen ""no evidence"" that the violence is organised. He said he did not take to the streets to discourage those involved as ""once a riot starts, you've no chance in controlling it"".""There is no point in trying to go onto the streets, people won't listen to you.""Mr Hutchinson said: ""I do not want this young generation thinking they should go out there and commit violence to try to correct the mistakes that was made by other generations.""We need to find political solutions for political problems.""
Conservative MP Simon Hoare urged those involved in the violence to ""stop it now"".He said it was ""the behaviour of thuggish anarchists"".""This is a very dangerous path backwards, and we all know a small fire can very easily get out of control,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle.""People may be angry, they are angry, of course we know this, people are frustrated. ""We have had the Covid restrictions, there are economic concerns, there are job concerns, there are investment concerns, concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol, concerns about policing etc, but this is not the way to do it.""",Yes
249,38,DoS attack,Snowden leaks: GCHQ 'attacked Anonymous' hackers,5 February 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26049448,"GCHQ disrupted ""hacktivist"" communications by using one of their own techniques against them, according to the latest Edward Snowden leaks.
Documents from the whistle-blower published by NBC indicate UK cyberspies used a denial of service attack (DoS) in 2011 to force a chatroom used by the Anonymous collective offline.
A spokeswoman for GCHQ said all the agency's activities were authorised and subject to rigorous oversight.
But others say it raises concerns.
Dr Steven Murdoch, a security researcher at the University of Cambridge, said using a DoS attack to overwhelm a computer server with traffic would have risked disrupting other services.
""It's quite possible that the server was used for other purposes which would have been entirely unrelated to Anonymous,"" he said.
""It's also likely that most of the chat that was going on about Anonymous was not to do with hacking because the people who join Anonymous are fairly wide-ranging in what they think it is legitimate to do.
""Some have gone into criminality but many others just go out and organise protests, letter-writing campaigns and other things that are not criminal.""
Campaign group Privacy International is also worried.
""There is no legislation that clearly authorises GCHQ to conduct cyber-attacks,"" said head of research Eric King.
""So, in the absence of any democratic mechanisms, it appears GCHQ has granted itself the power to carry out the very same offensive attacks politicians have criticised other states for conducting.""
The UK government's Cyber Security Strategy document, published in 2011, says officials should take ""proactive measures to disrupt threats to our information security"", but also notes that any such action should be consistent with freedom of expression and privacy rights.
The latest documents are published alongside an article part-written by Glenn Greenwald.
The journalist is one of only two people reported to have access to all whistle-blower Edward Snowden's leaked documents.
The article highlights that the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is the division identified as being responsible for the DoS attack  - a unit whose existence had not previously been publicly disclosed.
The documents indicate the unit also spied on and communicated with chatroom users to identify hackers who had stolen information.
In one case, agents are said to have tricked a hacker nicknamed P0ke who claimed to have stolen data from the US government. They did this by sending him a link to a BBC article entitled: ""Who loves the hacktivists?""
""Sexy,"" P0ke is alleged to have commented.
But when he clicked the link it is reported that JTRIG was able to bypass measures he had taken to hide his identity, although it is not clear how.
NBC reports that P0ke - a Scandinavian college student - was never arrested despite GCHQ learning his true name.
But the leaks indicate others were imprisoned as a result of JTRIG operations.
One paper highlights the case of Edward Pearson - a hacker known as GZero - who was sentenced to two years in jail in 2012 for illegally acquiring credit and debit card details registered with PayPal.
A transcript of a chatroom conversation indicates that Pearson had contacted GCHQ agents claiming he knew a hacktivist they were investigating, unaware of the agents' true identity.
In addition to Anonymous, the documents list LulzSec, the A-Team and the Syrian Cyber Army as hacktivist groups GCHQ was concerned about.
In one case it appears simply warning activists that carrying out their own DoS attacks was illegal had the desired effect.
NBC reports that the notice was posted via Facebook, Twitter, email, instant messenger and Skype.
One alleged GCHQ document states that one month later 80% of those contacted had stopped using a hacktivist chatroom.
But the documents also indicate that GCHQ was willing to use DoS attacks itself as part of an operation codenamed Rolling Thunder, which prevented hacktivists using a chatroom for 30 hours in September 2011.
GCHQ has a longstanding policy of not commenting on specific intelligence-gathering procedures, but a spokeswoman said all its work was ""carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework"".
Even so, one cybersecurity expert said he had mixed feelings about the latest leaks.
""We have to remember that cyberspooks within GCHQ are equally, if not more, skilled than many black-hat hackers, and the tools and techniques they are going to use to fight cybercrime are surely going to be similar to that of the bad guys,"" said Andrew Miller, chief operating officer at Corero Network.
""Legally, we enter a very grey area here; where members of Lulzsec were arrested and incarcerated for carrying out DoS attacks, but it seems that JTRIG are taking the same approach with impunity.""",Yes
250,39,DoS attack,Top tips on how to avoid a shark attack and what to do if you are attacked,20 July 2015,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-33591730,"A professional Australian surfer has been attacked by a shark on live TV during an event in South Africa.
Mick Fanning was competing in a World Surf League competition when the shark came at him from behind.
He punched the creature and escaped on a rescue craft.
Unprovoked shark attacks on humans are rare with an average of around 75 per year, resulting in about 10 deaths.  You have a greater chance of dying from a bee sting or being hit by lightning.
But with their amazing sense of smell, taste, hearing and sight, what can you do to avoid a shark attack? And what can you do if you are attacked?
This is when sharks are most active.
Also avoid swimming during or after storms, which can make the water cloudy and churn up the fish that sharks feed on.
They won't be able to tell if you're human or prey.
The same applies to river mouths -  where the water can be muddy.
People on their own are more likely to be attacked than large groups.
Don't wander too far from the shoreline.
The further you are from the shore, the further you are from help.
Avoid wearing shiny jewellery, because the reflected light resembles the shimmer of fish scales.
Also don't wear brightly-coloured or patterned clothing, because sharks see contrast particularly well.
Special striped wetsuits which look like poisonous, black and white banded sea snakes are being tested which warn a shark that a diver or surfer isn't safe to eat.
Sharks can sense the smells emitted from bait at incredible distances, so steer clear of areas where fishermen are using rods and the routes which fishing boats use.
It's fairly obvious that you shouldn't feed sharks.
Stay out of water with sewage being pumped into it and don't enter the water if you are bleeding. They both attract sharks.
If other marine mammals such as seals are around, the chances are that sharks will be too.
Also be on the lookout for signs of bait fishes or feeding activity - diving seabirds are good indicators. Animals that eat the same food items are often found nearby.
Remember, a predator is never too far from its prey.
Try not to splash around while in the water, and don't allow pets in the water because of their splashing movements.
You don't want to make the same movements as a shark's favourite meal makes.
It's probably not a great idea to swim between sandbars or near steep drop-offs in the ocean, because those are the favourite places for sharks to congregate.
Don't enter the water if sharks are known to be present, and get out of the sea if sharks are seen while there. And, of course, don't harass a shark if you see one.
If you do see a shark stay where you are as quietly as possible. Most sharks are just curious and will leave on their own.
If you can, stay relaxed. Attacks are very rare.
If you are targeted by a shark, the general rule is, do whatever it takes to get away - but do it calmly.
But try to fight back and startle it.
The best place to hit is its nose.
Also try to claw at its eyes and grab its gills, two of the most sensitive areas on a shark.
Never take your eyes off the shark, because they have several methods of attack including hit-and-run and bump-and-bite.
Make sure you're able to defend your front and sides and use a weapon like a surf board if possible, don't use your hands.
If you are bitten, stop the bleeding and get help as soon as possible.
The tips were put together by George H. Burgess, senior biologist in Ichthyology at the Florida Museum of Natural History.

251,40,DoS attack,Do Republican attacks on Obama strike a chord?,10 January 2012,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16480732,"Waterville Valley, New Hampshire: Skiers in bright clothes snake down the mountain side in the brilliant sunshine of the White Mountains.
But puffs of fine fog further up the slope are a tell-tale sign of an unseasonable annoyance. No snow.
The mist from half a dozen blowers is man-made snow. The skiing is fine, but the resort as a whole feels less wintry than it should. That is a worry to some in a state where tourism long ago replaced manufacturing as the main source of income.
No-one blames President Obama for the weather. The White House isn't accused of stopping snow with too many regulations. That is almost a surprise.
But the Republican candidates vying to become their party's candidate for president do blame him for most of the country's economic woes, and do so in strong language.
They suggest he's killed jobs and is taking the US on an un-American road. Front-runner Mitt Romney says in every speech that Obama is turning an enterprise culture into a European-style entitlement society.
Given that the latest figures suggest the economy is picking up, I wonder how this plays now. Particularly in New Hampshire, a state that is richer, has less poverty and lower unemployment than most in the USA.
The Waterville Valley ski resort's boss is Chris Sununu, the son of John, former White House chief of staff and New Hampshire governor.
Chris Sununu says both as a businessman and a Republican he does blame Obama for the state of the economy.
""When you have a strategy of big bloated government, a lot of regulation, and the sense that government can do better than the individual can, that's just not what America was built on, and that's not what drives a good free economy,"" he says.
I put it to him that is fine as political rhetoric, but question whether Obama's policies have really hurt his thriving ski resort.
""Without a doubt,"" Sununu said.
""In the season, I have close to 500 to 800 employees at any given time. The healthcare costs alone can be enormous on that. But if I don't know what the regulations are gonna be, if I think government is going to be too overbearing on me, then I have to hold my cash.
""I have to hold back. I can't expand. I can't be creative. I can't give my employees the benefits that they might need because I don't know what's coming down the road. It's that uncertainty that so many businesses in America are facing today, that we just gotta get out from underneath.""
Not everyone agrees that the language of the campaign reflects reality. At the house party for Republican candidate Jon Huntsman  which I mentioned yesterday, I ran into Donald Byrne.
Mr Byrne is the boss of a software company and an independent who's re-registered as a Republican so he can vote for the former ambassador to China and Utah governor.
He says the language used about Obama is pandering to the base.
""I think the Republican party in the United States has shifted very far to the right,"" he says.
""Being a moderate is a negative in this campaign and that's very unfortunate, because the majority of Americans are moderate and well balanced in their thought process.
""There is too much pandering to these right-wing extreme sides.""
It is the nature of elections that choices are put in stark, easy-to-understand terms. I have no doubt that in 2012 two very different visions of America will be on offer.
But does a polarised politics force cruder choices than might be good for a country's economic health?
I meet Bob Bastani, a senior New Hampshire Republican and economist, in his home over-looking New Hampshire's beautiful coastal basin near Newmarket.
He worked in the treasury team under the first President Bush, most recently headed a bank in the Philippines and ran unsuccessfully for Congress.
He told me that while politics still was a battle between the economics of Milton Friedman and John Maynard Keynes , in reality, neither theory can cope with the current crisis.
""That battle between those two views has been the central debate in economics for almost 100 years now, but they have converged somewhere in the middle,"" Mr Bastani said.
""If you look at Keynesian economics, they have moved much more towards an acceptance of monetary policy.
""That's part of the problem: the two have sort of met in the middle, and are stuck there with no real policy prescriptions. So there is no real black-and-white answer much as we would like to have black-and-white answers.
""So if you have the two principal instruments of economic management no longer working, then what do you do? And that's the central conundrum.""
Still, campaigning in primary colours works well, even if you have to govern in grey. Republican voters choosing a candidate on Tuesday may be looking for the man best able to excoriate Obama, rather than the one most suited to replace him. By the time the polls close, he may even have been blamed for the lack of snow.",Yes
252,41,DoS attack,West Belfast: Child left 'traumatised' after man is shot,10 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-55258851,"A man has been shot in both legs in what police have described as a ""merciless attack"" in west Belfast where a young child was present.
It happened at a house in Hazel Glen about 20:00 GMT on Wednesday.
Two masked men forced their way into the property and fired a number of shots at the man in the hallway.
The victim, who was left with ""significant injuries,"" is being treated in hospital.

253,42,DoS attack,Why do cows attack?,23 June 2009,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8114529.stm,"A fortnight ago a cow left David Blunkett with a black eye and cracked rib. Now a vet walking her dogs has been trampled to death by cattle. Why?





Cow attacks are rare




With its limpid eyes and slow gait, the cow is generally a placid creature. But once this gentle giant - typically weighing about 1,000lb (450kg) - has a calf to protect, it's best to steer clear. Liz Crowsley, a vet, has been trampled to death by a herd of cattle while walking the Pennine Way with her two dogs. And a fortnight ago, a cow left David Blunkett with a black eye and a cracked rib. Also on a walking holiday, the former home secretary was accompanied by his guide dog Sadie. In both cases, the cows are thought to have been trying to drive off the dogs in order to protect their young. While such attacks are rare, Health and Safety Executive figures show that 18 people - excluding Ms Crowsley - have been killed and 481 injured by cows in the past eight years. 






			                            WHO, WHAT, WHY?
			                        



A regular part of the BBC News Magazine, Who, What, Why? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines




Spring and early summer are when cows feel most vulnerable to interlopers, but they can be spooked into reacting at any time of year, says Sharon Woods of the Ramblers' Association. ""We hear of one or two incidents each week, but these don't usually involve serious injuries."" Farmers and vets on call-outs are also at risk. Keep calm, carry onIf you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle, move away as carefully and quietly as possible, she says. ""Keep dogs close and on a leash - and if the cows charge, let go the leash. The dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you."" 





Sadie escaped unscathed




Because generally it is this four-legged threat the cows are trying to see off. But the dog's owner may be caught up in the attack if the dog cannot run away and instead tries to hide behind its human. While Mr Blunkett let go of Sadie and she shot off, he stumbled to the ground and the cow fell over too. ""She hit my side and broke my rib. Had her full weight of around a tonne hit me, I'd have been a gonner."" Those without canine companions should follow similar advice: move away calmly, do not panic and make no sudden noises. Chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat. The National Farmers' Union also recommends that walkers avoid crossing fields. ""Cows are quite docile animals, but can get nervous,"" says Ms Woods. And at five feet tall and weighing at least 1,000 pounds (450kg), it wouldn't do to make a cow too nervous.

254,43,DoS attack,London Bridge attack: What powers do the police have?,4 June 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40152190,"Following the London terror attack, which left seven people dead and 48 injured, Theresa May has said the UK must adapt to a ""new trend"" in terrorism.
There were 255 terrorism-related arrests in the year ending 31 March 2016, according to the latest statistics from the Home Office. The arrests led to 37 prosecutions.
In 2015, 128 terrorist and extremist prisoners were released from custody, the Home Office says.
Reality Check has been looking into the main powers the police and security services have to stop suspected terrorists.
Under Section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 the police can stop and search a suspect if they have reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities.
It's difficult to know how many stop and searches are carried out under this power as most police forces don't separate Section 43 from other types of stop and search.
One force that does hold the data is the Met police. They say that 541 people were searched under the Terrorism Act in the 12 months to March 2016 - a rise of 32% on the previous year.
The police also have the power to search suspects even if they don't have suspicion of any links to terrorist activities.
In May 2012 the rules were tightened: the police can only carry out searches in designated places where they have reasonable grounds to believe an act of terrorism will take place.
At present anyone arrested under the Terrorism Act can be held without charge for up to 14 days.
In 2006 the law was changed in order to double the maximum period to 28 days. Only six suspects were ever held for that length.
In 2011 it reverted back to 14 days. This was during the coalition government when it was decided not to proceed with the annual vote in Parliament to keep it at 28 days. Theresa May was home secretary at the time.
In the year to March 2016, 46 people were detained under the powers - 25 of whom were charged. The longest anyone was held for was 13 days, which happened on three occasions during that year.
The police can arrest individuals who they suspect of planning an attack. Section 5 of the 2006 Terrorism Act made it a specific offence to prepare (or help others prepare) for an act of terrorism.
The maximum sentence for this offence is imprisonment for life. According to the CPS, 25 people were convicted under Section 5 in the year ending September 2016, up from 11 in the previous 12 months.
There is no specific offence for carrying out a terrorist act. If a perpetrator was arrested after committing an attack they would be charged with offences such as murder or grievous bodily harm.
It is also an offence for someone not to tell the police about someone they believe is involved in planning a terrorism act. A conviction for this offence can lead to a five year maximum sentence.
Organisations can be banned by the home secretary if they are believed to be participating, promoting or encouraging terrorism.
Being a member - or claiming to be a member - of a banned organisation can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison and or a fine.
The Home Office says 71 international terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.
A small number of agencies are able to carry out surveillance inside residential premises or private vehicles. The power requires authorisation by the secretary of state. The Office of Surveillance Commissioners provides independent oversight.
The security services also have the power to intercept communication data. The power is available to nine agencies, including GCHQ and MI5.
The Investigatory Powers Act, passed in 2016, compels internet companies to keep records of every website and messaging service UK-based citizens visit for a year.
Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures, or TPims, are a form of house arrest. It applies to people who are deemed a threat but cannot be prosecuted or deported if they are a foreign national. They were first introduced in 2012 and replaced controversial control orders.
Those under TPims can be subjected to electronic tagging, having to report regularly to the police and surrendering travel documents. A suspect must live at home and stay there overnight - possibly for up to 10 hours.
The suspect is allowed to use a mobile phone and the internet to work and study, subject to conditions.
In 2015, TPims were toughened by granting the ability to relocate subjects up to 200 miles away from their normal residence.
TPims initially last for one year, although they can be extended to two. It is possible for them to remain beyond the two-year maximum if there is suspicion of further terrorism activity. A breach of the TPims can lead to imprisonment.
As of November 2016, seven people were subjected to TPims - six of whom were British citizens.
Temporary Exclusion Orders (TEOs) were created by the 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act. They apply to British citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activity abroad. They are designed to stop suspects from re-entering the UK unless they give themselves up at the border.
Those subjected to TEOs are only allowed to return if they make contact with the UK authorities. If they do come back, they are likely to face either prosecution or close supervision under monitoring powers.
The Orders last for up to two years at a time and can be renewed. Breaches could lead to a prison sentence.
The home secretary applies the TEO where they ""reasonably suspect that the subject is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity while outside the UK"".
The government released details on its disruptive and investigatory powers in February.
In the wake of the Manchester bombing, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed they had been used once so far.
Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives the police the power to stop, search and hold individuals at ports, airports and international railway stations.
Initially individuals could be questioned for up to nine hours - although a change in the guidelines means it is now up to six hours. The police also have the power to inspect electronic devices such as phones and laptops.
The police do not need prior knowledge or suspicion to use Schedule 7 - although the Home Office says it's done after ""informed considerations"".
A total of 23,717 people were stopped under the power in the year ending June 2016, a fall of 23% on the previous year.
Despite fewer people being stopped, the number detained under the power has increased by 7%, rising from 1,649 to 1,760 in the same period.

255,44,DoS attack,Brown Clee Hill: Killer 'roamed around' looking for targets,25 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-56202291,"A man ""roamed around"" looking for people he could kill before fatally stabbing a 70-year-old hill walker, a court has heard.
Richard Hall suffered 26 injuries, including a ""horrific"" wound to his hand when he was attacked on Brown Clee Hill in Shropshire last August.
Moses Christensen, 22, told police he planned to kill and searched for victims, Stafford Crown Court heard.
Mr Christensen denies murder by reason of diminished responsibility.
He was found, soaking wet, by officers outside the home of a woman who had called police.
On Thursday, extracts of his interviews with police after his arrest were read out in court.
He told officers his intention was to ""go out and kill or be killed"" adding that he looked for ""small groups who I thought I could overpower"".
""I had planned to kill people,"" he said.
""It was sort of a gradual, long process for me. It was planned, it was calculated to a large extent. I think that's a very important point.""
He had considered attacking an elderly couple and when asked by an officer why he did not carry it out, Mr Christensen, of Corser Street, Stourbridge, West Midlands, said he ""didn't feel comfortable"".
""I could see people on the hillside in the distance so I planned for further targets. That is what I was doing,"" he said.
But the attack on Mr Hall, from Perton in South Staffordshire, happened when foggy conditions provided a ""good opportunity"", with many of Mr Christensen's ""criteria"" in place, jurors heard.
Dr Brett Lockyer, a Home Office-approved pathologist, told the court Mr Hall suffered wounds to his neck and chest, as well as one penetrating his skull.
He would have died in ""seconds to minutes"" due to the severity of his injuries, Dr Lockyer said.
Jurors must decide if the killing was murder or manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The trial continues.

256,45,DoS attack,'Sinister elements' getting younger people to attack PSNI,5 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-56634052,"There have been violent incidents in County Antrim for a third night in a row, with young people involved in disturbances in Carrickfergus on Monday night.
Five PSNI officers were injured during disorder in County Antrim on Sunday.
Police Federation chair Mark Lindsay said ""older more sinister elements"" were influencing younger people to attack police officers.
Petrol bombs were thrown at police in Carrickfergus on Sunday.
Officers were also attacked in Newtownabbey on the same night.
In Londonderry, police were targeted in the Dungiven Road area on Sunday with children as young as 12 involved.
There were reports that police were attacked at the scene of a bomb alert at the Templemore Road, in a predominantly nationalist part of Derry, on Monday night.
Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster, Mr Lindsay said there is ""obviously paramilitary involvement"" in the recent attacks.
""Some [young people] don't even know why they are attacking them, they're simply doing as they're told or it's seen by some as a bit of fun or recreational.""
Ch Supt Davy Beck described the violence as ""senseless"" and ""reckless"".
""To those in our community with influence, I would urge you to use that influence so we do not see any further disgraceful scenes of violence on our streets so we can ensure young people do not get caught up in criminality and that they are kept safe and away from harm,"" he said
Ch Supt Beck said there had been an element of ""organisation"" to the attacks.
""I believe there is a small group of disaffected criminal elements involved in influencing young people,"" he said.
He urged young people involved to ""think about your future and employment prospects and not get sucked in"".
He added that police had been ""successful in respect of criminal gangs"" in the area and the trouble was a ""perhaps a reaction from those involved in criminality"".
The disorder in Newtownabbey started at about 21:00 BST on Sunday at the Cloughfern roundabout.
Between 20 to 30 people in masks set bins on fire. When officers moved in to the area, four petrol bombs were thrown at them leaving one officer with a leg injury.
About an hour later, on North Road in Carrickfergus, a crowd of up to 50 people gathered and 20 petrol bombs were thrown at police.
Four officers were injured after they were struck by masonry and sustained leg, foot and neck injuries.
Last week, it emerged that prosecutors would not charge anyone in relation to their attendance at the funeral of republican Bobby Storey.
The funeral attracted 2,000 mourners when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians who attended were examined, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.
It led to unionist politicians calling on Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign.
DUP MLA Christopher Stalford said ""cool heads must prevail"" and there will be ""far reaching effects on the lives of those who are arrested and convicted"".
He said if people are ""angry or frustrated"" over issues surrounding the funeral, or the NI Protocol, an element of the Brexit deal which has caused disruption at Northern Ireland's ports, they should ""get politically active"" and not riot.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA and policing board member Gerry Kelly accused unionist leadership, ""in particular the DUP"", of using rhetoric that has caused the violence.
""There is a responsibility in the unionist leadership, political leadership, to show leadership here and not be winding the situation up,"" he told the programme.
""First of all over the hard Brexit that they created and then they're trying to blame everything on the decision that was made recently.
""This calling for everybody in high office who they disagree with to resign and demanding their resignation also winds the situation up as well.""
Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie has said ""everyone bears responsibility"" for the violence that has erupted across Northern Ireland.
""Any politician whether they are a nationalist or a unionist to say that it has got nothing to do with them is pretty disgraceful,"" Mr Beattie said.
He added: ""For anybody to sit there and not take blame are in absolute denial.""
SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood described the trouble as ""deeply frustrating"".
He said: ""Unionist leaders need to take some responsibility for the incendiary rhetoric they have been using over many weeks.
""They need to show some leadership before the consequences become even more severe.""
Alliance Party MLA John Blair said it was ""never acceptable or justifiable to direct that anger at police"".
Thirty-two police officers have been injured during violence in Belfast and Derry since Friday.
On Saturday night, there were disturbances in Newtownabbey, on the outskirts of Belfast.
It involved three vehicles being hijacked and set alight, and thirty petrol bombs being thrown at police, at Cloughfern roundabout in the O'Neill Road area.
Police described the violence as an ""orchestrated attack on police"".
A number of people have been charged over the incidents.
A statement from the Church of Ireland bishops called for the violence ""stop immediately"".
""The PSNI do an incredibly difficult job and deserve our support,"" the church leaders said.
""People may have criticisms of policing but there is a forum for this, and any criticisms should always be expressed respectfully.""",Yes

258,47,DoS attack,Bristol protest: Prime minister calls protests 'disgraceful',27 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/56548885,"A third night of protests in the city of Bristol has been called ""disgraceful"" by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The demonstration, which started off peaceful, later turned violent as protesters and police clashed, and ten people have been arrested.
The protest was organised in response to the government's plans to give police more precise powers to restrict demonstrations.
These plans are being debated by Members of Parliament this week.
Why are people angry about planned changes to protest laws?
Brand new TV show Planet Defenders coming to CBBC!
Advice if you're upset by the news
The demonstration began in College Green in Bristol during the day, before moving to Bridewell police station later in the evening.
Police in riot gear blocked access to the road and protestors sat in front of them in response.
Later in the evening, police officers said the ""atmosphere changed"" and ""people became physical"".
Footage showed police in riot gear using their shields to push protesters back.
Supt Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police said ""reasonable force had to be used"".
He said many of the marchers had followed the police warnings to go home, which he said he was grateful for, but that some who stayed in the centre had attacked officers by throwing missiles including bottles, a bicycle pedal and eggs.
The government has proposed some changes to laws on crime and justice in England and Wales as part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.
One part of the changes covers protests.
At the moment, if police say they want to limit a protest - for example to keep the public safe and prevent crime - they generally have to show it may result in ""serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"".
They can then impose specific measures, for example restricting the route of a march, and typically when it comes to major events, the police and organisers will try and work out a plan together weeks in advance.
The proposed change, would mean police chiefs will be able to put more conditions on static (non-moving) protests, including imposing a start and finish time and setting noise limits. These rules would also apply to a demonstration by just one person.
For example, under the new law, if someone held a one-person demo and refused to follow police directions over how they should protest - they could be fined up to £2,500.
Also at the moment, police need to prove protesters knew they had been told to move on, before they can be said to have broken the law, under the new proposals, it will also become a crime to fail to follow restrictions the protesters ""ought"" to have known about, even if they have not received a direct order from an officer.
The proposed law also includes an offence of ""intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance"". The aim of this is to stop people occupying public spaces and using other protest tactics to make themselves seen and heard.
Damage to memorials could also lead to up to 10 years in prison. It's after a statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down during a demo in Bristol last year.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Last night saw disgraceful attacks against police officers in Bristol. Our officers should not have to face having bricks, bottles and fireworks being thrown at them by a mob intent on violence and causing damage to property. The police and the city have my full support.""
Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said he recognised ""the frustrations"" with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but said that: ""smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through"".
Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the violence was ""completely unacceptable"" and that protesters should be using: ""other ways of expressing whatever dissatisfaction they have"".",Yes
259,48,DoS attack,Attack hits Wikileaks cable site,30 November 2010,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11875830,"A web attack has been launched against the Wikileaks site set up to host leaked US diplomatic cables.
The deluge of data launched against the site managed to briefly make it unreachable around 1200 GMT on 30 November.
So far no-one has come forward to claim responsibility for the so-called denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
A similar attack was launched against the main Wikileaks site prior to the public release of the first cables.
Wikileaks revealed that the separate cablegate website was suffering a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack via a message posted to its Twitter stream.
The cablegate site went live on Sunday night and soon after started to suffer occasional downtime.
A DDoS attack involves swamping a site with so many requests for access that it becomes overwhelmed.
Data gathered by net monitoring firm Netcraft showed that the cablegate site was intermittently available around Tuesday lunchtime and early afternoon because of the attack.
Prior to the launch of the site, Wikileaks had taken the precaution of hosting it on three separate IP addresses to cope with any attack.
""This does not appear to have prevented the current attack from succeeding,"" wrote Paul Mutton, a security analyst at Netcraft, in a blog post
He told the BBC that it was hard to work out what type of attack was under way. At the weekend before the cablegate site went live, a hacktivist known only as The Jester threatened to attack Wikileaks claiming its leak of cables would endanger US troops.
Mr Mutton said the latest attack was unlikely to be the work of The Jester as he has typically used Twitter to announce his targets. Something that was not done before the latest attack began.
""The cablegate site has only released 281 of the 251,287 leaked cables, so these attacks are likely to be symbolic action more than anything else,"" said Mr Mutton.
As cablegate came under attack, a separate ongoing assault against the main Wikileaks site made it unreachable on Tuesday afternoon.",Yes
260,49,DoS attack,Dollar singer David Van Day 'doing fine' after heart attack,1 November 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37833361,"David Van Day, a former member of pop duo Dollar, is ""doing fine"" after suffering a heart attack, his spokesman has said.
The singer was taken to a hospital in Essex over the weekend after suffering chronic chest pain for several days.
The 59-year-old was later moved to St Bartholomew's Hospital in central London for treatment.
A representative told the BBC that Van Day has ""had a stent fitted to [a] main artery"".
A stent is a short wire-mesh tube, inserted into the artery via a catheter. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow through the artery more freely.
Van Day's spokesman said the singer ""should be leaving for home soon"" following the operation but will need to rest for the next month.
The singer has cancelled his scheduled appearances for November.
He tweeted: ""Thanks for all the kind and positive messages I've had today. I'm hoping to make a speedy recovery.""
Van Day, together with Canadian-born Thereza Bazar, made up Dollar - a pop duo who had a string of chart hits in the late 1970s and 1980s, including Mirror Mirror and Give Me Back My Heart.
The singer took part in the 2008 series of ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, finishing in fourth place behind winner Joe Swash, George Takei and Martina Navratilova.

Sahayb Abu, 27, admits buying an 18-inch (46cm) sword, knife, body armour, balaclavas and a hat - but denies doing so in preparation for an attack.
He told his trial he searched for IS online for news of two half-brothers, who are believed to have died in Syria.
Mr Abu, from Dagenham, agreed with a prosecutor he had a grudge against IS.
He told John McGuinness QC he ""would not care"" if the terror group was bombed to bits.
Giving evidence, he said he was no Mother Teresa or Dalai Lama, and his ""pro-violence"" posts on social media were just ""trolling"".
He added: ""This happened during lockdown. Nothing to do. The phone became a kind of portal. Being a troll.""
Mr Abu is alleged to have discussed guns with an undercover police officer he met through an IS supporters' Telegram chat group.
During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked him about one post in which he described Islam as being a religion of ""war"", saying: ""That post could have been posted by somebody who believes in the ideas of IS, do you agree? And those are your words.
""Bearing in mind the personal tragedy that had befallen your family because of the activities of IS, why post something like that?""
In response, Mr Abu told the jury: ""Because it would bring a thrill to my life. I know it's sad. I know it's pathetic.""
But Mr McGuinness went on to tell the defendant: ""You did what your brothers did, you joined them. You became an IS supporter.""
Mr Abu replied: ""No, I did not support them at all. I wanted to do good things in my life.""
His brother Muhamed Abu, 32, of Norwood, south London, is also on trial at the Old Bailey. He denies failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism.

263,52,DoS attack,The real Moby Dick: Do whales really attack humans?,20 December 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25430996,"The revenge of a whale or an accidental tragedy? A dramatic retelling of the story that inspired Herman Melville's classic novel will be hitting our screens on BBC One this Sunday - but do whales really attack humans intentionally?
Sperm whales are relatively placid mammals and very few incidents in modern times suggest otherwise. They mainly feed on squid and rarely attack, apparently only when mistaking other mammals for seals or prey.
In his 1839 book about the natural history of sperm whales, Thomas Beale, a surgeon aboard a whaleship, described them as ""a most timid and inoffensive animal readily endeavouring to escape from the slightest thing which bears an unusual appearance"".
But Dr Richard Bevan, a zoologist and lecturer at Newcastle University, suggests that a sperm whale may remember if it was previously attacked.
""I have no doubt that an individual would remember being harpooned and might respond aggressively if it thought that it was threatened,"" he said.
""On the other hand a large vessel like a whaling boat would probably look like a very large threat, even to a full grown sperm whale, so I'd have thought it more likely to have moved away.""
But 19th century literature seems to suggest otherwise, with numerous stories of sperm whales attacking ships on purpose. But were they fuelled by threat, hunger or, as in Melville's classic novel, even revenge?
In 1820, a giant sperm whale, apparently 85 feet long (the average is 50ft) attacked a whaleship named the Essex, causing her to sink. Her crew were left adrift in three whaleboats (lighter boats used in the capture of whales) thousands of miles from land.
Alone in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the men had to decide whether to head for the nearest islands, a thousand miles downwind to the west, or set out on an epic journey of almost three thousand miles to reach the South American mainland.
Fear of cannibals forced them to choose South America, but they never made it.
Of the 21 crew members aboard The Essex, just eight members of the crew were rescued after more than 80 days at sea; with an incredible tale of starvation, dehydration and unfathomable, mortal desperation to tell.
Two members of the crew wrote accounts of the failed voyage. First mate Owen Chase's account was a widely circulated story of the time, published just months after his return home. The other, written by cabin boy Thomas Nickerson 50 years later, was not published, but, remarkably, was discovered in an attic in 1960, 80 years after Nickerson's death.
Their accounts differ in places, but what is indisputable is that they both recall exactly how their supposedly ""lucky"" ship sank. It was stove by a giant whale.
Herman Melville heard this story, met with the captain of the Essex and was inspired to write his classic novel Moby Dick.
Moby Dick was actually named after a real whale, Mocha Dick, first spotted by sailors in the 19th century near the island of Mocha, near southern Chile. Whales were often given pet names by sailors, Tom and Dick were common - though there are no accounts of a Harry.
Mocha Dick was an albino whale, described by explorer Jerimiah N Reynolds as ""an old bull whale of prodigious size and strengthâ¦ white as wool"". Legend has it that it killed 30 men and was covered in scars and punctured with spears from previous attempts to harpoon it; before eventually being slaughtered in 1838.
Sometimes described as Leviathans, sperm whales truly are creatures of mythical proportions. They have the largest teeth of any whale and live to be more than 60 years old. They can dive deeper than any other sea mammal (around 3km) in order to catch their favourite deep sea food, the elusive squid.
But it is the fact that they have the largest brains on Earth, ones that are more complex - in certain ways - than those of humans, that is perhaps most surprising. Their cerebral cortex is much more convoluted than the human cortex, and they are social creatures with strong bonds, staying in stable social groupings and keeping constant companions throughout their lifespan.
Dr Lindy Weilgart, a research associate in the department of biology at Dalhousie University in Canada, believes that in order ""to remember all their complex social relationships (families, more distantly related kin, non-related group members), they require a good memory"".
In fact, remembering traumatic past incidents could well have been the trigger for the whale that rammed the Essex.
""Briefly, I do believe a sperm whale is capable of the aggression necessary to attack a ship, especially a mother if her young was threatened,"" Dr Weilgart says.
""I know whalers in general often harpooned calves but kept them alive so as to attract the rest of the family group which came in aid of the calf.""
""They then harpooned those adults"", she says, a practice that was ""particularly cruel"".
However, Dr Bevan suggests that while ""the cetaceans do have large brainsâ¦ this is linked to their ability to process sound rather than being linked to what we regard as intelligence"".
Whether they can feel emotions like vengeance, is in dispute. It is possible that the whale changed course underwater at the last minute and unwittingly collided with the ship.
Dr Per Berggren, a lecturer in marine science at Newcastle University and specialist in marine mammals, believes this to be nearer the truth.
""It is perhaps more likely that the ship accidentally hit the whale and sustained a leak large enough to sink the vessel.""
But what is remarkable in the case of the Essex sinking, is that the whale came back to strike a second time.
First Mate Chase recalled: ""I turned around and saw himâ¦ directly ahead of us, coming down with twice his ordinary speedâ¦ with ten-fold fury and vengeance in his aspect.
""The surf flew in all directions about him with the continual violent thrashing of his tail. His head about half out of the water, and in that way he came upon us, and again struck the ship.
""The ship brought up as suddenly and violently as if she had struck a rock and trembled for a few minutes like a leaf.""
Latest research shows that whales are self-aware, sentient and more intelligent than previously thought. They can feel pain and suffering and therefore potentially a level of cognitive function; it is also now thought they can even experience feelings of love.
Sperm whales do not have many predators, killer whales (orcas) are known to have attacked sperm whales and occasionally sharks; but since the early 1700s by a large the most serious predator of sperm whales has been homo sapiens.
Whaling in the 19th century was a lucrative business as whale oil became immensely valuable for lighting oil lamps and making candles and soaps. More than 900 whaleships were out to sea in the mid-1800s, hailing mainly from American ports, with an average voyage length of three or four years.
By the mid 19th century, whale numbers were depleting rapidly. But with the discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania in 1859, the American whaling industry had almost completely disappeared by the start of World War I.
Whale hunting is now illegal in most parts of the world (though still practised by some nations such as Norway and Japan) and concerns about the welfare of whales in captivity are currently making waves in the news.
The documentary film Blackfish, about an orca in captivity at SeaWorld Orlando that was involved in several deaths, has recently caused controversy for the theme park. The documentary suggests that keeping the whales in captivity may be causing them to behave psychotically.
Acts including Willie Nelson and Barenaked Ladies have recently cancelled performances at the park in the wake of the film's release. But SeaWorld has issued a detailed rebuttal of claims in the film.
When First Mate Starbuck declares to Captain Ahab that ""Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!"" it's likely he was telling an awful and haunting truth.
Whether or not the sperm whale that attacked the whaleship Essex on the night of 20 November 1820 did so on purpose, we will never know. But the fascinating and undying rumour of his revenge certainly lives on.
The Whale will be shown on BBC One on Sunday 22nd December at 9pm.",Yes
264,53,DoS attack,New York attack: How did Trump do in his terror response?,1 November 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41812214,"As presidential candidate, Donald Trump made being tough on what he called ""radical Islamic terror"" a central plank of his election bid. How has he responded to the first test of this nature since taking office?
In the immediate aftermath of the attack in New York on Tuesday evening, Donald Trump offered a measured reaction.
His White House released a statement offering ""thoughts and prayers"", praising first responders and pledging federal support for the ongoing investigation.
The president tweeted that that the perpetrator was a ""very sick and deranged person"" - the same words he used to describe the man who killed more than 50 people in Las Vegas a month ago.
There were hints of what was to come, however. He tweeted about not allowing ""ISIS to return, or enter, our country"", and another about stepping up his ""extreme vetting"" border security programme.
Then, on Wednesday morning, the dam broke. These are some interesting points about what followed.
The president lashed out against Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer - who represents the state where the attack took place - for supporting an immigration lottery system that gives residency to 50,000 applicants from nations that do not send many of their citizens to the US.
He called on Congress to end the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, calling it ""a Chuck Schumer beauty"", although the system was set up in 1990 law that was passed with broad bipartisan support and signed by Republican President George HW Bush.
As Republican Senator Jeff Flake pointed out on Twitter, Mr Schumer was among a bipartisan group who recently tried to change the programme as part of comprehensive immigration reform.
Mr Trump also tweeted that Mr Schumer was trying to ""import Europes [sic] problems"", which prompted a dry response from the senator.
""I guess it's not too soon to politicise a tragedy,"" he tweeted.
Trump supporters have been quick to throw the hypocrisy flag on their ideological counterparts as well.
""Still waiting for liberal calls for immigration bans/reform like they do every time there's a gun attack,"" Donald Trump Jr, the president's eldest son, tweeted. ""Maybe hungover from Halloween?""
Since the president's criticisms, Mr Schumer has countered with his own policy recommendations - urging the president to back away from proposed budget cuts to anti-terrorism programmes.
""Our city relies on it to snuff out attacks,"" he tweeted.
It took less than 24 for hours for this latest incident to become drenched in politics.
In the aftermath of the devastating hurricanes that hit the US earlier this year and the Las Vegas attack in September, the White House had cautioned that heated debates about politics and policy should be delayed.
""To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm; versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced,"" Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt said in response to a question about climate change was Hurricane Irma headed toward the Florida coast.
""There will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that's not the place that we're in at this moment"" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the day after the Nevada mass shooting, the largest in modern US history.
When asked why Mr Trump had suggested that his proposed travel ban was necessary shortly after the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016, Sanders replied that ""there's a difference between being a candidate and being the president"".
When it came to the New York attack, however, President Trump followed the Orlando route.
The president's comments on Wednesday  stands in marked contrast to his reaction to other domestic terror attacks that have occurred during his presidency.
After a white nationalist in Charlottesville drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one, Mr Trump explained that he delayed commenting because ""unlike other politicians"", he wanted to make sure he knew all the facts before assigning blame.
""I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement,"" he said.
But the president's critics have pointed out his reticence when attacks involve perpetrators who are not Muslims.
He has not spoken at all about a man who was arrested on 6 October for trying to plant a nail bomb at an airport in Asheville, North Carolina. The suspect told police he wanted to ""fight a war on US soil"".
Mr Trump also  held his tongue when another man was arrested on terrorism charges on 19 October for detonating a bomb in a parking lot in Williamsburg, Virginia.
For the president, it seems, the New York attack - like the Orlando mass shooting - merited a different response.
So what changed between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning?
Mr Trump always seems to be at his most rambunctious on Twitter in the morning - in part because he likes to spend the time watching his favourite news programme, Fox & Friends.
On Wednesday the show featured guests - including former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka and retired Lt Colonel Tony Shaffer - who repeatedly laid the blame for the New York attacks on US immigration policies they said were backed by Mr Schumer and Democrats.
The president followed the show's lead. In two of his tweets, he included the Fox & Friends Twitter handle.
It has become a recurring occurrence during the Trump presidency. The Fox News morning show runs a segment on a controversial topic, and the president quickly fires off tweets on a similar theme.
Whether the subject is flag-burning, NFL protests, Confederate monuments, healthcare, immigration, Fox & Friends has become a window into the president's mind and a preview of tweets to come. Wednesday morning was only the latest example.",Yes

The attack forced down Twitter for two hours on 6 August, and Cyxymu now wants Mr Medvedev to find the culprits. Despite the blogger's claims, security researchers have said they doubt the attack was state-endorsed. As well as Twitter and Facebook, search giant Google and blogging platform LiveJournal - all sites where the blogger holds accounts - were also affected. In an open letter to Mr Medvedev, the blogger, whose real name is Georgy, appealed for an investigation into the attack, during which the affected websites were bombarded with data requests until they crashed. ""Your special services are able to trace the persons involved in this case and organisers of this attack,"" he wrote. ""And your court, the most humane court in the world, is able to find and punish them. "" 'Big surprise'He also said that last week's so-called denial-of-service (DoS) attack was not the first against his blog.





Facebook was not taken completely offline by the attack




In October 2008 his blog at livejournal.com was hit and did not function again until May this year. In his letter, Georgy said that ""the entire world is speaking of the Russian hackers working for the Russian Federation government"". Those hackers were able to prevent millions of people gaining access to world famous social networking sites merely ""to block one blogger"" because of his ""unpleasant and unacceptable"" position, he suggested. Georgy has posted a series of videos and blog entries criticising Russia for its conduct during the five-day conflict with Georgia a year ago over its disputed region of South Ossetia. Last week he expressed his surprise at the fallout from his blogging, saying: ""It's a big surprise to me that my blog has meant that 250m people have not been able to enter Facebook."" However, Graham Cluley of security firm Sophos told BBC News last week there was no suggestion the attack against the blogger was state-endorsed. ""It was almost certainly an individual who took objection to his blogs,"" Mr Cluley said. ""They took internet vigilantism into their own hands to try to blast him off the web, but in the process blasted Twitter off instead."" Spam campaignSecurity experts at Facebook confirmed that the attack was directed at an individual ""rather than the sites themselves"". ""A botnet was directed to request his pages at such a rate that it impacted service for other users,"" the spokesperson said. Botnets are networks of computers under the control of hackers. The machines were used to mount a DoS attack on Thursday. DOS attacks often involve a company's servers being flooded with data in an effort to disable them. A spam campaign, containing links to Cyxymu pages on the various sites, coincided with and compounded the attack. Although Facebook was back up and running within hours, Twitter continued to feel the effects into the weekend whilst LiveJournal has said it has continued to be attacked. Taking to BBC News following the attack, Cyxymu, said that he had noticed that things were not right when he realised his Live Journal page was not working. ""After, I entered Facebook to say LiveJournal was not working and Facebook was down,"" he said. ""So I entered Twitter to say that LiveJournal and Facebook were not working, and Twitter was down. ""And so I understood that it was under attack. It is not possible that these three services were all down at one time.""

268,57,DoS attack,Sven Badzak death: Stabbing was 'random attack' by six men,12 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-56043662,"An aspiring lawyer was ""randomly stabbed to death"" by a group of six men as he bought a bagel, police say.
Sven Badzak was waiting outside a bagel shop in Kilburn, north-west London, with his 16-year-old friend when the pair were attacked last Saturday.
A 19-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murdering the 22-year-old have been released on bail.
The victims did not know their attackers and police do not believe they were robbed, the Met said.
Mr Badzak's mother, Jasna, said she believes her son was killed in a random attack.
She said her son, who was privately educated at Wetherby and Portland Place schools before attending Roehampton University, had gone to a shop to get orange juice and then to a bagel shop when he was attacked.
As he and his friend were chased at around 17:30 GMT, they became separated and Mr Badzak, from Maida Hill, west London, fell to the ground and was stabbed repeatedly.
The 16-year-old also suffered multiple stab injuries but managed to escape into a shop in Willesden Lane. He is currently in a stable condition in hospital.
Det Ch Insp Mark Wrigley said the attack was ""unprovoked"" and ""happened very quickly"".
""It happened very, very quickly and Sven and his young friend were attacked for no reason that we know of at this time.
""There were six who attacked the two young men. The two who have been arrested have now been released on bail.
""We are still conducting our inquiries to confirm the identity of all of those who took part. This group of young men came to that area and moved together as a group before the offence.""
The group consisted of a mixture of white and black males, he said.
Ms Badzak said her son, who had a degree in sociology but wanted to become a lawyer, had met Boris Johnson and other well-known Conservative politicians when he was younger.
The Prime Minister said ""absolutely everything"" is being done to tackle violent crime after Ms Badzak, a consultant and financial analyst, called on him to help ensure her son's killers are caught.",Yes
269,58,DoS attack,GoDaddy hosted websites down 'in possible hack attack',10 September 2012,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19549367,"Thousands of websites hosted by one of the world's biggest internet domain registrars and web hosts, GoDaddy, were reported down on Monday.
""Status Alert: Hey, all. We're aware of the trouble people are having with our site. We're working on it,"" the website host said.
One Twitter feed allegedly linked to Anonymous claimed credit for a hack but the cause is far from clear.
GoDaddy said later that most websites were back online.
It said on its Twitter account: ""We're working out the last few kinks for our site & control centers. No customer data compromised.""
Earlier, the company, which hosts millions of sites around the world, apologised for the frustration of some of its customers.
One Twitter feed, @AnonymousOwn3r, had said that ""all servers"" of Go Daddy had been taken down.
The account of AnonymousOwn3r identifies itself as the ""security leader"" of the group, but said in subsequent tweets that the attack was carried out alone and not on behalf of the organisation.
""it is not Anonymous coletive it's only me don't use Anonymous coletive name on it, just my name,"" the person said in the feed.
Another went: ""i'm taking godaddy down bacause well i'd like to test how the cyber security is safe and for more reasons that i can not talk now.""
A spokesperson for GoDaddy told the BBC that the firm was directing all inquiries to its @GoDaddy Twitter feed. ""You could say it's been a busy day,"" he said.
Rick Ferguson, director of security research at the computer firm, Trend Micro, told the BBC that, while it was a ""blunt instrument"", a denial-of-service attack was very effective.
""What I've seen and heard is it was a DoS attack on the DNS infrastructure,"" he said.
The Domain Name System, in essence, translates the readable computer hostnames into IP addresses.
""If it is true, then that has not been constructed to scale up in a sizeable DDos. The GoDaddy site can cope with a sizeable amount of traffic, but its DNS may not have been.
""Of course, that's speculation and without confirmation from GoDaddy on the nature of the attack, we don't yet know the full facts,"" he added.
One Twitter feed that has been used to claim credit for Anonymous attacks in the past made reference to the disruption and then said: ""Please redirect your godaddy hate to @AnonymousOwn3r says is the 'leader' of Anonymous. #derp Have #lulz with that.""
Anonymous is a loosely organised collective of hackers and hacking advocates.
GoDaddy provides hosting services around the world and said it had $1.1bn (Â£687m) in sales in 2011.
Attacks on major sites under the banner of Anonymous have become much more common.
In early June, members of Anonymous staged protests in 16 cities in India against what they said was internet censorship in the country and in April, Anonymous also claimed responsibility for defacing almost 500 websites in China.

270,59,DoS attack,Bristol protest: Why are people angry about possible changes to protest laws?,22 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/56482384,"A protest in Bristol has been described as ""shameful"" and ""completely unacceptable"".
Thousands joined the demonstration which took place on Sunday, despite people being ""strongly advised"" by police not to attend.
Although it started off peaceful, later on there were violent clashes between protesters and police.
Staff from Bristol Waste - the company responsible for waste collection and street cleaning in the city - spent Monday morning removing broken glass, debris and offensive graffiti from the streets.
So, what happened and why were people protesting?

Can horses recognise themselves in mirrors?!
On Sunday, crowds gathered to peacefully protest against planned changes the laws around demonstrations and how they are policed.
Later on though, around 300 people remained and angry scenes started to unfold.
Avon and Somerset Police said what had started ""as a peaceful protest"" had been ""turned by a small minority into a violent disorder"". A number of police officers were injured, vans were set on fire, damage was caused to a police station and people have been arrested.
The protest was organised over plans to give police more precise powers to restrict demonstrations.
The government's proposed some law changes on crime and justice in England and Wales in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. It's being debated by Members of Parliament this week.
One part of it, covers changes to protests.
At the moment, if police say they want to limit a protest - for example to keep the public safe and prevent crime -  they generally have to show it may result in ""serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"".
They can then impose specific measures, for example restricting the route of a march, and typically when it comes to major events, the police and organisers will try and work out a plan together weeks in advance.
The proposed change, would mean police chiefs will be able to put more conditions on static (non-moving) protests, including imposing a start and finish time and setting noise limits. These rules would also apply to a demonstration by just one person.
For example, under the new law, if someone held a one-person demo and refused to follow police directions over how they should protest - they could be fined up to £2,500.
Also at the moment, police need to prove protesters knew they had been told to move on, before they can be said to have broken the law, under the new proposals, it will also become a crime to fail to follow restrictions the protesters ""ought"" to have known about, even if they have not received a direct order from an officer.
The proposed law also includes an offence of ""intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance"". The aim of this is to stop people occupying public spaces and using other protest tactics to make themselves seen and heard.
Damage to memorials could also lead to up to 10 years in prison. It's after a statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down during a demo in Bristol last year.
Government ministers and the police have been working together on the proposals and Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said she ""absolutely"" supported the ""right to peaceful protest"".
Police chiefs have been frustrated in the past that they haven't been able to do more to lessen the impact of demonstrations, for example those by environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion in 2019.
They argue that mass occupations of roads and bridges in London and elsewhere stretched police resources.
Some people argue that the new rules would affect people's right to protest.
They argue the Bill goes against international human rights laws - the right to protest and express yourself is part of the Human Rights Act.
Kate Allen, Director of human rights charity Amnesty International, said: ""The Bill itself is so broad in scope that it is a threat to everybody. Threatening the rights to peaceful protest is only one alarming area of new policing powers... Temporary restrictions on our civil liberties during a time of pandemic are one thing - but a law that permanently restricts the right to peaceful protest is totally unacceptable.""
The Home Office insists its proposals will respect human rights.
Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said he recognised ""the frustrations"" with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but said that ""smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through"".",Yes

The 21-year-old musician, who performs under the names K or K-Dogg, had just finished a shift at Bristol's Southmead Hospital when a car was driven at him.
Six months later, he has appealed for help in bringing his attackers to justice.
He urged anyone with information to ""do the courageous thing"".
K, who has asked for his full name not to be used, had said goodbye to a friend and put his headphones on when a dark blue Honda Accord was driven into him on Monks Park Avenue, at about 16.30 BST on 22 July.
He was thrown into the front garden of a house by the impact of the crash and said the occupants of the car shouted racist abuse at him before running off.
Four men arrested in connection with the attack remain released under investigation while inquiries, including detailed forensic examinations, continue.
The musician is still recovering from his injuries and is being supported by an Avon and Somerset Police family liaison officer and SARI (Stand Against Racism & Inequality).
""It is now six months since I survived a racially-aggravated attempted murder. A cowardly, brazen attack carried out in broad daylight,"" he said.
""My attackers broke my body. Their violence touched the soul of my family, friends, fellow Bristolians and beyond.
""But my attackers didn't break my heart nor Bristol's heart. It's clearly only a matter of time until they are caught.""
K reiterated his thanks to passers-by who came to his aid immediately after the attack, which left him unable to walk and bleeding profusely from his head.
He was treated by his colleagues at Southmead Hospital for a broken leg, nose and cheekbone and also needed plastic surgery.
Doctors told him had he not been so physically fit, he would have died at the scene.
""I would again like to thank all those that came to my aid, administered care, sent me well wishes, donated money - including Bristol's Massive Attack - and those that continue to provide my medical care,"" said K.
""Unfortunately for medical reasons I'm not able to return to my NHS duties just yet. But I'm bouncing back and hope to join them soon. Respect to my NHS colleagues who are fighting Covid.
""If you are reading this and can help the police catch my attackers, do the right and courageous thing.""
Det Insp Danielle Underwood said: ""I and my team are working hard and painstakingly to build a case for charging those responsible for K's horrendous injuries.
""We understand the frustration over the time this complex investigation is taking - we feel it too - but we're determined to do this right to get justice for K.""

273,62,DoS attack,Bitcoin exchange halts withdrawals after cyber-attack,12 February 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26155157,"Bitstamp - one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges - has halted withdrawals after coming under cyber-attack.
The Slovenia-based firm said the culprits had exploited a bug in the virtual currency's underlying software to carry out the assault.
It is the second exchange to suspend operations. Tokyo's MtGox took a similar measure on Friday.
A third, Bulgaria's BTC-e, has warned that some transactions may be delayed.
Like Bitstamp, it cited a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as the cause.
The Bitcoin Foundation - a group of developers who maintain and promote the cryptographic code on which the currency relies - said that it was creating workarounds and fixes to tackle the issue.
It added that people who had funds stored with the affected exchanges should know that their savings were safe, albeit ""tied up"" for the time being.
""This is a denial-of-service attack; whoever is doing this is not stealing coins, but is succeeding in preventing some transactions from confirming,"" wrote Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the foundation.
""It's important to note that DoS attacks do not affect people's Bitcoin wallets or funds.""
The cause of the problem is an issue called transaction malleability.
It involves someone changing the cryptographic code - known as a transaction hash - used to create an ID for the exchange of funds before it is recorded in the blockchain - a database of every transaction carried out in the currency.
On Monday, MtGox had suggested that this technique could be used to fool its systems into repeatedly making a payout because it would seem that it had not occurred.
The Bitcoin Foundation's initial response was that transaction malleability had been known about since 2011, and that MtGox should have prepared for this when developing its own customised software, which was now proving vulnerable.
""This is something that cannot be corrected overnight,"" wrote Mr Andresen.
But while other exchanges are not complaining about the risk of making unauthorised payouts, it appears their systems can become overwhelmed if they receive too many ""mutated versions"" of the transaction IDs.
""This is a denial-of-service attack made possible by some misunderstandings in Bitcoin wallet implementations,"" said Bitstamp's blog.
""These misunderstandings have simple solutions that are being implemented as we speak, and we're confident everything will be back to normal shortly.""
The Bitcoin Foundation now says its members and developers from a number of exchanges are working ""collectively and collaboratively"" to tackle the problem and allow withdrawals to resume.
One bitcoin is currently trading for about $665 (Â£402). That is well below the $830 level it was at last Thursday, reflecting investors' concern at the news.
However, one expert said the virtual currency should emerge from the attacks more robust than before.
""Obviously it's a bit more serious than was initially thought - it was originally believed that it was just a problem at MtGox because of the way they had set up their systems,"" Emily Spaven, editor of the news site Coindesk, told the BBC.
""The view from developers is that the exchanges should be processing bitcoin withdrawals again within 48-72 hours, though the wider issue of transaction malleability will take longer to address.
""It's been a bit of a wake-up call to get this issue fixed. I suppose they previously thought it wasn't that big a deal.""",Yes
274,63,DoS attack,Bookies suffer online onslaught,19 March 2004,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3549883.stm,"Attacks took place before the Cheltenham Festival 





	Working with server monitoring firm Netcraft, BBC News Online has been keeping an eye on the UK's top 20 betting sites since 1 March.

Netcraft monitors website performance by timing how long it takes a specific server or website to respond when sent a packet of data.

It monitors the response times via servers sited in different hosting centres around the world. Servers being monitored are sent query packets every 15 minutes.
Attack pattern

Since the monitoring started, 33 outages have been reported. Only five bookmakers have had no outages over the monitoring period.

Some outages do not last long and occur late at night and are probably connected with site maintenance rather than an attack.

Others, perhaps half of those logged, occur during the day and many show a characteristic pattern of a web server struggling to cope with the amount of requests it is getting. 

Sometimes this will be due to heavy traffic when big sports events are on such as the Six Nations and Uefa cup matches.

Occasionally the outages are caused by a Denial of Service attack.

In a DoS attack, a server is deluged with requests for information from thousands of PCs at the same time. 

When this happens the response time of the server climbs before it stops reacting once it has been overwhelmed. Soon after, it recovers and the cycle starts again.

Netcraft monitors the website of the Recording Industry Association of America which is suffering a DoS attack by machines infected with the MyDoom.F worm. 






Some sites were out of action for hours





	
Betting sites contacted by BBC News Online when these outages were taking place declined to comment on what was causing the problems.

Mike Prettejohn, president of Netcraft, said: ""In the general case, we can't say authoritatively why a site isn't available, just when it isn't available.""

He said surges in response times followed by an outage could be the result of a routing problem, bandwidth congestion, or server overload.
Extortion demand

However, this week the response times from the betting sites became much easier to interpret when several sites admitted that they had been targeted by the extortionists.

William Hill, Betdaq, Totalbet and UKBetting all said that they had been attacked or received extortion demands by criminals prior to the start of the Cheltenham Festival on 15 March.

Gambling sites have been targeted because so many of the events they offer odds on are time-limited.

A spokesman for William Hill said the attack started on 11 March and continued into Friday.

""We knew we would be a target at some stage,"" he said.

""The crux is that we will not give into extortion,"" he said, ""we never have and never will.""

The spokesman added that DoS attacks on betting sites by extortionists were a global problem.

Irish bookmaker Paddy Power was also attacked during the Superbowl.

The sites attacked before the Cheltenham festival show the characteristic pattern of increasing response times and then suddenly no response from the server as it gets overwhelmed.






Classic DoS traffic pattern at the RIAA site





	
The attacks seem to be well co-ordinated as the servers being targeted are overwhelmed very quickly.

Once attacked the websites of the gambling sites stay offline for hours.

Earlier this week the website of Totalbet was offline from mid-morning on 16 March to early afternoon on the 17th in an outage that had all the signs of a DoS attack.

Fighting back

A spokesman for the Bookmakers Fraud Forum declined the chance to comment as he did not want to give away any information about police investigations into attacks.

A spokeswoman for the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit said: ""The NHTCU is well aware of these attacks and has been investigating UK cases since the autumn.

She added: ""We are working closely with the UK bookmakers in tracing and tracking down the perpetrators.""

She said she could not add any more details because the investigations were active and ongoing.

Rob Pollard, from security firm Arbor Networks, said in many cases bookmakers would struggle to cope with a DoS attack because the connection to their net service provider will be swamped by bad traffic.

""It became clear quite a few years ago that DoS attacks are a service providers problem,"" he said.

But, he said, tools existed to help net providers spot DoS traffic and stop it causing problems for net users.",Yes

Josemar Costa, 28, now of Peterborough, denied the 2014 rape but was found guilty after trial at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
He admitted sexually assaulting another woman on the same night.
Costa was sentenced to a total of eight years and ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life for what police described as ""vile sex attacks"".
Costa, who was living in Cheltenham Street, Oldham, at the time of the attack was also issued with four restraining orders.
Police said he was at a nightclub on Roscoe Street, Oldham, for a work-related Christmas party when he attacked his first victim on 4 December.
As he left the club he pulled a woman sat on the pavement to her feet, police said.
The woman resisted but Costa tried to kiss her and then sexually assaulted her.
As the victim's friends stepped in to help her, Costa pushed her to the floor before fleeing.
He went back to his flat with a number of people from the party and continued to drink alcohol, police reported.
Costa then carried his second victim, who was chatting to friends, out of the room against her will.
He took her into the bathroom and raped her.

280,69,DoS attack,"Velindre Cancer Centre plans 'risky', say clinicians",10 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-56339060,"Plans for a new cancer hospital in Cardiff are ""risky"" for patients, two experienced clinicians have said.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething is expected to announce whether the new Â£180m Velindre Cancer Centre in Whitchurch will be backed this week.
But the clinicians are concerned about the possible number of patient transfers from the centre to a larger hospital and the time that takes.
Health bosses said ""safety and care is at the heart of everything we do"".
Velindre NHS Trust has previously said only 30 patients were transferred a year between its current cancer centre and Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.
About 10 were designated as red, the most serious, by the ambulance service.
But, following a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, clinicians found the transfers were closer to 100 in recent years.
The plans for the new hospital have led to protests and a petition signed by more than 7,500 people, opposed to it being built on the Northern Meadows site in Whitchurch.
The dispute over ambulance transfers has raised further concerns about the planned hospital.
The clinicians have said they are also concerned Velindre might have played down the seriousness of amber calls.
There have been more than 70 red or amber calls each year in recent years, according to the FOI request.
The two clinicians - who asked to remain anonymous - discovered that average transfer times for amber calls in 2019 was just under an hour, with another 45 minutes to be transferred to the ward after arriving at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.
One of the clinicians said: ""The amber category are very unwell patients who need to have urgent care.
""It's not the eight-minute response for heart attack but they do need help and that help can't be provided at Velindre.""
They said amber calls can include patients having breathing difficulties, stroke, or major haemorrhage.
""So the amber category are very unwell patients who need to have urgent care,"" added the medic.
""The idea that these are routine calls using the 999 system is disingenuous... they're definitely downplaying the figures.""
The clinicians warned that developments in immunotherapy meant there was a greater risk of patients suffering side effects and claim the new Velindre should be on the site of a larger hospital such as the University Hospital of Wales.
They added the Northern Meadows proposal was outdated and the trust should look to build a centre similar to the new Clatterbridge cancer hospital at Wirral.
""I'm not just expressing a personal opinion - I'm speaking for 30 clinicians at Velindre, 57 doctors who signed a letter last year and the 163 senior clinicians who recently signed a letter to the health secretary,"" said one of the clinicians.
""All of whom have expressed concerns that building an isolated unit here on the Northern Meadows, without intensive care, high dependency and all the other backup you need for sick patients, is extremely risky.""
Both clinicians said they have chosen to remain anonymous due to fear of online trolling and harassment.
In literature provided to the Senedd ahead of the petitions committee last week, Velindre said that, over the past five years, no serious incidents had been reported to Welsh Government due to preventable deaths on-site relating to a delay in transfer to an acute hospital, or due to the lack of critical care or anaesthetic support onsite.
It said: ""Velindre Cancer Centre treats some of Wales' most vulnerable patients - their safety and care is at the heart of everything we do and we work closely with our staff and colleagues in university health boards to provide the best cancer services possible for the people of south-east Wales.
""The need for a new Velindre Cancer Centre is clear.
""The current building cannot sustain high quality patient care indefinitely given the age of the building and the increasing number of cancer diagnoses.""
The trust said a recent review found co-locating the new cancer centre at the University Hospital of Wales would ""not be an option for some time"" and action was required now to improved regional cancer services.
A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We have conducted detailed scrutiny of the outline business cases for the new Velindre Cancer Centre and its enabling works.
""Welsh ministers are now considering the outcome of this formal process and a decision will be announced in due course.""",Yes
281,70,DoS attack,Venezuela crisis: Diplomat to US defects from Maduro,27 January 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-47019347,"Venezuela's top military representative to the US has defected from NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government.
Col JosÃ© Luis Silva says he now recognises opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as president instead.
Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself ""acting president"" on Wednesday, gaining the backing of several countries including the US.
Meanwhile, Mr Maduro has rejected demands by European countries to call elections.
Several countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said on Saturday they would recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections were not called within eight days.
""They should withdraw this ultimatum. Venezuela is not tied to Europe. This is complete insolence,"" Mr Maduro told CNN Turk.
President Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging, leading to large anti-Maduro protests.
Tens of thousands have protested against Mr Maduro, but, crucially, he has retained the support of the country's military so far.
The security forces are seen as the key player in this crisis, and Mr GuaidÃ³ has asked them to ""put themselves on the side of the Venezuelan people"".
In a video, filmed at the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, Col Silva called for free elections and urged his ""brothers in the armed forces of the nation to recognise President Juan GuaidÃ³ as the only legitimate president"".
""The armed forces have a fundamental role in the restoration of the democracy in our country. Please, brothers, do not attack our people,"" he said.
Later, he told Reuters news agency that two other Venezuelan consular officials in the US also recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as leader.
It is not clear whether more members of the military will be encouraged to defect.
Mr GuaidÃ³ thanked Col Silva and urged others to join him, while Venezuela's defence ministry said Col Silva was guilty of treason, and tweeted photos of him with the word ""traitor"" on it.
Meanwhile, Mr Maduro has backed down over his demand that all US diplomats leave the country.
Mr Maduro, accusing Mr GuaidÃ³ of attempting a coup, broke off relations with the US on Thursday and ordered US envoys to depart within 72 hours.
Washington said it did not recognise his authority to order them out.
On Saturday evening, as the deadline was due to expire, Venezuela's foreign ministry said it would withdraw the expulsion order, and instead allow 30 days for the two sides to set up ""interest offices"" in each others' countries.
Interest offices are used when countries do not have formal diplomatic relations, but want to have a basic level of contact to represent their interests.
Russia, China, Mexico and Turkey have publicly backed Mr Maduro.
At a UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, Russia accused Washington of plotting a coup.
However, more than a dozen Latin American countries and Canada have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ as president.
In Europe, Greece's left-wing ruling party has backed Mr Maduro.
Venezuela is in economic crisis - hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials has hit its population hard and caused millions to flee.
Mr Maduro has faced internal opposition and ongoing international criticism for his human rights record and handling of the economy.
He was re-elected to a second term last year - but the elections were controversial, with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed.

283,72,DoS attack,George Floyd death: What US police officers think of protests,26 June 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53159496,"When massive protests against police brutality broke out across the US in May 2020, Charles Billups was not at all surprised.
A black policeman in New York for decades before his retirement, the former officer, 60, tells the BBC: ""It's the chickens coming home to roost"".
""This is something that's been mustering for a while,"" says Mr Billups.
Not for the first time has anger against law enforcement in America spilt out into demands for change - national attempts to reform the country's patchwork of nearly 18,000 police departments have periodically cropped up since the early 20th Century.
But outrage over a spate of deaths of black Americans at the hands of police, especially the death of George Floyd, a former club bouncer asphyxiated during an arrest, has spurred a clear bout of soul-searching within police departments themselves.
Officers are divided over if and how reforms should come about.
For Mr Billups, now chairman of the Grand Council of Guardians, an organisation for African-American law enforcement officers in New York state, the problems lie at the top.
A policy of tough policing put forward in the 1980s, the so-called ""broken windows"" theory, has long been destructive for relations between minorities and law enforcement, Mr Billups says.
Only recently have authorities begun to step away from more draconian principles, but Mr Billups thinks that a belief in the efficacy of tough tactics persists among the mostly white, and long-entrenched, leadership of many police departments.
""The head is the thinker. The body's going to conform to the head. If the head is not healthy, the body's not going to gain weight.
""You gotta change the top,"" says Mr Billups. ""It's a large number of [people who believe in] old-school policing that's still running a lot of these agencies, and the old-school way of thinking just doesn't work no more.""
Black officers have always known and felt differently, says Terence Hopkins of the Dallas police department.
""We happen to be African-American people before we were law enforcement,"" he says, ""so that gives us a different view as opposed to our white counterparts.""
Surveys bear this out. A 2016 poll of nearly 8,000 US police oficers by the Pew Research think tank found that 69% of black officers believed that the country needed to ""continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites"", compared to just 6% of white officers.
The survey, taken in the aftermath of another spate of fatal encounters between police and African-Americans, found that a majority of white and Latino officers believed such events were isolated incidents.
By contrast, 57% of black officers said they were signs of a broader problem with policing.
Polls of police in the wake of the recent fatal encounters have yet to emerge, but anecdotally, more officers today seem to agree that the problem goes beyond individuals and needs a systematic approach.
White as well as black officers have supported the protests and have publicly called for reforms.
""What's happening now is a movement for police reform in our country,"" says Mr Hopkins, who has been a police officer for 30 years.
Some of the ideas that have become popular in the larger cultural conversation, such as diverting money and duties to fund mental health and social work, he agrees with wholeheartedly, he says.
More must be done to recruit minority officers. In Dallas, there is a conscious policy to make the force reflect the demographics of the city it serves.
But Mr Hopkins says he also understands why there is resistance to change.
""You tend to be protective of your industry. When individuals say, 'you're doing something wrong,' we tend to go the other direction, or not admit our fault in it.""
Mr Billups agrees that ""it's a big split. You have one faction that's saying there's a need for change, and then you have another faction in these departments that want to keep it as status quo.""
Some officers have expressed anger over the backlash on policing and calls to defund or disband departments (though these are not always calls to abolish police, as some have taken them to mean).
A viral video circulated in recent weeks of members of the New York Benevolent Association, seen as a traditionally more conservative union for rank-and-file officers, venting at perceived mistreatment of police amid the protests.
""Stop treating us like 'animals' and 'thugs',"" Mike O'Meara, head of the union, tells reporters. ""I am not Derek Chauvin. They are not him,"" he said referring to the police officer who killed George Floyd in Minneapolis.
""Everybody's trying to shame us. The legislators. The press. Everybody's trying to shame us into being embarrassed of our profession,"" he says. ""We've been left out of the conversation. We've been vilified. It's disgusting.""
On Facebook, Blue Lives Matter - a counter group to Black Lives Matter that advocates for police interest - has over 2.2m endorsers.
Supporters say police deserve sympathy for doing a difficult job, and that ""radical"" proposals to disband departments would lead to anarchy and lawlessness.
Indeed, such reforms can have mixed results. Camden, a working-class town in New Jersey, has been hailed as a model for success after disbanding its troubled police force in 2013, redirecting energies to neighbourhood patrolling.
However, in Vallejo, California, outside San Francisco, fatal encounters with police rose dramatically in the years after it disbanded force, in 2008.
""It's just really tough,"" says Robert McCormick, a retired police and parole officer. ""Everybody wants a simple answer, but there isn't one.""
There are many complexities even with reforms that sound reasonable, he points out.
For example, getting mental health specialists to deal with issues police are not equipped to deal with - a large chunk of calls Mr McCormick, 72, saw in his decades on the job in the Midwest and Colorado - would seem prudent.
But officers would have no way of knowing when they answer an emergency ""911"" call that mental illness is the issue at hand.
With nearly one in three Americans owning a gun, risks for officers can be high.
Rather than reducing funds, Mr McCormick thinks, there should be supplemental funds for training and alternative resources for police.
He thinks protections for police do need to remain in place, such as preserving ""qualified immunity"" - another concept that has come under pressure amid the recent protests.
The doctrine shields officers from being held personally liable for violating the constitutional rights of people they arrest.
Critics argue that this thwarts attempts to hold officers accountable, but Mr McCormick says it is necessary to protect police who are trying to do their jobs. ""It says you can't sue me just for arresting you, just for doing my job,"" he says.
""[The police] are being attacked,"" he says. ""But [on the other hand], it's so damned hard to get rid of a cop who's bad or not doing his jobâ¦ it's pretty damn near impossible to convict a cop. That's ridiculous.""
Ultimately, it will be changes that take place within departments themselves that affect long-term results, thinks the Grand Council's Mr Billups.
""The key thing now is that there's changes in the department,"" he says. ""You're talking about officers who are black or Latino. They go back to those same neighbourhoods where they're policing. [So] a lot of the young black officers see it a different way.""
But more importantly, he says, it is that police departments as a whole need to ""learn a new language"" to evaluate the purpose and priorities of the job. ""Departments need to evolve to the 21st Century"".

It took several days before I could bring myself to watch George Floyd's life agonisingly extinguished beneath the unyielding knee of a Minneapolis police officer. As a sworn police officer, I believe it is my duty to watch and not look away; George Floyd's humanity demands it.
His unconscionable death laid bare the deficiencies of American policing, a reality which resonated with cities and communities across the nation. Viral images and video clips documenting protests against racism and brutality have done little to disconfirm that the police are racist and brutal. Calls to re-imagine, defund, or even abolish the institution of policing are amplified through these encounters.
A friend from my undergraduate days recently lamented on Facebook that she did not know how to explain the police to her children. Rhetorical or not, I inquired whether she meant ""police as they are"" or ""police as they should be?""
Policing is a social institution with an uncertain mandate and mismatched expectations invariably leads to conflict. Reductionist phrases such as ""to serve and protect"" are of little help as they are ambiguous and easily co-opted.
The field of policing desperately needs to do some soul-searching and reconsider what it stands for professionally. Rewriting its code of ethics is a good place to start.
The current Law Enforcement Code of Ethics is a product of the mid-20th Century's professional era of policing. It was formally adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 1957.
The document is more than symbolic; many police organisations (including the Minneapolis Police Department) have incorporated the Code of Ethics into their policy manuals and oath of office ceremonies. Police reform often takes place in a patchwork fashion.
Changing the Code of Ethics would be unprecedented and wide-reaching. To draft a new Code of Ethics worthy of a democratic society, policing should turn to Hippocrates.
Medicine's Hippocratic Oath is commonly summarised as ""do no harm"".
It is the physician's job to examine the patient, diagnose the medical condition underlying presenting symptoms, and prescribe an effective course of treatment. A doctor who only attends to visible symptoms, provides ineffective medicine, or treats in a manner that is ultimately harmful has failed the patient.
By these standards, American policing may be guilty of malpractice.
A police code of ethics designed around the Hippocratic Oath should incorporate four key themes that are noticeably absent from the present document: evidence-based policing; crime prevention; professional identity; and the sanctity of life.;
In the decades following the code's inception, a vast body of scientific evidence has emerged regarding what works in policing and, perhaps more importantly, what does not.
This is not an abstract intellectual issue since police interventions directly impact the lives of community members. Ignoring the evidence base in favour of tradition or personal opinion is more than irresponsible; unscientific policing is unethical policing.
Second, the Code of Ethics is a product of the crime-control era and is singularly focused on enforcement. The desire to apprehend is dominant in American policing's DNA, yet this orientation must give way to crime prevention. It is the absence of crime and disorder that policing should seek to achieve.
Third, the Code of Ethics must repudiate the ideology of the ""thin blue line"". It must clearly establish that police are first and foremost members of the community, not some separate caste standing in the gap between good and evil.
Finally, the Code of Ethics rightly speaks to protecting the weak and innocent while opposing unnecessary force and violence. This does not go far enough.
Policing must fundamentally acknowledge the sanctity of life and a duty to protect every person, even individuals who have placed themselves or others in jeopardy. If police must use force, they have an ethical duty to transition and render aid to prevent the loss of life.
As George Floyd lay dying, one of the bystanders in the crowd tried to reason with the officers declaring, ""Bro, he's human."" The appeal fell on deaf ears.
Hippocrates viewed the art of medicine as something fundamentally connected with the love of humanity. The very fabric of American policing must change before the same can be said about law enforcement. It's time for a new code.",Yes

Eloise Dixon, 46, from Gravesend, was in a car with her husband and children in Angra dos Reis on Sunday when the attack happened, according to reports.
Ms Dixon, 46, was shot twice, once in the abdomen, and is now recovering.
Max Dixon, 46, a Bromley firefighter and former paratrooper ""dealt with the situation calmly,"" Hazel Dixon said.
""He just wanted to get out of it as quickly as possible - to the nearest hospital.
""He told me the car was riddled with bullets,"" she added.
The attack occurred in the first week of their family holiday.
The couple had been travelling in the car with their three children Isabella, 13, Holly, eight, and seven-year-old Alice.
It is believed a language mix-up led the family, from Hayes, south-east London, into the Agua Santa neighbourhood - a coastal resort about 90 miles (145 km) from Rio de Janeiro.
Authorities said a group approached the car and told the family to get out, but the Dixons did not understand the request.
The group then reportedly opened fire.
Ms Dixon said her daughter-in-law, a part-time classroom assistant at a primary school in Hayes, was lucky to be alive.
She said the family, who travelled a lot and liked to go to adventurous places, were just one week into a three week holiday when the attack happened.
The 46-year-old underwent two hours of surgery and is now in a stable condition waiting to be transferred to a private hospital in Rio de Janeiro.",Yes
285,74,DoS attack,Bristol protest: Police attacked as 'Kill the Bill' demo turns violent,21 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-56477887,"Protesters have attacked police after thousands of people turned up to a demonstration that officers had ""strongly advised"" against attending.
Officers suffered broken bones and police vans were set alight as angry scenes unfolded in Bristol city centre.
Crowds had gathered for the Kill the Bill demonstration in opposition to the Police and Crime Bill.
Demonstrators scaled a police station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls.
Home Secretary Priti Patel described the events as ""unacceptable"".
""Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,"" she said. ""Our police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect us all.""
Avon and Somerset Police said what had started ""as a peaceful protest"" had been ""turned by a small minority into a violent disorder"".
Two police vehicles were set on fire, damage was caused to a police station, one officer suffered a broken arm and another suffered broken ribs, the force added.
By Joanna Prior, BBC News
At the beginning of the night the mood was generally lively but not aggressive.
There was broken glass across the road and some people had climbed on top of traffic lights but there was no police intervention.
The dense crowd eventually splintered, with some moving away to carry on drinking and listen to music.
The atmosphere among those who remained became more volatile.
Riot police in full protective gear formed a barricade in front of the station, but the officers didn't engage with the protesters at all.
They stood by as their shields and vans were daubed with graffiti - some of it profane and some of it hostile towards the police themselves and Home Secretary Priti Patel.
Then the atmosphere took a marked turn when the first police vehicle was set on fire. Huge plumes of black smoke rose up from Bridewell Street.
A small number of protesters jumped on to the roof of a second police van, thumping on the glass as the officers tried to reverse.
Objects were being thrown by protesters into the crowd and still the police did not move from their positions.
As well as the police vehicles set on fire, others were smashed up and their tyres let down as the crowd chanted ""shame on you"".
Police said perpetrators would be ""identified and brought to justice"".
It is not clear if any arrests have been made but a spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said there would be ""significant consequences for behaviour such as this"".
Avon and Somerset Police Federation chairman Andy Roebuck said: ""This is the worst violence in Bristol for many, many years.
""It's really unprecedented violence. Between four and six or possibly more officers are seriously injured and some have broken bones.
""No-one had any indication it would erupt this way.""
Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said he recognised ""the frustrations"" with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but said that ""smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through"".
Thangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary and MP for Bristol West, added: ""The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people, including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest.""
Darren Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West, tweeted that the scenes in the city were ""completely unacceptable"".
""You don't campaign for the right to peaceful protest by setting police vans on fire or graffitiing buildings,"" he said.
Videos on Twitter showed protesters rocking and kicking a police van while officers on horseback were pushed by the crowd.
""Officers are continuing to deal with a smaller number of protesters in Bridewell Street,"" a police spokesman said earlier.
""They've had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused.
""This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice.""
Campaigners have staged a string of protests against the bill, which would give the police more powers to deal with non-violent demonstrations.
Many attendees in Bristol wore face masks and carried placards with slogans such as: ""Say no to UK police state"", ""Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy"", and ""Kill the Bill"".
Avon and Somerset Police had encouraged people to stay away from the demo and attend virtual protests instead.
Mass gatherings are currently banned under coronavirus legislation and anyone breaching regulations could be fined, though some MPs have said the law should change to allow protests.
This weekend has seen a number of protests and demonstrations, with campaigners gathering in support of various causes.

286,75,DoS attack,Chanel Miller: Stanford University scheme projects her words on to assault site,30 September 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49858238,"Students at California's Stanford University have used digital technology to show support for prominent sexual assault survivor Chanel Miller. But it comes amid unhappiness at how the university is remembering the attack.
Using augmented reality the students projected her words onto the site on campus where she was assaulted in 2015.
The area has been turned into a contemplative garden - but there was a disagreement over the choice of words for a plaque and it was never installed. Students fear this means people now don't know what the garden signifies.
The Dear Visitor exhibit saw people using iPads and headphones to see and hear the words Ms Miller wrote to attacker Brock Turner in her victim impact statement.
It was written under the pseudonym Emily Doe and went viral after being published online.
A jury found Turner, then 20, guilty of three charges: sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim, sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her. Ms Miller was found near a dumpster by two Swedish students.
Turner was given a controversially short six-month jail term, of which he served three months. He was placed on probation and remains on the sex offenders' register.
There is currently no plaque and no plans to install one after the university rejected the words Ms Miller chose to be used.
The creators of Dear Visitor - all students or former students at Stanford - wanted Friday's augmented reality project, followed by a solidarity event, to go some way towards righting that wrong.
Hope Schroeder said: ""We want to elevate Chanel Miller's voice in this space as was intended. It's not a replacement but an addition to a physical plaque.""
She said there were also fears the site was not being used as intended - with beer cans and vape cartridges found in the garden - and that its meaning could be forgotten.
The exhibit involved students being given iPads equipped with an augmented reality app to allow them to see what it would look like if a plaque had been installed in the garden.
""It gives them a window to an alternative world,"" she said. ""We were able to install digital objects that look like they're there.
""We also took the opportunity to interview students about the issue. We thought there was a risk as time goes on, students in five or 10 years could not know what the garden was about. So students' letters can be clicked on as well. We then invite people to write letters of their own.""
The Dear Visitor team contacted Ms Miller, whose memoir Know My Name was released this week, to get her go-ahead for the project.
""She liked the idea and we received her consent to use her actual voice in the space,"" added Ms Schoeder. The students also consulted sexual assault experts to make sure the experience would be ""thoughtful and informative"".
Stanford Law School professor Michele Dauber, who led the successful drive to recall Judge Aaron Persky, had also been involved in the creation of the garden.
She said the first priority had been safety, describing the dimly-lit area as a ""rape trap"". But she said that after preventing an attack happening there again, the next goal was to ""acknowledge the harm"".
Stanford had agreed to a plaque, if the words were taken from the victim impact statement. Ms Miller's first and second choices of wording were rejected by the university. They offered their own suggestions but Ms Miller did not feel they were appropriate.
One suggestion was ""I'm right here, I'm okay, everything's okay, I'm right here"" - words Ms Miller spoke to her sister after the assault - but the next paragraph explains what Ms Miller was keeping hidden, and that she was not at all OK.
Professor Dauber said: ""This young woman has been damaged enough. This was literally the least Stanford could do.
""With Chanel's book coming out, I think an appropriate reaction by Stanford would be to rethink their decision about the plaque and put it up as they promised. They broke a promise to someone who has been severely harmed.""
Student Sabrina Medler is a sexual assault survivor in her final year at Stanford who wrote about her own experiences this week, saying reading Chanel Miller's victim impact statement had empowered her.
Ms Medler said she often visits the garden and has felt ""peace"" there. She said: ""Survivors have reacted to it differently. I've always found the space comforting. When I'm there I feel a connection to Chanel Miller. It makes me feel like survivors are in this together.""
But she acknowledged it was also felt to be a reminder of the aftermath of the case, adding that Stanford had failed to do justice to Ms Miller.
She has now organised a campus petition asking for Stanford to publicly apologise for not installing a plaque with the words Ms Miller had chosen.
A Stanford University spokesman said: ""After creating the garden, we worked very hard to get agreement on a physical quote for the space, and we regret that wasn't achievable.
""The university wanted to ensure the space would provide a supportive environment for all survivors, not all of whom may have reached the same point of post-traumatic healing, and who might have a range of emotional reactions.
""We welcome this student-led initiative that offers the use of augmented reality in the space and provides visitors the agency to engage with the garden and its purpose.""
The university also said a statement made by Provost Persis Drell in March 2018 still stood, where she explained Stanford's decision. In it, she says it was felt Ms Miller's words ""expressed sentiments that would not be supportive in a healing space"".
She added that the sexual assault had ""changed our community forever"" and that Stanford was working to ""create and nurture a culture where similar events do not happen in future"".",Yes

289,78,DoS attack,Capitol riots: The hunt to identify and arrest the rioters,8 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55578092,"After the siege on the US Capitol building, the FBI is appealing to the public for help in bringing the assailants to justice. Will this approach work?
Trump supporters converged on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to express their rage over Joe Biden's victory in the election, wreaking havoc in Congress. Rioters were pictured vandalising congressional offices, and an aide to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Washington's top Democrat, reported a laptop was stolen.
Richard Barnett, a 60-year-old from Gravette, Arkansas, one of the individuals who entered the Capitol building, has been arrested, according to Justice Department officials. He was not hard to find.
He appeared in a now-iconic image of the siege: in the photo, he is sitting in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, with his feet on a desk. He has been charged with theft of public property, among other offences.
A West Virginia lawmaker, Derrick Evans, has also been charged. He posted a video of himself online, standing outside the building with Trump supporters, and then going inside the place.
Meanwhile, a man from Florida believed to be the person photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern from the House of Representatives chamber was arrested on Friday, the Miami Herald reported. Adam Christian Johnson, 36, is being held on a federal warrant at a prison in Pinellas County.
More than a dozen people have now been charged in offences related to the assault on the Capitol building, said federal law enforcement officials. More arrests are expected in the coming hours and days.
The investigation is sweeping and ambitious, and it has enlisted the help of the public.
These intruders could be charged with an array of crimes, ranging from trespassing and other relatively minor ones to serious offences involving firearms and explosive devices. They could be sentenced to many years in prison.
Which is why the FBI is now asking: do you recognise anyone in this picture?
If so, agents want to hear from you. They are conducting a massive effort to track down and arrest the people who broke into the Capitol building on Wednesday. They want everyone in the city, and across the US, to join their crime-solving team.
What's the situation so far?
The FBI has set up a tip hotline and a website, letting members of the public know how to contact them with information about the people who stormed the US Congress.
This grassroots tactic is timeworn and effective, say FBI veterans.
Posters for the FBI's ""Most Wanted Fugitives"" were once plastered on the walls of post offices, says Steven Pomerantz, a retired FBI official who previously served as head of the bureau's counterterrorism section. These kind of public-outreach programmes work well, he says.
In the mid-1990s, one of these FBI programmes led to the capture of Theodore Kaczynski, a Montana man known as the Unabomber who mailed explosives to individuals, killing three people. FBI officials decided to release to the public a manifesto that he wrote. His brother and sister-in-law recognised his ideas in the text and turned him in.
Since then, citizen-sleuths have become more sophisticated.
Activist Shaun King, known for his aggressive use of online tools to pursue criminals, went after some of the people who infiltrated the Capitol building. He posted photos of their antics, including the intruder with his feet on Nancy Pelosi's desk.
Another man pictured wearing a fur hat and horns, whose photo was shared widely online, was quickly identified as Jake Angeli - a vocal supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory - who was arrested on Saturday.
However, it takes time to sift through material offered up by members of the public, and sometimes, citizen-sleuths do more harm than good.
After the Boston bombings in 2013, online detectives circulated a photo of two people, carrying backpacks and chatting near the Boston marathon. People described them as suspects, even though they had nothing to do with the attacks.
Adding to the confusion from the Capitol attack is the proliferation of disinformation about who instigated the violence. Some Trump supporters online have already suggested the rioters were associated with Antifa or Black Lives Matter, though there is no evidence of this.
But many Americans are eager to see the mob brought to justice.
George Washington University Law Professor Stephen Saltzburg has worked in the criminal division of the US justice department, and he says people here are highly motivated to help the FBI.
""People care about democracy,"" he says. ""They want to see people punished. They want to see justice done.""",Yes
290,79,DoS attack,How do Australians respond to shark attacks?,25 January 2012,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16681464,"Three attacks in as many weeks have put sharks back on to Australia's front pages. Mercifully, the victims survived - but three maulings is about as many as this country would often see in an entire year.
Off a remote beach in Western Australia, a snorkelling guide was injured by a 10-foot (3m) tiger shark, while two surfers were savaged in separate attacks on the continent's heavily populated east coast.
Graham Nickisson, a member of the Westpac Rescue Helicopter aircrew, was dispatched to find the ""rogue shark"" - possibly a bull or juvenile great white - responsible for ripping off part of a board rider's thigh at Redhead Beach, near Newcastle, north of Sydney.
What he witnessed from the sky that day over the glittering New South Wales coast was staggering. Never before during a career spanning three decades had he seen the ocean rippling with so many sharks.
""This was quite extraordinary to actually see them so close to shore on our city beaches. I've never seen it in all my years.  It was frightening particularly being so close to swimmers. They were certainly unaware the sharks were there,"" he says.
From the air, some appeared to be up to 4m long including one of nature's most menacing creatures, the hammerhead.
""We came across a lone surfboard rider and when we had a closer look we spotted a shark in the vicinity of him.
""We thankfully got him out of the water as the shark was getting closer and closer, to within about 20ft (6m) of him. We were concerned that we were about to witness a disaster but it all turned out well.""
An abundance of baitfish, due to cleaner water and more nutrients in the ocean, is one reason why sharks could be attracted in greater numbers to the coast.
Swimmers and surfers are almost certainly accidental victims but while attacks off Australia are uncommon - figures of 20 in 2009 and 14 in 2010 were higher than normal - deaths are rare.  On average there's one fatality each year, yet news of close encounters invariably prompts Australians to wonder what is lurking out to sea.
Rodney Fox, who was almost killed by a great white shark 40 years ago, believes society is gripped by an ""irrational fear"" of these shadowy prowlers, many of which are protected in Australian waters.
""I've spent my whole life trying to get people to understand that sharks just aren't as bad as people make out,"" he says from the deck of his boat in South Australia.
He still bears the scars of a spectacular brush with death. His wounds required 468 stitches.
""This huge thump and crash hit me in the chest,"" says the 71-year-old conservationist and filmmaker.
""I stuck my fingers in its eyes and it let go. I pushed it off and grabbed the whole shark in a bear hug so it couldn't bite me and as I was holding on, I realised I was going to drown because I was 10 metres under water.""
He got to the surface but the shark followed him and swallowed his fish float, which was still attached to him, dragging him under again. Fortunately, the line snapped and he kicked for the surface, where he was rescued by the crew onboard a passing boat that had seen the sea turn red.
Australia has a huge coastline that stretches almost 50,000 kilometres and is punctuated by over 10,000 beaches, more than any other nation on Earth. The vast majority of the population - about 85% - live within 50km of the sea. It's not so much blood but salt water that courses through their veins.
More people than ever are taking to the ocean to surf, swim and sail but the chances of coming face-to-face with jaws full of flesh-tearing teeth are slim.
""There are a small number of attacks each year,"" says Dermot O'Gorman, the head of conservation group WWF-Australia. ""It's much more high-risk to drive your car than to go swimming on an Australian beach.""
A shark alert was issued at Manly beach in Sydney earlier this month but on an overcast summer's day, surfer Nick, a 22-year-old finance worker from Queensland, was eager to take to the battleship grey waters in search of a decent wave.
""You try not to think about sharks but occasionally you see a shadow in the water,"" he says.
""You see them quickly but they swim away. It's obviously a bit frightening and you lift your legs up off the board but if you're out with other surfers you take your chances. You're out there just to surf, not to worry about sharks.""
His 23-year-old friend Phil agrees.
""There's obviously a threat out there but attacks don't happen that often. It's a risk that most people are willing to take.
""For the number of people who go surfing and use the beaches in Australia, I think it's generally pretty safe most of the time.""

291,80,DoS attack,Hacker tries to poison water supply of Florida city,8 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55989843,"A computer hacker gained access to the water system of a city in Florida and tried to pump in a ""dangerous"" amount of a chemical, officials say.
The hacker briefly increased the amount of sodium hydroxide (lye) in Oldsmar's water treatment system, but a worker spotted it and reversed the action.
Lye is used in small amounts to control acidity but a large amount could have caused major problems in the water.
Oldsmar Mayor Eric Seidel said: ""There's a bad actor out there.""
No arrests have yet been made and it is not known if the hack was done from within the US or outside.
A computer controlling Oldsmar's water treatment system was remotely accessed on Friday.
A plant operator saw an attempt to access the system in the morning but assumed it was his supervisor, the Tampa Bay Times reported.
But another attempt was made early in the afternoon and this time the hacker accessed the treatment software and increased the sodium hydroxide content from 100 parts per million to 11,100 ppm.
The operator immediately reduced the level to normal.
Sodium hydroxide is the chief ingredient in liquid drain cleaners. It is very corrosive and can cause irritation to the skin and eyes, along with temporary loss of hair.
Swallowing it can cause damage to the mouth, throat and stomach and induce vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea.
Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said: ""I'm not a chemist. But I can tell you what I do know is... if you put that amount of that substance into the drinking water, it's not a good thing.""
But he added: ""At no time was there a significant adverse effect on the water being treated. Importantly, the public was never in danger.""
The Oldsmar plant provides water to businesses and about 15,000 residents.
The remote access programme to the water system has been temporarily disabled.
Analysis by Joe Tidy, cyber reporter
Imagine the horror as this worker watched their own mouse cursor being moved around the screen by an invisible hand. Then seeing it click open and adjust the electronic dials to poison the water.
Perhaps more terrifying is that this isn't the first time it's happened.
In 2016, a security report from Verizon detailed a similar attack on another unnamed US water facility. And in 2020 there were multiple unsuccessful hacks on Israeli water supplies.
This latest attack in Florida will do nothing to calm cyber-security experts who've been warning for years that so called ""critical national infrastructure"" facilities are being targeted.
Water, electricity, nuclear plants and transport are being probed for weaknesses all the time not just because of the potential for mass disruption but also because they are often running on out-of-date and vulnerable IT systems.
So far all attacks on water supplies have been averted.
But as Mayor Seidel put it in his press conference, this is an event that ""puts everyone on notice: these types of bad actors are out there and this is happening"".",Yes

293,82,DoS attack,Italian ambassador to DR Congo killed in UN convoy attack,22 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56151600,"Italy's ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo has been killed in an attack in the east of the country, its foreign ministry has said.
Luca Attanasio, 43, died in hospital on Monday after the United Nations convoy he was travelling in came under fire near Goma, a statement said.
The convoy reportedly belonged to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).
An Italian military police officer travelling with the envoy and a Congolese driver were also killed.
""It is with deep sadness that the foreign ministry confirms the death, today in Goma, of the Italian ambassador,"" the ministry's statement said.
The attack in North Kivu province is believed to have been an attempted kidnapping, according to officials at the nearby Virunga National Park.
Mr Attanasio was a passenger in one of two vehicles travelling about 15km (nine miles) north of Goma when the attack happened on Monday morning.
The vehicles were ""ambushed by a group of six attackers, who fired warning shots before taking all the passengers into the Virunga National Park"", the governor of North Kivu province, Carly Nzanzu, told the BBC.
""That's when a patrol of Virunga National Park rangers intervened and managed to free four people,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, before they ran away, the assailants shot the ambassador and his bodyguard, and they killed the Congolese driver at the start of the attack,"" the governor added.
The WFP said Mr Attanasio was travelling from Goma to visit a ""schools programme"" in the village of Rutshuru in eastern DR Congo.
""The attack... occurred on a road that had previously been cleared for travel without security escorts,"" the Rome-based agency said in a statement.
The two other fatalities were military police officer Vittorio Iacovacci, 30, who had been serving at the embassy since last September, and their Congolese driver, who has been named as Moustapha Milambo in media reports.
A number of other passengers were reportedly injured.
It is not clear who was behind the attack, but the interior ministry has accused a Hutu rebel group known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).
Many armed groups are known to operate in and around the park and militias clash regularly in the east of the country, where a large UN force is struggling to keep the peace.
The DRC army has deployed troops to help search the area.
Analysis by Emery Makumeno, BBC News, Kinshasa
Mr Attanasio is the first ambassador to be killed in the country since French ambassador Philippe Bernard was shot dead during riots in the capital, Kinshasa, in 1997.
Normally, aid convoys travelling in eastern DR Congo are heavily guarded by UN troops, and questions are bound to be asked about the level of security that Mr Attanasio's convoy had.
He was travelling in the east - the most unstable part of DR Congo. Many local armed groups - as well as those from Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Uganda - have established themselves in the region over the last 25 years.
The attack highlights the fact that stability to the region will return only if a solution is found to political issues in all these countries.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi issued a statement offering his ""deepest condolences"", while President Sergio Mattarella condemned the ""cowardly attack"".
Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed his ""great shock and immense sorrow"" at the ""brutal"" killings.
""Today Italy mourns the loss of two of its sons and embraces their families,"" he said, adding: ""No effort will be spared to shed light on what happened.""
DR Congo's Foreign Minister, Marie Tumba Nzeza, said an investigation into the killings was under way.
Mr Attanasio had represented Italy in the DR Congo since 2017. He joined the diplomatic service in 2003 and spent time in Morocco and Nigeria.
DR Congo was for many years at the centre of a brutal civil war that drew in several neighbouring countries.
The conflict led to the loss of some five million lives between 1994 and 2003, with some observers branding it Africa's Great War.
But the end of the conflict did not mark an end to the violence. Dozens of militias and rebel groups continue to operate in eastern areas.
The UN's peacekeeping mission has been in DR Congo since 1999. It is one of the biggest peacekeeping operations in the world, with more than 17,000 personnel on the ground.
Virunga - which stretches across 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) - is one of the most dangerous parks on the continent.
In 2018, a ranger was killed and three people - including two British tourists - were kidnapped when their vehicle was ambushed in the Virunga National Park. Those kidnapped were later released.",Yes
294,83,DoS attack,"Boy, 16, who left Leicestershire PC's nose 'hanging off' sentenced",12 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-55625061,"A teenage boy who punched a police constable, leaving her nose ""hanging off"", has been sentenced.
PC Maddie Hayes required 17 stitches after the attack in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, on 12 September.
PC Hayes, 24, said she felt ""unbelievable pain"" after trying to handcuff the teenager.
The 16-year-old, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, was given a 12-month community order and told to pay Â£600 compensation.
PC Hayes, of Leicestershire Police, was assisting with the search of the boy after he had been detained by officers.
She said she placed a handcuff around one of the boy's wrists, but he then used his free hand to punch her.
Police said PC Hayes needed emergency surgery after sustaining a broken nose and septum, a tear on the left side of her nose as well as swelling and bruising.
PC Hayes said her nose was ""hanging off"" due to the way she had been struck.
She also has exposed cartilage in her nostrils as a result of the injuries, the force added.
PC Hayes was forced to take sick leave from work for three months and is awaiting further surgery as the injuries have left her struggling to breathe properly through her nose.
She told the BBC the attack has made her ""more determined"" to help people.
Insp Rich Jackson, police commander for north west Leicestershire, said: ""This was a shocking and vicious attack on an officer doing her job to protect others.
""The photographs of our officer's awful injuries chilled all who saw them.
""Attacks on police officers are simply not acceptable. We must protect our protectors.""
The boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - admitted wounding a police constable in December.
He was sentenced at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Monday.

295,84,DoS attack,Kill the Bill Bristol protest: More arrests expected,22 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-56461796,"Police are scouring an ""enormous amount"" of footage and have vowed to make more arrests after violence at a Kill the Bill protest in Bristol.
Protesters clashed with officers as thousands turned out for the march on Sunday.
Eight people have already been arrested after 21 officers were injured.
Avon and Somerset Police said the investigation could result in the largest number of images for wanted suspects in the force's history.
Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel accused some protesters of ""thuggery"" and Bristol's mayor said those involved in the violence were ""selfish"".
One of the injured officers suffered a punctured lung, with the chairman of the local Police Federation saying the actions of some were ""close to attempted murder"".
Of the eight people arrested so far, six were detained for violent disorder and two for possession of an offensive weapon.
Det Ch Supt Carolyn Belafonte said CCTV footage, body-worn camera videos and social media coverage were being studied along with photographs.
A dedicated page has also been set up on the Avon and Somerset Police website for people to send footage and pictures in.
""From what we've already obtained, we're confident more arrests are imminent,"" said Det Ch Supt Belafonte.
She said forensic evidence, including fingerprints, had been recovered from the scene.
""To those who took part in this spree of offending, you can expect a knock at your door in the days or weeks to come - it may come sooner than you think,"" she added
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people had a right to protest but the violent scenes were ""unacceptable"".
He added: ""They should protest peacefully and legally.""
Speaking in the House of Commons earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the protests as ""anarchic"" and ""violent"".
She said the minority of people who confronted police officers in the city centre on Sunday night had demonstrated ""criminal thuggery and disorder"" that put lives at risk.
""Our exceptional and brave police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect the public.
""For them to face the criminal violence against them while upholding the law is completely unacceptable,"" she added.
""My thoughts are with the injured officers and their family.""
Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees slammed offenders as ""selfish"" for ""living out their revolutionary fantasies"".
Avon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Andy Marsh said the protest had been ""hijacked by extremists"", by ""people who were determined to commit criminal damage"".
Mr Marsh said: ""There was a hardcore of serious criminals hidden within those 3,000 people - perhaps 400 or 500 people - and we certainly didn't trigger this.""
Crowds had gathered to peacefully protest in opposition to the new Police and Crime Bill but it went in a ""violent direction"" outside Bridewell Police Station at about 17:30 GMT, Mr Marsh said.
As angry scenes unfolded, demonstrators scaled the station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls.
Mr Marsh said that while it would not have been ""practical or possible"" to arrest more people on the night, those involved in the violence can expect ""very serious consequences"".
""We will be asking for the people of Bristol to identify these thuggish citizens so we can bring them to justice,"" he added.
By 17:30 there were approximately 300 police officers at the scene.
Two officers were injured and treated in hospital, with one suffering a punctured lung and broken ribs, and the other a fractured arm. Both have since been discharged.
Twelve police vehicles were also damaged, with two set on fire. It is understood the police operation cost around Â£1m.
Andy Roebuck, chairman of Avon and Somerset Police Federation said: ""We had them actually squirting liquid on our visors.
""They've turned up with weapons and then tried to set fire to a police vehicle with police officers actually inside it.
""That is close to attempted murder of those police officers as far as we are concerned in the Police Federation.
""That is the level of violence and determination that these animals have gone to. And this is something we can not tolerate.""
At times there were as few as 50 police officers, facing 100 or more violent protesters.
Horses and dogs were used to great effect, but their numbers have been cut in the last decade.
This means that arguably, the police were outnumbered.  To arrest one protester during the pandemic, it currently takes an average of three officers and one vehicle, since suspects have to be kept socially distanced.
However, public order commanders know that sending in snatch squads to make arrests also leads to a more violent response.
So, instead of clearing the streets, and making arrests, a decision was taken for police to hold their ground, and gather evidence for later investigations.
The result has given a dangerous impression.  A feeling of a loss of control which was also a feature of the early stages of the 2011 riots in England.
Workers from Bristol Waste spent the morning removing broken glass, debris and offensive graffiti from the streets.
Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said the violence had made people already dealing with inequality in the city less safe and questioned whether the perpetrators were from Bristol or were ""protest tourists"".
He said: ""Smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through.
""On the contrary, the lawlessness on show will be used as evidence and promote the need for the bill.
""This is a shameful day in an incredible year for Bristol. These people should feel shame.""
Sue Mountstevens, Avon and Somerset's police and crime commissioner, said the behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"".
She said: ""It's disgraceful these men and women who started their days expecting a normal day of policing have all returned battered and bruised.
""These people have shown reckless disregard of the lives and safety of our communities in central Bristol and our officers.
""Whether you agree or disagree with the bill, these men and women did not deserve to face the level of violence directed at them. Nothing can justify such actions.""
University student Rhianna Prewitt, who attended the demonstration, said: ""This is a symptom of not allowing organisers to actually properly organise protests and, by doing that, extremists and people who are looking for a riot are going to take advantage to cause chaos.
""Also, if the government doesn't want us to protest during the pandemic, why are they pushing through a significant law at this time without public scrutiny?""
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the disorder was ""inexcusable"" and those involved should be identified and ""prosecuted where appropriate.""
He condemned the ""lawlessness"" by people who were ""intent on violence,"" adding parallels could not be drawn between the protests in London against harassment and violence against women and the scenes in Bristol.",Yes
296,85,DoS attack,Labour MP 'taken aback by extent and severity' of abuse,10 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-55981061,"An MP has said she is ""horrified"" by the ""extent and severity"" of anti-Semitic and homophobic abuse she has received since being elected.
Labour's Charlotte Nichols said she had been increasingly targeted since winning her Warrington North seat at the 2019 general election.
Earlier this month, she shared a tweet from a Tory candidate for the town's council which used Nazi terminology.
The Conservatives said the woman had been suspended from the party.
Ms Nichols, who was promoted to shadow women and equalities minister in November, spoke out after sharing a screenshot of a Twitter exchange from February 2020 with Sharon Thomason, who was later selected as a council candidate by the Conservatives.
She had replied to a post from Ms Nichols, making reference to ""the Aryan race"", a term used by Nazis to refer to a group of people they believed to be superior to other races.
Ms Nichols' sharing of the exchange on 3 February prompted Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner to say she was ""horrified that someone who has publicly promoted these views has been selected as a Conservative Party candidate"".
Since being shown the tweet, the Conservatives said Ms Thomason had been ""suspended from the party and is no longer a member"".
""Ms Thomason will no longer be standing as a Conservative candidate in the local elections.""
Cheshire Police confirmed it was investigating the posts after receiving a third-party report of an offensive social media message.
In a letter to Ms Nichols, the Tory co-chairman Amanda Milling MP apologised and stated that the party's complaints team was ""looking into all allegations against Warrington Conservatives"".
Ms Nichols said the level of abuse she had faced online and in post since becoming an MP was so large, she had had to put ""things in place that mean that I don't see the majority of what I get sent"".
She said while there was an argument to say ""a level of abuse in public life is the price we have to pay for doing the job that we do"", she had been shocked by attacks on her loved ones.
""Dad didn't sign up to that, my ex didn't sign up to it, my sisters didn't sign up to it,"" she said.
""So when they get sent stuff or are talked about by people as a way of getting at me, that's the bit that really hurts because they didn't sign up to this life; I did.
""I think people on all sides of the political spectrum can be guilty of forgetting that MPs are human beings with the same sort of feelings, struggles and aspirations as anyone else.""
She said the abuse had led to her having ""a panic button in every room"" of her house.
""I feel generally safe while out, but reading in black and white that your front door could be easily forced and they are going to give you a new one is shocking.
""You wouldn't normally even think about someone setting fire to your door as a risk that you have to mitigate against.""

297,86,DoS attack,Manchester Arena Inquiry: Policing issues 'identified before attack',8 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-55981337,"Police were told of shortcomings in a terror response plan months before the Manchester Arena attack, an inquiry has heard.
The police inspectorate warned in November 2016 that ""an over-reliance"" on the officer in charge of the response could see them overwhelmed.
Policing experts believe that is what happened after the May 2017 attack.
A former inspector told the inquiry Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was urged to ""raise its game"" at the time.
The public inquiry into the atrocity, which killed 22 people as they left an Ariana Grande concert, has been hearing about inspections of GMP around the time of the attack.
It has previously heard only one paramedic was in the City Room foyer, where bomber Salman Abedi detonated his device, for the first 40 minutes after the blast and the first fire engine arrived more than two hours after the explosion.
Andrew Buchan, who worked as an inspector with HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, said it was identified in 2016 that GMP's plan was ""very tactically focused"".
But he said it did not go into detail about working with other agencies and had placed ""an over-reliance"" on the ""force duty inspector (FDO) to lead their response to a terrorist attack"".
The inspectorate's report said the number of tasks the officer would be ""expected to perform in all likelihood are so many that it may be some will not be completed or at least in the order expected"", the inquiry heard.
It said the force had acknowledged that the pressures the officer would be placed under would ""bring its own challenges"", but the matter was left unresolved.
It added that ""such apparent vagueness may cause confusion or doubt in a live scenario"" and there was a need ""to provide the FDO with more immediate support or resources to assist with all the functions expected of that role"".
Mr Buchan said the watchdog spoke to four duty inspectors at GMP, who said they had received no counter-terrorism training and ""felt ill prepared for that eventuality"" but would draw on the experience of other critical incidents.
The inquiry heard unarmed officers, who were likely to be the first on the scene, were said to be unaware of GMP's counter-terrorism plans and did not know where to find them.
It was told that none of the officers who spoke to the watchdog knew exactly what they would have to do in the event of a terrorist incident.
The inquiry heard staff in GMP's control room had received no specific training to help them do their job during a terror attack.
Mr Buchan said the force had been told it ""needed to raise its game"" in testing and training control room and unarmed staff before ""the awful time when a terrorist attack actually happens"".
He said that in November 2016, he personally spoke to a senior GMP officer to share the shortcomings found in their inspection report, which he added were issues found in other forces throughout England and Wales.
The final report into UK counter-terrorism policing was never publically published due to national security reasons.
The inquiry continues.

298,87,DoS attack,Gabrielle Friel: Terror accused 'idolised' Californian spree killer,14 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-55302122,"A man accused of terrorism offences felt like the founding father of the incel (involuntary celibate) ideology and idolised him.
A jury was told Gabrielle Friel knew of Elliot Rodger and the acts of violence he carried out, had sourced weapons and was planning an attack.
But in his closing speech, defence solicitor advocate Brian Gilfedder argued Mr Friel should be acquitted.
Mr Friel, 22, denies intending to commit acts of terrorism.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Richard Goddard QC reminded jurors of Mr Friel's words to a social worker on 14 August last year when he said: ""I feel like I am Elliot Rodger who was a killer in a school.""
Mr Goddard said Sarah Drummond had noted he was very fixated and almost idolised Californian spree killer Rodger.
The advocate depute said that two days later Mr Friel told psychiatrist Dr Alexander Quinn: ""I do want to carry out a mass shooting.""
He said: ""We know when he spoke all those words he had already ordered and taken possession of a crossbow with telescopic sights.""
Mr Goddard told the jury: ""We know Gabrielle Friel had embraced incel ideology, fixated on it.""
The prosecutor said there was ""a host of incriminating circumstances"" which amounted to a convincing case against Mr Friel and called on a jury to convict him of two offences under the Terrorism Act which he faces.
Mr Goddard said the social worker reported Mr Friel as feeling a lot of anger and being unfairly treated in life.
She said he felt rejected and jealous of what others had and felt females were not interested in him. Mr Goddard said jurors might think all of these were incel-related themes.
Mr Friel had told her he felt like Rodger and was able to tell her about his YouTube video and manifesto.
The prosecutor said that Dr Quinn, who saw Mr Friel two days after his meeting with the social worker, said he was very angry with the world and was displaying anger towards women. He felt girls and women had never been interested in him.
He said to the psychiatrist: ""If I do plan an attack it will be real. I do want to cause a mass shooting.""
Mr Goddard said Mr Friel had already sourced a high-powered crossbow and a foot-long machete and was looking for the means to carry them into a public place.
The prosecutor said he had also made ""visit after visit after visit"" to online retailers of firearms.
Mr Friel, from Edinburgh, is accused of possessing a crossbow, scope, 15 bolts, a machete and a ballistic vest between 1 June and 16 August last year in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that it was for a purpose connected with ""the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism"" in Edinburgh.
He is also accused of, with the intention of committing acts of terrorism, conducting online research in an attempt to acquire a firearm, in relation of spree killing mass murder and  expressing a desire to commit such a murder. He denies the charges.
Defence solicitor advocate Brian Gilfedder argued that Mr Friel should be cleared of the charges he faces.
He said: ""This case has nothing to do with terrorism, nothing to do with advancing an ideology, an incel-related ideology.
""My submission is this case is all about the accused wanting to achieve death by extended suicide - to provoke the police to shoot him. That was his purpose, that was his intention.""
Mr Gilfedder argued that one of the three key factors for a terrorism conviction was that it was committed for the purpose of of advancing a political, racial, religious or ideological cause.
He said with Mr Friel the alleged basis was that of the incel ideology but maintained that Crown ""fell down"" on that factor.
The jury will return to consider its deliberations on Tuesday.",Yes
299,88,DoS attack,Victims of crimes 're-traumatised' by system,9 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55986198,"When Tracey Hanson's son, Josh, was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack in 2015, it was the start of a tough journey through the criminal justice system.
She said she was ""passed from pillar to post"" throughout and the impact stays with her today.
Experiences like hers - and others who have been victims of crime - is driving a fresh call from Labour for a ""Victims' Law"" to strengthen their rights.
Labour's shadow victims minister, Peter Kyle, said for ""too long"", those who suffer have been ""forgotten and squeezed out"" by the system.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice said a new version of the Victims' Code, coming into force in April, will ""boost the rights of victims at every stage of the justice process"", and legislation will follow ""later this year"".
Josh was 21 when he was stabbed in a bar in London, which led to what his mum described as a ""re-traumatising"" experience with the criminal justice system where ""you suffer unnecessarily over and over again"".
She said: ""You're turning to the very resources that you've always believed, as a citizen, are there for you to help you at your time of need.
""When you're desperately in need of that help and support, and it's not forthcoming. Honestly, it's just absolutely horrific. I can't tell you the number of experiences I've had, but some are just inhumane.""
One incident that has stayed with Tracey happened just days after her son's death, when she went to see him in the mortuary.
At this traumatising time, she was asked to sign forms deciding what to do with cells and tissue from his body.
""I was asked to sign that on the day that I was seeing my son in a mortuary for the first time, seeing my son's body laid out,"" she said.
""Imagine that. I mean, I would have signed my house away, I would have signed anything.
""I had no recollection of that experience until three-and-a-half years later when I started to think about getting Josh's clothes.""
Tracey said she was then told by email that she had signed the forms and his tissue had been destroyed. She had also not been given her own copy of the document.
""The mortuary keeps a copy, the coroner, the police keep a copy, but you as a victim, who has signed an extremely important document, you're not even given a copy because there isn't one for you,"" she said.
""Where's the victim's rights in that?""
Tracey now helps other victims of crime, alongside campaigning for a change in the law on unduly lenient sentences, as she knows her experience is far from unique.
All victims of crime have a set of rights set out in the Victims' Code, which includes a right to information and the right to make a victim impact statement.
But the Crime Survey of England and Wales found that in 2017-18, only one-in-five victims had heard of it.
The code has recently been updated and the new version comes into effect on 1 April 2021.
But despite successive Conservative governments pledging to enshrine the rights into law since 2015, legislation has yet to be put to Parliament.
Labour's Mr Kyle is increasing the pressure by introducing his own Victims' Bill to Parliament, saying putting the code on a legal footing is the ""baseline"" - with any law needing to go much further.
He said that ""too often... there is no link between the victim and the system"", which can lead to cases failing, and while it was not the fault of individuals working for criminal justice, it must be addressed.
""We have a system that, unfortunately, has focused so much on their part in bringing people to justice that it's forgotten and squeezed out the victims themselves,"" said the Labour MP.
""I think that our criminal justice system will never be able to deliver the justice that's deserved, and make sure that victims feel that justice has been done for them, unless we can reconnect victims to the criminal justice system itself. ""
Mr Kyle said his bill would introduce ""consequences"" into the system to make victims' rights ""un-ignorable"".
The Conservatives promised again in their manifesto at the 2019 election to introduce a Victims' Law.
But Vera Baird QC, the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, said the need for a law ""really gets more urgent as time goes by"".
She said there had been ""a significant fall in confidence about the criminal justice system from victims"", and she saw the results in her office ""day to day"".
Ms Baird added: ""We urgently need victims' rights to be put into law.
""They are not hard to do and they don't attack the defendant's rights in any way, but a Victims' Law is now critically urgent.""
Asked about Labour's push for the law, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ""Our new Victims' Code boosts the rights of victims at every stage of the justice process and we will strengthen these further by consulting on legislation later this year.
""We are also investing millions in vital support services while recruiting 20,000 more police officers to build back confidence in the justice system.""

301,90,DoS attack,Web attack blogger blames Russia,7 August 2009,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8190786.stm,"A blogger who was targeted in a co-ordinated attack against websites such as Facebook and Twitter has told the BBC he blames Russia for the assault.The pro-Georgian blogger, known as Cyxymu, said he had been targeted for ""telling the truth about the Russian-Georgian war"" in his writings. The attack caused a blackout of Twitter for about two hours on Thursday. Despite the blogger's claims, security researchers say there is ""no suggestion the attack was state-endorsed"". Google, Facebook and blogging platform Live Journal - all sites where Cyxymu had accounts - were also affected. ""I write the truth about the Russian-Georgian war and somebody did not like these truths - these people in Russia,"" the blogger told BBC News. ""I don't know which people,"" he added. The blogger, real name Georgy, has posted videos and blogs which criticise Russia over its conduct in the war over the South Ossetia region, which began one year ago. ""It's a big surprise to me that my blog has meant that 250m people have not been able to enter Facebook,"" he said. Graham Cluley, of security firm Sophos, told BBC News there was no suggestion the attack against the blogger was state-endorsed. ""It was almost certainly an individual who took objection to his blogs,"" he said. ""They took internet vigilantism into their own hands to try to blast him off the web, but in the process blasted Twitter off instead."" 'Fragile service'Facebook had previously confirmed to BBC News that the attacks were directed at an individual who had ""a presence on a number of sites, rather than the sites themselves"". ""A botnet was directed to request his pages at such a rate that it impacted service for other users,"" the spokesperson said.

""This activity is about saturating a service with so many requests that it cannot respond to legitimate requests thereby denying service to intended customers or users."" The blogger said he first noticed that things were not right when he realised his Live Journal page was not working. ""After, I entered Facebook to say Live Journal was not working and Facebook was down,"" he told BBC News. ""So I entered Twitter to say that Live Journal and Facebook were not working, and Twitter was down. ""And so I understood that it was under attack. It is not possible that these three services were all down at one time."" He told the BBC that he still did not have access to his blog or profile pages on any of the services. However, he said, he had set up a new blog to continue his writings.

303,92,DoS attack,"Who, what, why: What should you do if a grizzly attacks?",7 July 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-14065432,"An American man has been killed by a grizzly bear while he and his wife were taking a hike in the famed Yellowstone National Park. Bear attacks are often fatal - so what can you do to protect yourself?
The couple were said to have surprised the bear while she was with her cubs. The woman - who ran before dropping to the ground - survived the attack after the bear picked her up by her backpack, but then left her alone.
While it is not an exact science, most experts say that, in the case of a bear acting in defence, the best response is to either back away slowly, or lie down on the ground and play dead.
Nearly all say prevention is better than cure - the best advice may be to give bears a wide berth.
If you are not familiar with the area, ask locals where bears are most commonly found, and plan your route accordingly, advises Ted Oakes, producer of the BBC's The Bear Family and Me.
""It's really important to not surprise them,"" Mr Oakes says, so attach bells to your hiking gear and make noise so the animals know you are there.
If you are camping, keep food away from the tents, as bears are omnivores and will scavenge for whatever is available. He recommends putting edible goods in a sealable bag and hanging them on a tree about 100 yards fom the campsite.
Hikers can also find safety in numbers, he says.
Grizzly bears - a subspecies of the brown bear - can weigh up to 1,500 pounds (680kg) and can run at up to 35mph (55 km/h), according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
They do not attack humans regularly, and will tend to only do so if they are defending their young and are startled, or if hunters surprise them when they are feeding on a carcass.
If you do come across one, then walk away slowly, and avoid the temptation to run, Mr Oakes says.
Dr Lynn Rogers, founder of the North American Bear Center, offers slightly different advice.
If a bear is with cubs then it is a good idea to play dead and clasp your hands around your head at the back of the neck, he says.
The aim is to be as non-threatening as possible.
He says that grizzlies - in contrast to black bears - evolved in more open landscapes and therefore developed more aggressive tendencies.
""With a black bear, it doesn't make much difference [how you respond]. They're not out to get you. It's one in a million that wants to kill you,"" he says.
While fear of an attack should not mar enjoyment of the beautiful scenery, it is worth being prepared, such as by carrying pepper spray, Dr Rogers says.
""Pepper spray is easier to carry and much easier to aim than a gun,"" he argues.
And Mr Oakes agrees that such attacks are very rare so it's not worth letting it spoil your trip. ""Driving to the park leads to more fatalities than bear attacks.""
The latest incident was the first such killing in the park in nearly 25 years, according to officials at Yellowstone.",Yes

Fra McCaffrey was driving to Larne, County Antrim, at about 22:30 GMT on 8 January when the bin was thrown at his lorry.
He has since had two operations to remove shattered windscreen glass from his eyes.
Now he faces ""a long road"" to recovery, his son Dan said.
""I'm sure he is acting strong, that he is being a dad, being strong and putting on a brave face but deep down you can tell it is definitely hurting him,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.
""More or less, he has been basically told it is very, very likely his eyesight is gone.
""They can't say 100% it's definitely gone, but they've basically told him he will never drive lorries or HGVS again.""
Mr McCaffrey, 56, had been driving under the Ballyboley overpass when the bin was thrown at his lorry.
Its windscreen shattered upon impact.
On a ""positive"" note, his son says his left eye is unharmed.
Mr McCaffrey gave up taxi driving to drive lorries when the coronavirus pandemic broke out.
His son said he is ""not the type of guy to sit about waiting for things to happen"".
The McCaffrey family are now struggling to come to terms with the attack.
Dan said his mother is ""being strong for us, the kids, but she is devastated, hurt and sad"".
That his dad should be attacked while out doing his job is difficult to comprehend, he added.
""Everybody I have spoken to seems lost for words, there are no words,"" he said.
""They can't think why or how you would even go about an act like this. It's mind-blowing.""
The bin thrown at his lorry, Dan added, was not filled with ""stones or bricks""  but ""actual rocks"".
He is convinced the attack was planned.
""Just based on where it is, it seems very unlikely someone would walk a wheelie bin to that point,"" he said.
""It almost seems like it has been taken from somewhere and brought to there in some form of transport, it's been transferred there.""
Dan said ""amazingly"" his dad had somehow managed to bring the lorry to a halt on the roadside and flag down help.
""He managed to be able to see something like a light coming that he sort of waved down,"" he said.
A young passing driver came to his aid and raised the alarm.
Mr McCaffrey has been praised by police for ""miraculously"" bringing the lorry to a stop following the moment of impact.

He said attempted murder ""is one of those charges we are considering"".

308,97,DoS attack,Vienna shooting: Gunman hunted after deadly 'terror' attack,3 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54786952,"Gunmen armed with rifles have opened fire in six different locations in central Vienna, killing three people and wounding several more, police say.
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called it a ""repulsive terror attack"" and said one gunman was also killed.
Police were searching for at least one attacker who was still at large, the interior minister said.
The shootings took place near Vienna's central synagogue but it is not yet clear if that was the target.
The city's police chief said two men and a woman were killed. At least a dozen other people were wounded, officials said.
The attack happened just hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were out enjoying bars and restaurants which are now closed until the end of November.
European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"".
Police said the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants.
Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman suffered a gunshot wound before other officers shot the perpetrator, who was armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete.
Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch tweeted that the synagogue was closed at the time the attack began.
An officer guarding the synagogue was among the wounded, newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported.
It was not immediately clear how many attackers took part in the shooting. Austrian media said one person had been arrested, citing the interior ministry.
Footage posted on social media showed people running through the streets as gunshots rang out.
Witness Chris Zhao was in a nearby restaurant when the shooting started.
He told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. We saw the ambulances... lining up. There were victims. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us.""
As a major anti-terror operation swung into action, police urged people to avoid the area and not to use public transport. Roadblocks were set up around the city centre.
Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they were carrying out random checks on the border with Austria amid fears that the gunman might head in that direction.
Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the attacker still at large was ""heavily armed and dangerous"".
He told a news conference that children in Vienna would not be expected to attend school on Tuesday.
On Twitter, Mr Kurz said ""we are experiencing difficult hours in our republic"", adding that the army would take over the security of major buildings in Vienna.
""Our police will act decisively against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism,"" he said.
Austria had until now been spared the sort of attacks that have hit other European countries. Leaders across the region condemned the shooting, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks.
""We the French people share the shock and grief of the Austrian people, struck this evening by an attack in the heart of their capital, Vienna. After France, a friend of ours is attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with,"" he said.
Three people died in a knife attack in a church in the French city of Nice last week in what Mr Macron said was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"".
The UK prime minister also said the country's ""thoughts are with the people of Austria - we stand united with you against terror"" while Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we stand ready to support in any way we can"".
European Council President Charles Michel called it a cowardly act that violated life and human values.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the shooting ""a heinous act"" and expressed ""solidarity"" with Austria.",Yes

310,99,DoS attack,CES 2021: Microsoft's Brad Smith slams SolarWinds 'indiscriminate assault',13 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55649488,"Microsoft's president has called the SolarWinds hack an ""mass indiscriminate global assault"" that should be a wake-up call to cyber-defenders.
Brad Smith was making a keynote speech at the CES technology trade show.
Earlier, it emerged President-elect Joe Biden had created a new post for a former National Security Agency official to help determine the US response to the attack.
Anne Neuberger had specialised in operations against Russia.
Plans to appoint her to the role of deputy national security adviser for cyber-security within the National Security Council were first reported by Politico and have now been confirmed by the New York Times.
The NYT said she had run the NSA's Russia Small Group, responsible for a pre-emptive strike on Kremlin operatives in 2018.
She is currently head of the agency's Cybersecurity Directorate.
US intelligence agencies believe Russia was behind the SolarWinds attack, which compromised email accounts at the US Department of Justice as well as giving the perpetrators access to the systems of government agencies, businesses and other organisations worldwide.
The full extent of the attack has yet to emerge.
The Kremlin has denied involvement.
SolarWinds sells a widely used network monitoring tool that was altered to provide the hackers with a backdoor.
Microsoft was among the victims and has confirmed some of its source code - the normally inaccessible instructions behind its software - had been accessed.
""Governments have spied on each other for centuries, it would be naive to think or even ask them to stop,"" said Mr Smith in his keynote.
""But we've long lived in a world where there were norms and rules that created expectations about what was appropriate and what was not.
""And what happened with SolarWinds was not.
""Why? Because this wasn't a case of one nation simply trying to spy on or hack its way into a computer network of another.
""It was a mass indiscriminate global assault on the technology supply chain that all of us are responsible for protecting.
""It is a danger that the world cannot afford.""
Security experts needed to learn one of the lessons of the 11 September 2001 terror attacks, which had exposed how different US government agencies had failed to share threat information, Mr Smith said.
""We need to move, as the 9/11 Commission said, from a culture where people only gave others information when they had a need to know,"" he said.
""And in the words of that commission, change the culture so that people feel a need to share.""
Mr Smith also said there was a greater need to work together to tackle attacks linked to the Covid crisis.
""We have lived through the biggest pandemic in a century,"" he said.
""And what did some people use that pandemic to do?
""To launch cyber-attacks against hospitals, against the public health sector, against the World Health Organization, against the first line of critical responders.
""This too should be off limits.""
Ms Neuberger will now be responsible for trying to persuade US agencies and the country's wider cyber-security sector to work together against such threats.
In her previous role, she coordinated the response of US government agencies to a flaw her team discovered suspected Russian hackers were using.
""It was really great to see five different cyber-security entities using that to identify other Russian intelligence infrastructure and then take that down,"" she told CBS News in August.
Last month, Mr Biden said once the extent of the damage the SolarWinds hack had caused was better known, the US would probably ""respond in kind"".
There will be many in the cyber-security industry who nodded along enthusiastically with Brad Smith.
The SolarWinds hack has stunned and terrified the sector - particularly those who make and sell software to protect us from hacks.
The last few weeks have been a nightmare scenario playing out in slow motion as more and more details of the scope and depth of the intrusion have been drip-fed to the public.
For the intelligence community though, at least in private, it's more of a case of: ""Why didn't we think of that?""
All nations hack each other and supply chain attacks like this  -albeit not as successful - have been used in the past for spying or disruption.
Clearly the Biden administration is preparing to respond in some way. But in truth, aside from perhaps a public naming and shaming of the hackers, there is little it can do directly to the perpetrators involved.
What happens behind closed doors is far more significant as cyber-defences will need to be rebuilt and potential offensive retaliation planned.",Yes
311,100,DoS attack,Ticketmaster fined Â£1.25m over payment data breach,13 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54931873,"Ticketmaster UK has been fined Â£1.25m for failing to keep its customers' personal data secure.
The fine was issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) following a cyber-attack on the Ticketmaster website in 2018.
The ICO said personal information and payment details had potentially been stolen from more than nine million customers in Europe.
Ticketmaster said it would appeal against the ruling.
An investigation found a vulnerability in a third-party chatbot built by Inbenta Technologies, which Ticketmaster had installed on its online payments page.
A cyber-attacker was able to use the chatbot to access customer payment details.
Following the breach, 60,000 Barclays bank customers were victims of fraud. Online bank Monzo had to replace 6,000 payment cards due to fraud.
The ICO said Monzo, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Barclaycard, Mastercard and American Express had all warned Ticketmaster of suspected fraud.
But Ticketmaster took nine weeks to start monitoring activity on its payments page, according to the ICO.
""Ticketmaster should have done more to reduce the risk of a cyber-attack. Its failure to do so meant that millions of people in the UK and Europe were exposed to potential fraud,"" said James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner at the ICO.
In a statement, Ticketmaster said: ""Ticketmaster takes fans' data privacy and trust very seriously.
""Since Inbenta Technologies was breached in 2018, we have offered our full cooperation to the ICO. We plan to appeal [against] today's announcement.""
Law firm Keller Lenkner said it was pursuing legal action against Ticketmaster on behalf of thousands of fraud victims.
""While several banks tried to alert Ticketmaster of potential fraud, it took an unacceptable nine weeks for action to be taken, exposing an estimated 1.5 million UK customers,"" said Kingsley Hayes, the firm's head of cyber-crime.",Yes
312,1,malware,Apple users targeted by 'mysterious' malware,23 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56172400,"About 30,000 Mac devices have been infected with a mysterious piece of malware.
The ""unusual"" Silver Sparrow strain silently affected systems in more than 150 countries around the world.
It was discovered by researchers at security company Red Canary, who have yet to determine its purpose.
Apple says it has taken steps to restrict the potential damage the malware, which targets devices with its new M1 chip, could cause.
Its actions effectively prevent any new devices from being infected.
BBC News has asked Apple to clarify how existing users can tell if they are affected.
Researchers said Silver Sparrow ""did not exhibit the behaviours that weâve come to expect from the usual adware that so often targets macOS systems"".
It appears to call a command-and-control server every hour, from an infected machine, to check for ""further instructions"".
It also has a system in place to self-destruct and hide its existence entirely.
""Though we havenât observed Silver Sparrow delivering additional malicious payloads yet, its global reach, relatively high infection rate, and operational maturity suggest Silver Sparrow is a reasonably serious threat, uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a momentâs notice,â the researchers said.
Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, told BBC News the attack should be a wake-up call to Mac users who assumed they were not at the same risk as Windows users of being infected by malware.
""The malware doesnât appear to have done anything nasty,"" she said.
""But the fact it spread so fast and infected so many devices is alarming in itself.
""No device is immune from viruses.""
Computer security expert Alan Woodward said the attack appeared to be an effort to disprove this long-standing myth.
""It is as if someone was trying a proof of concept of how to move harmful code on to Macs and to control it once there,"" he said.
""But they didnât include the truly damaging elements.""",Yes
313,2,malware,Flubot: Warning over major Android 'package delivery' scam,23 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56859091,"A text-message scam that infects Android phones is spreading across the UK, experts have warned.
The message - which pretends to be from a package delivery firm, prompts users to install a tracking app - but is actually a malicious piece of spyware.
Called Flubot, it can take over devices and spy on phones to gather sensitive data, including online banking details.
Network operator Vodafone said millions of the text messages were already being sent, across all networks.
""We believe this current wave of Flubot malware SMS attacks will gain serious traction very quickly, and it's something that needs awareness to stop the spread,"" a spokesman said.
Customers should ""be especially vigilant with this particular piece of malware"", he said, and be very careful about clicking on any links in a text message.
Other networks, including EE and Three, followed with warnings of their own.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) later issued guidance about the threat, including advice on what to do if you have already downloaded the attacker's application by mistake.
""If users have clicked a malicious link it's important not to panic - there are actionable steps they can take to protect their devices and their accounts,"" the NCSC said in a statement.
The malware also has the ability to send more text messages to an infected user's contacts, helping it spread.
""The seriousness of these malicious text messages is underlined by Vodafone making the decision to alert its customers,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.
""This has the potential to become a denial-of-service attack on mobile networks, given the clear risk that a rogue application can be installed on users' smartphones and start spewing out endless text messages.
""The broader risk for users is a loss of highly sensitive personal data from their phones,"" he added.
While text message scams claiming to be about a package delivery firm are common, they have mostly focused on phishing - trying to trick the user into filling in a form with bank details and other information.
This newest wave differs because it tries to install malicious software on the phone itself - and because of the scale of its spread.
One version of the scam reported online pretends to be a text message from DHL, with a link to a website for parcel tracking.
If someone using an Android phone clicks on the link, they will be taken to a page ""explaining"" how to install the parcel tracking app using something called an APK.
APK files are a way of installing Android apps outside of the secure Google Play store. By default, such applications will be blocked for security reasons, but the scam page includes instructions on how to allow the installation.
That can be confusing, as there are some niche genuine cases for installing those kind of apps - such as downloading the Fortnite video game, which was removed from the official app store amid a major legal row between its owner and Google.
Apple iPhone users are not affected as those phones cannot install Android APKs.
In a blog post detailing the scam, security researcher Paul Morrison wrote that he expects the ""success rate would be low"" due to the hurdles involved.
But he said: ""With the number of SMS being sent out, just a 0.1% success rate could be very profitable.""
The Flubot malware has also spread in other countries in recent months - notably Spain, Germany and Poland.
Kate Bevan, computing editor at consumer magazine Which? said people have to be ""wary"" of texts.
""If you're not sure, contact the delivery company's official customer service helpline,"" she said.

314,3,malware,Malware found on laptops given out by government,21 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55749959,"Some of the laptops given out in England to support vulnerable children home-schooling during lockdown contain malware, BBC News has learned.
Teachers shared details on an online forum about suspicious files found on devices sent to a Bradford school.
The malware, which they said appeared to be contacting Russian servers, is believed to have been found on laptops given to a handful of schools.
The Department for Education said it was aware and urgently investigating.
A DfE official told BBC News: ""We are aware of an issue with a small number of devices. And we are investigating as an urgent priority to resolve the matter as soon as possible.
""DfE IT teams are in touch with those who have reported this issue.""
""We believe this is not widespread.""
Geo, the firm which made the laptops, told the BBC: ""We have been working closely with the Department for Education regarding a reported issue on a very small number of devices. We are providing our full support during their investigation.
""We take all matters of security extremely seriously. Any schools that have concerns should contact the Department for Education.""
According to the forum, the Windows laptops contained Gamarue.I, a worm identified by Microsoft in 2012.
The government has so far sent schools more than 800,000 laptops, as it tries to distribute more than a million devices to disadvantaged pupils who may not have access at home.
""Upon unboxing and preparing them, it was discovered that a number of the laptops were infected with a self-propagating network worm,"" wrote Marium Haque, deputy director of Education and Learning at Bradford Council.
She recommended that schools also check their networks ""as an added precaution"".
Information security consultant Paul Moore told the BBC that the Gamarue worm ""presents a very severe threat to any PC or network"".
""Ideally users should reboot into safe mode and run a full scan with an anti-virus product,"" he said.
""However with this type of malware, it is advisable to seek professional assistance in order to ensure it has been correctly removed.""
The malware in question installs spyware which can gather information about browsing habits, as well as harvest personal information such as banking details.
""The fact that these devices were not checked and scrubbed before being sent to vulnerable children is a concern,"" said George Glass, head of threat intelligence at security firm Redscan.",Yes
315,4,malware,Subway customers receive 'malware' emails,11 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55279051,"Subway customers in the UK are receiving scam emails as part of a phishing attack.
Users took to social media to complain about the emails, which claim to be an order confirmation from the fast-food chain and contain links to malware.
The emails also use the victims' names, and appear to come from the chain's Subcard loyalty scheme.
Subway has not said whether its databases have been compromised or what the source of the scam is.
But the firm has acknowledged that there is a problem.
A spokesperson for the company said: ""We are aware of some disruption to our email systems and understand some of our guests have received an unauthorised email.""
It apologised for any inconvenience and advised people to delete the email.
The problem was earlier reported by computer security news site Bleeping Computer, which said it had found a form of malware called TrickBot in the malicious links the email encourages users to click.
Trickbot is designed to steal personal information from infected computers, and can also install other viruses and ransomware.
The email links to fake documents that supposedly need to be confirmed - including insurance documents for the sandwich, suggesting that the attack had been repurposed from an existing scam.
Bleeping Computer reports that these documents include an Excel spreadsheet download, which asks users to enable additional features that install the virus.
It is not clear how the attacker accessed the details of customers.
Online, some recipients claimed that the attack email appeared to come from the address that the company usually uses.
Update 12 December:
Subway has issued a fresh statement: ""Having investigated the matter, we have no evidence that guest accounts have been hacked. However, the system which manages our email campaigns has been compromised, leading to a phishing campaign that involved first name and email. The system does not hold any bank or credit card details. Crisis protocol was initiated and compromised systems locked down. The safety of our guests and their personal data is our overriding priority and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.""",Yes
316,5,malware,Chinese phones with built-in malware sold in Africa,25 August 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53903436,"Malware which signed users up to subscription services without their permission has been found on thousands of mobiles sold in Africa.
Anti-fraud firm Upstream found the malicious code on 53,000 Tecno handsets, sold in Ethiopia, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana and South Africa.
Manufacturer Transsion told Buzzfeed it was installed in the supply chain without its knowledge.
Upstream said it was taking advantage of the ""most vulnerable"".
""The fact that the malware arrives pre-installed on handsets that are bought in their millions by typically low-income households tells you everything you need to know about what the industry is currently up against,"" said Geoffrey Cleaves, head of Upstream's Secure-D platform.
The Triada malware found by the firm on the Android smartphones installs malicious code known as xHelper which then finds subscription services and submits fraudulent requests on behalf of users, doing so invisibly and without the user's knowledge.
If the request is successful, it consumes pre-paid airtime, the only way to pay for digital services in many developing countries.
In total, Upstream found what it described as ""suspicious activity"" on more than 200,000 Tecno smartphones.
According to research firm IDC, Transsion Holdings is one of China's leading phone manufacturers and in Africa it is the top-selling mobile manufacturer.
In response Tecno Mobile said that the issue was ""an old and solved mobile security issue globally"" to which it issued a fix in March 2018.
""For current W2 consumers that are potentially facing Triada issues now, they are highly recommended to download the over-the-air fix through their phone for installation or contact Tecno's after-sales service support for assistance in any questions,"" the firm told the BBC in a statement.
It added that it is attached ""great importance to consumers' data security and product safety"".
""Every single software installed on each device runs through a series of rigorous security checks, such as our own security scan platform,"" it added.
At the beginning of the year, security firm Malwarebytes warned that similar pre-installed apps were found on another Chinese Android phone - the UMX U686CL. This handset was offered to low-income families in the US via a government scheme.
And in 2016, researcher Ryan Johnson found that more than 700 million Android smartphones had malware installed.
Google, which developed the Android operating system, is aware of the issue.
In a blog written last year it blamed third-party vendors, used by manufacturers to install features such as face unlock, for pre-installing Triada malware.

317,6,malware,Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks?,8 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419,"Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks.
Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.
Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware.
However, the new report comes on the back of a recent significant security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system.
And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with.
So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried?
Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.
Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers.
This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system.
Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware.
""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.
Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security.
""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot.""
There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as RobbinHood, a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019.
Another example is Thunderspy, an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other.
This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep.
""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.
""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more.""
The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops).
""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC.
Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software, because they only make money if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.
Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws.
The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years.
Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.
Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.
Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds.
""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do.""
Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole, to pay attention to hardware security.
""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.
""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected.""
Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.
""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.
""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""",Yes
318,7,malware,US-government issued phones run 'Chinese malware',9 January 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51054901,"Mobile phones offered to low-income families via a US government scheme come preloaded with Chinese malware, according to a security company.
Malwarebytes said it had received several complaints that pre-installed apps on the phone were malicious.
It had bought one to verify the claims and informed the company selling them, Assurance Wireless, of its findings but had not received a response, it said.
The Android-based phone - UMX U686CL - is made by a Chinese company.
BBC News has contacted Virgin Mobile - which owns Assurance Wireless - for comment but has not yet received a response.
One of the pre-installed apps, which looks and operates as a wireless update program, automatically installs more apps without user consent, according to Malwarebytes.
And it appears to be a variant of Adups, malware previously traced to China, which transmits text, call-location and app data to a Chinese server every 72 hours.
In 2016, researcher Ryan Johnson, of security company Kryptowire, found more than 700 million Android smartphones, including some in the US, had Adups installed. His report prompted investigations from Google and the Department of Homeland Security.
A second app containing malware, on the UMX U686CL phone, used code containing Chinese characters, Malwarebytes said.
And neither of the apps were removable.
""That there's a mobile device available for purchase through a US government-funded programme raises the bar on bad behaviour by app-development companies,"" said Malwarebytes security consultant Nathan Collier in a blogpost.
""It's important to realise that UMX isn't alone.
""There are many reports of budget phones coming pre-installed with malware and these reports are increasing in number.
""Although I don't have the answer to this widespread issue, I can say that US citizens using the Lifeline Assistance Program and many others on a tight budget deserve more.""
The lifeline programme has been offered to low-income Americans since 1985.
Typically, users pay about $10 (Â£8) a month for a 3G phone with between 500MB and 1GB of data.

All new apps will be scanned by malware-spotting tools from three cyber-security companies as well as Google's own in-house system.
Google said it needed help because the number of apps being uploaded was too large for it to handle alone.
Nasty Play apps can hit lots of people. Malicious code found in June was in apps downloaded 400 million times.
Security companies Zimperium, Eset and Lookout will work together on what Google has called the App Defense Alliance.
The four partners will set up a combined scanning system that will scrutinise apps as they pass through Google's pipeline on the way to being offered to Android users via the Play store.
Working from massive databases of known malware, behavioural clues and machine-learning models of novel threats the scanners will look for trojans, adware, ransomware, banking malware and phishing attacks.
""On the malware side, we haven't really had a way to scale as much as we've wanted to scale,"" Dave Kleidermacher, Google's vice-president of Android security, told Wired magazine.
Mr Kleidermacher added there were so many apps being developed, even making a ""1% incremental improvement"" could make a difference.
The scanning system is the latest in a series of steps Google has taken in its bid to do a better job of policing the Play store.
In April, it announced more rigorous checks for developers to root out ""bad faith"" coders who produced and uploaded malicious or fraudulent apps.",Yes

CamScanner has been downloaded more than 100 million times by Android users.
However, cyber-security researchers at Kaspersky say they found that a recent version contained malicious code in the part of the app that delivers ads.
The malware could have made it possible to show users intrusive ads or snoop on login credentials.
Kaspersky's researchers noted that CamScanner was a ""legitimate"" app, but think that the snippet of malicious code found in it was third-party code used to serve ads within apps.
A spokeswoman for Kaspersky told the BBC that researchers did not examine the iPhone version of CamScanner to see if it was also affected.
The free version of CamScanner for Android is currently not available on Google's Play Store in the UK.
CamScanner said it had released a new version of the app, with the malicious code removed.
If you have automatic updates enabled for your apps, which many people do, there is a chance you have a version of CamScanner containing malware on your device.
If in doubt, it is best to delete CamScanner and wait for a new version to be launched and tested by cyber-security researchers, said Matthew Hickey at security firm Hacker House.
Users may also use an anti-virus app to check for any malicious software that might have been installed.
""It is said the average consumer has around 40 applications on their phone they will use frequently, so ensure you regularly review any of those applications that you are not using,"" he told the BBC.
Mr Hickey also advised users who have mobile banking apps to be particularly cautious and use an anti-virus app that can regularly check for malicious code.
This was important because there had been a ""sharp increase"" recently in discoveries of malware infecting apps on the Google Play app store, he added.",Yes

In April, 25-year-old Marcus Hutchins pleaded guilty to two charges of making malicious software, or malware.
Prosecutors alleged that the malware let cyber-criminals steal online banking details from internet users.
Hutchins admitted to creating two programs known as Kronos and UPAS Kit.
Since Hutchins' arrest in 2017, he has remained in the US on bail.
The judge presiding at Hutchins' hearing, JP Stadtmueller, said that the 25-year-old would face one year of supervised release.
However, he would be allowed to return to the UK and would not have to pay any fines.
Hutchins had faced a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
In court documents filed earlier this year, investigators acknowledged that Hutchins, known online as MalwareTech, was no longer involved in creating malware.
He created Kronos and UPAS Kit between 2012 and 2015 but later switched towards ethical hacking and cyber-security research.
US prosecutors argued Hutchins still bore responsibility for his actions.
This did not seem to sway the judge who praised Hutchins for ""turning a corner"" during sentencing at the court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Hutchins, from Ilfracombe in Devon, was credited with discovering a ""kill switch"" for the WannaCry ransomware, which hit the NHS and many other organisations around the world in May 2017.
Three months later, he was arrested by the FBI before boarding a flight from Las Vegas to the UK.
He had been attending the Def Con cyber-security conference in the city.

""Due to a potential language barrier issue,"" staff believed she was related to a club member and let her in.
Mr Trump was in Palm Beach at the time of the incident on Saturday 30 March.
Ms Zhang - who was described in the affidavit as an ""Asian female"" - is charged with making false statements to a federal officer and illegally entering a restricted area.
According to the court documents, upon entry to the club Ms Zhang changed her story, telling a front-desk receptionist she was there to attend a ""United Nations Chinese American Association"" event.
The receptionist, who knew that such an event had been scheduled, became suspicious of Ms Zhang.
The suspect was transported off the property for further questioning.
She told agents she had been instructed by a friend, identified only as ""Charles"", to travel from Shanghai, China, to Palm Beach to attend the purported United Nations event, but did not provide any more details, according to court documents.
She said ""Charles"" had encouraged her to attempt to speak to a member of the president's family about Chinese-American economic relations, said the affidavit.
Secret service agent Samuel Ivanovich said Ms Zhang carried four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing a computer virus, but no swim suit.
In the court document, Mr Ivanovich notes that Ms Zhang ""freely and without difficulty conversed"" in English, becoming ""verbally aggressive"" with authorities as the investigation progressed.

It is the first time that the agency - part of the GCHQ intelligence service - has given guidance to a sector caring for such young children.
It includes warnings to use password protection for information for parents.
""We know that incidents affecting the education sector are increasingly common,"" said Sarah Lyons at the NCSC.
The cyber-agency says pre-school providers and childminders are ""increasingly relying on technology to operate"" and have become an ""appealing target"" for cyber-attacks.
Cyber-criminals could be seeking personal information about children or families, and to target the payments process for parents, warns the NCSC.
The early years cyber-security advice warns about malicious software, so-called ""malware"", and the need to protect personal information and data.
""Cyber-criminals will go after anybody, provided there's money to be made,"" says the NCSC's advice.
The cyber-security agency calls for a more secure approach to sharing information, including newsletters for parents.
""You should password protect newsletters so only families who have been given the password can open them,"" says the guidance.
The NCSC says many scam emails are ""preying on fears of Covid-19"" and warns nurseries and child minders to watch out for fake messages trying to obtain information with false claims, including:
There are also warnings about protecting computer devices, including smartphones, and to guard against scam phone calls and text messages.

328,17,malware,Apple chipmaker recovers after malware attack,6 August 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45089095,"A Taiwanese company that makes chips for Apple's iPhone is back in full production after being infected with malware at the weekend.
The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) had to shut down parts of its factories.
It said the attack had featured a ""mutation"" of the Wannacry ransomware.
The manufacturing giant denied that it had been hacked and blamed an error during the installation of a new tool that had not been taken offline first.
Chief executive CC Wei told reporters he was ""shocked and surprised"" that the attack had taken place.
""It's impossible that humans would never make mistakes and we have changed the system to automatically detect [the virus] and such a mistake would never be made again,"" he told Reuters.
The company did not comment on where the malware may have originated.
TSMC's other clients include Nvidia and Qualcomm. It is often listed as one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers.
""The issues suffered by TSMC remind us that any organisation, even those working at the forefront of technology development, can fall victim to malware,"" said Thomas Nuth, director of product at cyber-security company Nozomi Networks.
""While downtime can be a frustrating inconvenience for most, when it targets the manufacturing process the results can be exceptionally expensive.""",Yes
329,18,malware,Emotet botnet taken down by international police swoop,27 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55826258,"Police have seized thousands of computers running one of the most dangerous hacking networks worldwide.
The Emotet network obtains access to victims' computers, via malicious email attachments, then sells it to criminals who install more dangerous malware.
Police from the UK, EU, US and Canada worked together to ""disrupt"" Emotet.
Europol called it ""one of most significant botnets of the past decade"" and one of the main ""door openers"" for computer systems worldwide.
""Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware,"" it said.
Dmitry Smilyanets, from Recorded Future, said: ""Even if the creator and his support and operators are not arrested, they likely will not try to rebuild.
""They have enough cash to retire in peace - or start a new criminal adventure.
""A working botnet is a very complicated and gentle system.
""If more than a half of the infrastructure is not working, it's safe to say bye-bye.""
Emotet was initially a banking trojan, designed to spy on victims' computers and steal login details.
Victims would receive an apparently important Word document marked for their attention.
When opened, it would ask them to ""enable Macros"" - a seemingly innocent feature built into Microsoft Word that actually opened their computer up to attackers.
Lotem Finkelstein, of Check Point Software, said it had been tracking Emotet for years.
""The most successful and prevalent malware of 2020 by a long way"", he said, it had, over the course of the year, sent phishing emails with more than 150,000 different subject lines and 100,000 file names for the attachments.
""It constantly adjusted its phishing emails to victims' interests and global events - for example, the Covid-19 pandemic or major shopping seasons such as Black Friday,"" Mr Finkelstein said.
And although the Europol announcement may seem ""abstract"", it would protect ""the public from cyber-threats that have caused losses of millions, if not more, of dollars"".",Yes

The US Office of the Inspector General has recommended that the USGS blacklist ""rogue"" websites.
""Our analysis confirmed that many of the pornographic images were subsequently saved to an unauthorised USB device and personal Android cell phone,"" the report explained
As well as government computers, the employee's personal mobile was also found to be infected.
Reports of the case were picked up by news site TechCrunch, which confirmed that the Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (Eros) does not maintain any classified networks.
The site also reported that the malware in question was designed to steal data from infected computers and was ""associated"" with ransomware attacks.

Several anti-malware apps made by Trend Micro have since been updated by the cyber-security company.
However, Trend Micro strongly denied allegations that the apps had been ""stealing user data"" and sending it to a server in China.
The apps' behaviour was noticed by a security researcher last week.
Three apps, Dr Cleaner, Dr Antivirus and App Uninstall, made by Trend Micro, were removed from the Apple Mac app store, though the tech giant has not publicly confirmed why.
""Reports that Trend Micro is 'stealing user data' and sending them to an unidentified server in China are absolutely false,"" said Trend Micro in a statement.
It added that it had completed an initial investigation which had confirmed that several apps, including Dr Cleaner and Dr Antivirus, had collected and uploaded ""a small snapshot of the browser history on a one-time basis"" at installation.
The firm said this was done for ""security purposes"", in order to analyse whether a user had recently encountered adware or other threats.
However, it added that it had decided to remove this function from the apps.
In an update to the statement, Trend Micro said, ""We apologise to our community for concern they might have felt and can reassure all that their data is safe and at no point was compromised.""

332,21,malware,Exchange email hack: Hundreds of UK firms compromised,11 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56365372,"Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers.
Cyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack.
It comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems.
But some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses.
Meanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly.
The hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium.
Microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies.
The attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world.
Microsoft released software updates for the so called ""zero-day"" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves.
However, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected.
According to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries.
Cyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves.
""As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,"" Jake Moore at Eset said.
""The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers.""
A webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network.
Once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks.
Globally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK.
Cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems.
CyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour.
The companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail.
Sean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: ""It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems.
""It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind.
""There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.""",Yes

Marcus Hutchins, who denies the charges, has asked his Twitter followers to help with his legal fees.
Mr Hutchins was arrested at Las Vegas airport in August last year after he left the Black Hat conference.
He was accused of creating a piece of malware known as Kronos.
Kronos was designed to steal banking credentials.
According to a new court filing, Mr Hutchins is now also accused of creating a second piece of malware, known as UPAS Kit.
He is also accused of distributing it with the help of another person.
According to the court document, the malware was created in 2012 to be installed silently and not alert anti-virus software. It is alleged to have collected personal information.
Mr Hutchins's lawyer, Brian Klein, described the new indictment as ""meritless"".
The cyber-security researcher is originally from Ilfracombe, Devon, and works for LA-based company Kryptos Logic.
He shot to fame after helping to stall the WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack that struck the NHS and other organisations in May 2017.
The cyber-attack targeted 150 countries and locked down computers, demanding a $300 (Â£223) fee to restore files.
Mr Hutchins was granted bail on 5 August after $30,000 (Â£23,000) was raised by friends and family.",Yes

It follows a series of complaints, including a high-profile one from Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite.
Some developers are unhappy that they are forced to distribute apps to iPhones and iPads via the App Store, and the commission Apple takes.
Apple said its terms were ""fair and equal"".
The investigation will consider whether Apple has a dominant position in the distribution of apps on its devices and look at whether it imposes unfair terms on developers.
Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: ""Millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway. So complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice - potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps - warrant careful scrutiny.""
In response, Apple said: ""We believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish. The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place - applied fairly and equally to all developers - to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent.
""We look forward to working with the UK Competition and Markets Authority to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the App Store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers.""
Epic Games has launched a legal action against Apple and Google in the US, after both removed Fortnite from their smartphone app stores.
The row centred on the up to 30% cut both the tech giants take when people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store, as well as the difficulty in launching a mobile app without submitting to both companies' app store rules.
In August Epic bypassed the Apple and Google stores to let Fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, directly from it, resulting in an immediate ban from both stores.
The row has attracted the attention of both regulators and politicians.
Arizona's state House of Representatives passed a law this week which prohibits Apple and Google, and any other app store exceeding one million downloads, from demanding developers based in the state exclusively use its app stores.
The law also covers users living in the state, but it is not yet clear how it will affect companies headquartered in other states but conducting sales in Arizona. It will now be handed to the state Senate for approval.
In Europe, Apple is facing two investigations into whether it has broken competition rules, one of which relates to its app store policies.",Yes

Many of the apps infected with the malware are aimed at children, and some have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.
The malware also promotes fake security programs and tries to get people to sign up to expensive services.
Google said it had now removed all the compromised apps from the Play store.
The ""AdultSwine"" malware was discovered by researchers from CheckPoint software, which said apps harbouring the code had been downloaded at least three million times.
Infected apps include add-ons for the hugely popular pocket edition of Minecraft as well as apps themed around well known Disney characters.
The CheckPoint researchers uncovered the infected apps as well as the infrastructure used to pipe offensive adverts and other offers to victims.
Reviews of infected apps on Google's store warned about the presence of the pop-up adverts.
CheckPoint said AdultSwine was a ""nasty nuisance"" that was ""most certainly damaging on both an emotional and financial level"".

NHS Lanarkshire also warned patients not to attend hospital unless their visit is ""essential"" and said waiting times may be longer than usual.
But the board's chief executive, Calum Campbell, said the source of the malware had now been indentified.
Investigations are ongoing into how the malware was able to infect the network.
It was not clear if the health service had been deliberately targeted.
The cyber attack started on Friday. Operations were cancelled and the work of GPs was disrupted.
The health board said it ""took immediate action"" to put a solution in place and minimise disruption.
On Saturday morning, NHS Lanarkshire confirmed the problems were still affecting its staff bank system, which it uses to ensure shifts are filled on wards and clinics.
It asked staff to call a temporary number to check if they were needed to cover shifts over the next 72 hours.
Mr Campbell said staff had been working hard to minimise the impact on patients and contingency plans had been put in place to ensure services could be delivered while the IT issues were resolved.
""Unfortunately a small number of procedures and appointments have been cancelled as a result of the incident,"" he said.
""I would like to apologise to anyone who has been affected by this disruption, however I can assure you that work is already underway to reappoint patients.""

338,27,malware,Bitcoin boom prompts growth of coin-mining malware,20 October 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41693556,"The booming price of Bitcoin and other crypto-coins has kicked off a gold rush among malicious hackers keen to cash in, warn security firms.
Many sites are now harbouring code that secretly uses a visitors' computer to mine the valuable e-cash coins.
The code is inserted by hackers who exploit poor site security or web software bugs.
The problem has led Google engineers to consider putting protections against mining in the Chrome browser.
Earlier this month, hundreds of websites were found to be running code created by the Coin-Hive project. This let the web domains generate coins for the Monero crypto-currency by using the processing power of visitors' computers.
While some sites had put the Coin-Hive code on their site themselves, many others had been hacked to host the short script.
Bitcoin, and almost every other crypto-coin, works by using lots of different computers to log and verify who has done what with the electronic coins. In return for carrying out these computational tasks, called mining, users are regularly rewarded with new coins.
Palo Alto Networks said it had found Coin-Hive on almost 150 separate domains. The most popular locations for the code were porn, video and file-sharing sites.
""The use of Coin-Hive or similar mining services is itself not a malicious activity,"" said Yuchen Zhou and colleagues at security company Palo Alto. ""It is how they are used that makes the sites malicious.""
The wide uptake of Coin-Hive and the surging price of Bitcoin, now worth about $5,630 (Â£4,288) per coin, has led to the creation of many ""copycat"" coin-mining systems.
Security news website Bleeping Computer has now found 10 separate ""clones"" of Coin-Hive that mine different types of coins for their creators.
""Most are behaving like malware, intruding on users' computers and using resources without permission,"" wrote Catalin Cimpanu on the Bleeping Computer site. On portable devices, the code can drain batteries very quickly.
Some of the copycat coin-mining programs specifically target popular website creation and admin systems such as WordPress. Others, said Mr Cimpanu, are written in Javascript and their creators try to insert them wherever they can.
Many anti-virus firms have updated their software so they now spot and disable mining software.
Also, Coin-Hive has now launched an authorised version of its software which only mines coins if users give their explicit permission.
The growing number of coin miners kicked off a discussion among Google engineers working on the firm's Chrome browser about how to tackle it.
""Yes, we should do something about it,"" wrote Ojan Vafai, a Chrome engineer on the forums where browser changes are debated.
Mr Vafai suggested getting the browser to watch for situations when mining software grabs lots of processing power from a computer or portable device.
If the browser spots this activity it would ""aggressively throttle"" browser activity to limit how much number-crunching power can be grabbed. Users would also be warned about what was happening.
The change would let users see when their browser was being used for mining and let them choose if it continued. Blocking the activity any other way would be difficult, he said.
""I'm effectively suggesting we add a permission here, but it would have unusual triggering conditions,"" he wrote. ""It only triggers when the page is doing a likely bad thing.""",Yes

Panic founder Steven Frank admitted in a blog post that it happened after he downloaded an infected copy of the video encoding tool Handbrake.
He said there was no sign that any customer data was accessed and that Panic's web server was not affected.
Users have been warned to download Panic's apps only from its website or the Apple App Store.
Panic is the creator of web editing and file transfer apps Coda and Transmit, and co-published the video game Firewatch with developers Campo Santo.
On 2 May Handbrake was hacked, with the Mac version of the app on one of the site's download servers replaced by a malicious copy.
The infected app was discovered and removed on 6 May.
In what Mr Frank called ""a case of extraordinarily bad luck"", he downloaded the malicious version of Handbrake and launched it ""without stopping to wonder why Handbrake would need admin privilegesâ¦ when it hadn't before"".
""And that was that, my Mac was completely, entirely compromised in three seconds or less.""
The attacker then used his password to access other private files and copy the source code for several of Panic's products stored on the infected computer.
The theft was confirmed when Panic received an email containing some of the files and demanding a ransom for the return of the complete code.
""We're working on the assumption that there's no point in paying,"" Mr Frank wrote, saying that ""the attacker has no reason to keep their end of the bargain"".
The FBI is investigating the incident and Panic has been working with Apple to make sure that no malicious or fake versions of the apps get into the App Store.

340,29,malware,WannaCry and the malware hall of fame,16 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39928456,"2017 has been a bumper year for malware outbreaks. We had the WannaCry worm causing havoc around the world for days, followed most recently by the Petya outbreak. But they are not the first to spread so far, so fast. The history of technology and the net has been regularly punctuated by outbreaks and infections.
In 1988, just as the internet was starting to catch on, computer science student Robert T Morris was curious about just how big it had grown. He wrote a small program that travelled around, logging the servers it visited.
Bugs in his code made it scan the net very aggressively so every server ended up running multiple copies of the worm. Each copy used up a little bit of processing power so the servers gradually slowed to a halt.
The scanning traffic clogged the net making it almost unusable. It took days to clean up the infection.
Mr Morris was caught and found guilty of computer fraud and was fined $10,050 (Â£7,785).
These days, he is a computer scientist at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
The Morris worm has one strange parallel with WannaCry. Mr Morris was the son of the NSA's chief scientist and the WannaCry worm is based on code stolen from the NSA.
In May 2000, millions of Windows users found endless copies of an email bearing the subject line ILOVEYOU in their inboxes.
It spread so far and so fast thanks to the booby-trapped file attached to it. Opening the file fired up the small program it contained which sent a copy of the same message to all the addresses found in a victim's address book.
It was also helped to spread because all those messages appeared to come from someone a recipient knew. And the subject line made people curious too.
ILOVEYOU rattled around the world for almost two weeks racking up more than 50 million infections. High-profile victims included the CIA, Pentagon and UK Parliament.
Philippine students Reonel Ramones and Onel de Guzman were found to be the creators of ILOVEYOU. They escaped prosecution because there were no computer misuse laws in the Philippines at that time.
Active in July 2001 and named after the fizzy pop being drunk by the researchers who found it, this worm targeted web servers running Microsoft IIS software.
It caused severe disruption and many websites, small businesses and larger firms were knocked offline for a while.
No-one has ever been named as Code Red's creator although on servers it compromised it displayed a message suggesting it originated in China.
Like Wannacry, Code Red exploited a known bug and caught out servers that had not been updated with a patch.
This worm emerged in January 2003 and was so virulent that it is believed to have slowed down traffic across the entire net as it spread.
Slammer was a tiny program, roughly 376 bytes, that did little more than create random net addresses and then send itself to those places. If it hit a machine running a vulnerable version of Microsoft's SQL server, that machine got infected and then started spraying out more copies seeking more victims.
The slowdown was caused by net routers struggling to cope with the massive amounts of traffic Slammer generated while seeking out new hosts.
Again, a patch was available for the bug it exploited but many people had not applied it despite it being available for six months.
This Windows email worm from January 2004 is believed to hold the current record for spreading fastest - hardly surprising given that it was reputedly created by professional spammers.
It worked so well thanks to a clever bit of social engineering. The email bearing the worm was designed to look like an error message. This fiction was aided by the message's attachment which purported to hold a copy of the email that did not arrive.
Opening the attachment kicked off the malicious code that re-sent the same message to everyone in a victim's address book.
November 2008 saw the arrival of this virulent worm which hit up to 15 million servers running Microsoft software. It ran rampant and caught out hospitals, governments, the armed forces and many businesses.
The outbreak was so bad that Microsoft offered a $250,000 reward for any information leading to the identification of the worm's creator. No-one has ever been identified as its originator.
A patch closing the loophole it exploited was released by Microsoft about a month after it appeared. Even today, 10 years on, data traffic generated by machines infected with Conficker regularly turn up.",Yes

342,31,malware,Britney Spears: Malware planted in singer's Instagram page,8 June 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40200400,"The comments section of Britney Spears' Instagram account has been used by cyber-thieves to co-ordinate attacks.
Security firm Eset found the gang controlled its malware, called Turla, by posting comments about images in the singer's gallery.
The comments looked like spam but once transformed by code in the virus, directed victims to other sites.
Several other compromised websites were also being used to track victims and spread the malware.
Turla has been active since 2014 and sought to catch out government workers, diplomats and other officials, said Eset researcher Jean-Ian Boutin. It is believed to be run by a hacker group working for the Russian state.
Most often, he said, Turla's handlers compromised websites that targets would be likely to visit.
One compromised server asked visitors to install a booby-trapped extension for the Firefox web browser.
Digital detective work by Mr Boutin revealed that the command and control (C&C) channel set up between the creators of the extension and victims' machines was on the singer's Instagram page.
The malicious extension searched for comments that, when digitally transformed, matched a specific value. These were then converted into a website address that the compromised machine visited to report in or to update the malicious code they harboured.
Very few comments posted to the Instagram account had the key characteristics - suggesting that Turla's creators were testing or refining the control system.
Mr Boutin said using social media in this way made ""life harder for defenders"".
""Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish malicious traffic to social media from legitimate traffic,"" he wrote. ""Secondly, it gives the attackers more flexibility when it comes to changing the C&C address as well as erasing all traces of it.""
Mr Boutin added that he had been in touch with Mozilla, which was working on ways to stop extensions for Firefox being compromised in this way.
In a statement, Instagram said: ""We are aware of this activity and have taken action against the responsible accounts.""",Yes
343,32,malware,CIA faces huge problem over malware claims,7 March 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39197664,"Already embroiled in a row with President Donald Trump amid his claims that spies are leaking secrets against him, now the CIA is facing its own damaging leaks.
This time it's the American intelligence community's familiar foe - Wikileaks - with another cache of what look like highly sensitive secret documents, this time about the CIA's technical capabilities.
The National Security Agency faced its problems when Edward Snowden passed on documents to journalists - but this time it's the NSA's sister agency.
While the NSA is the agency charged with collecting what is called signals intelligence and the CIA's job is to recruit human spies, the reality is that the technical and the human side of espionage have been drawing closer for years.
The CIA created a Directorate of Digital Innovation whose director told me the priority was making sure the agency stayed on top of technology.
While the NSA may sift global internet traffic looking for intelligence, the CIA prioritises close access against specific targets who it is interested in.
And getting into someone's electronic devices can be vital if you are trying to target them - either to recruit them as an agent or for a drone strike against a suspected terrorist.
These latest leaks will be a huge problem for the CIA as the Snowden leaks were for the NSA (although there will be less surprise about these capabilities now since we learned so much from the Snowden files).
There is the embarrassment factor - that an agency whose job is to steal other people's secrets has not been able to keep their own.
This will be added to by the revelations that the US consulate in Frankfurt was used as a base for the technical operations which may cause problems in Germany where the Edward Snowden revelations caused intense domestic debate.
Then there will be the fear of a loss of intelligence coverage by the CIA against their targets who may change their behaviour because they now know the spies can do.
And then there will be the questions over whether the CIA's technical capabilities were too expansive and too secret.
Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the ""equities"" problem - when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology, how do you balance the benefit of leaving that vulnerability in place so the intelligence agency can exploit it to collect intelligence with the benefit to the public of informing the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone's security?
If an intelligence agency has found a vulnerability then other hackers might do as well. The NSA faced questions about whether it had found the right balance and now it may be the CIA's turn.
There will be anger in the CIA and some of that will be directed at Wikileaks.
Wikileaks has said the source of this latest cache of documents came from a former US government hacker or contractor.
But it is an organisation that the US intelligence community has claimed may have been a route for information hacked from the Democrats by the Russians during last year's election to make it into the public domain.
No doubt the CIA will be trying to establish the exact source of the latest leak and understand the timing - coming right in the middle of an intensifying row between American spies and their own president.",Yes
344,33,malware,Millions of Android phones hit by 'Judy' malware,30 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40092540,"More than 36 million Android devices may have been infected with ad-click malware, a security firm has said.
Researchers at Check Point said they found the malware, dubbed Judy, on about 50 apps in Google's Play Store.
The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators.
The infected apps have been removed from the Play Store.
More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, Kiniwini, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name Enistudio.
The games, all of which feature a character called Judy, have been downloaded between four million and 18 million times.
The malicious code was also found in several apps from other developers.
""It is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly,"" said Check Point.
Between them, the infected apps may have been downloaded up to 36.5 million times.
Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the Judy games had been updated since March this year.
The oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in April 2016, which Check Point suggested, means that ""the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play Store undetected"".
Because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown.
The apps got past the Play Store's protection system, Google Bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code.
Once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts.
This kind of delivery ""has become commonplace"", Andrew Smith, a senior lecturer in Networking at the Open University, told the BBC.
""There are many tools available, and the advantage is that the malware distributor can change them remotely, which makes it difficult for anti-malware software to keep up.""
The apps also display numerous adverts themselves, some of which cannot be closed until a user has clicked on them.",Yes
345,34,malware,Malware is making ATMs 'spit cash',22 November 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38063142,"A Russian cybersecurity firm has issued a warning about a spate of remotely coordinated attacks on cash machines.
Hacks of banks' centralised systems had made groups of machines issue cash simultaneously, a process known as ""touchless jackpotting"", said Group IB.
The machines had not been physically tampered with, it said, but ""money mules"" had waited to grab the cash.
Affected countries are said to include Armenia, Estonia, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain and the UK.
But the company declined to name any specific banks.
Dmitriy Volkov from Group IB told the BBC a successful attack could net its perpetrators up to $400,000 (Â£320,000) at a time.
""We have seen such attacks in Russia since 2013,"" he said.
""The threat is critical. Attackers get access to an internal bank's network and critical information systems. That allows them to rob the bank.""
Two cash machine manufacturers, Diebold Nixdorf and NCR Corp, told Reuters they were aware of the threat.
""They are taking this to the next level in being able to attack a large number of machines at once,"" said senior director Nicholas Billett, from Diebold Nixdorf.
""They know they will be caught fairly quickly, so they stage it in such a way that they can get cash from as many ATMs as they can before they get shut down.""
A recent report by Europol warned of the rise of cash-machine-related malware, although it said ""skimming"" - using hardware to steal card information at the machine itself - was still more common.
""The new method is being done by somehow gaining access to the banks' central systems and infecting whole communities of ATMs simultaneously, hence multiplying the amount of money that can be stolen in a short time,"" said Surrey University's cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward.
Because criminals were collecting the cash in person, it made the crime more difficult to trace, he added.
""The classic way of solving online financial crime is to 'follow the money' - but when you can no longer do this, it is very hard to find out who is behind it, even though the evidence suggests it is a very limited number of groups that have started perpetrating this type of crime.""",Yes

The apps, discovered on the Google Play Store, were designed to take control of devices before downloading malware.
Unwanted ads could then be displayed to users, for example, according to researchers at Check Point.
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
More than 40 guide apps for popular games were found to be capable of delivering the malware to users' devices, Check Point said.
It is thought that the apps were downloaded between 528,000 and 1.8 million times, though it is not known how many of these downloads resulted in the deployment of malware.
""Since the actual apps do not contain any malicious code themselves, it's very hard to trace,"" said Daniel Padon, at Check Point.
He added that when Check Point had notified Google about the apps they had been removed.
But the researchers said that they continued to find more examples on the Play Store.
Some of the apps were made available as long ago as November last year.
When one is downloaded, it asks users for device admin permission to ensure the software cannot be deleted.
It then attempts to establish a connection with a command and control server, turning the device into a bot in a botnet - a network of devices controlled from afar.
Malicious software can then be downloaded.
Mr Padon told the BBC that this could allow hackers to send illegitimate pop-up ads, use the device as part of a DDoS attack, or snoop on data sent via the device's network.
He said mobile botnets were becoming more common.
""We, other security vendors and Google have found different mobile botnets spreading via the Play Store,"" Mr Padon said.
""This is a hard thing to stop - it could have a devastating impact.""
The approach could indeed be dangerous, agreed Nikolaos Chrysaidos at cyber-security firm Avast.
""At the moment, it seems like the cyber-criminals behind the threat are only interested in making money from ads,"" he said.
""The threat currently has very basic functionalities [...] However, there is nothing stopping the threat from becoming more sophisticated in the future.""",Yes

The group, which earlier tried to sell the encrypted cache of hacking tools in an online auction, released a password for it via a blog on 8 April.
Some cyber-security experts have said some of the malware is real, but old.
The NSA has not commented on the hacker group or the material that was released over the weekend.
The Shadow Brokers said they had published the password as a ""protest"" about US President Donald Trump.
The group wanted ""America to be great again"", the blog added.
It criticised, among other things, ""[Steve] Bannon's removal from the [National Security Council]"" and the ""US military strike on Syria"".
A list of alleged NSA hacking targets and the malware allegedly installed at them was also included in the release, according to some cyber-security experts.
The Shadow Brokers say they are ""not fans of Russia or Putin"", but some experts have suggested the group may have links with the Russian government.
""Russia is quickly responding to the missile attacks on Syria with the release of the dump file password that was previously withheld,"" said Jake Williams, chief executive of cyber-security firm Rendition Infosec in a blog.
A similar opinion was shared on Twitter by Dan Gonzales, a senior scientist at the Rand Corporation think tank.
The Shadow Brokers were ""probably a front for or infiltrated by #Russia #cyber groups,"" he said.
Neither commentator gave any evidence to support such claims. Russian officials have not commented but have strenuously denied involvement in other hacking cases associated with the US.
""If Russia had stolen the hacking tools, it would be senseless to publicise the theft, let alone put them up for sale,"" cyber-security expert James Bamford wrote in an article for Reuters news agency.
He suggested that the Shadow Brokers could be an NSA ""insider"".
In a separate case, a series of cyber-attacks on 40 targets in 16 countries have been linked to a cache of hacking tools, according to cybersecurity firm Symantec.
The cache, known as Vault7, was published online by WikiLeaks and said to contain malware used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
The agency has not confirmed whether it authored the tools.
The malware analysed by Symantec had been used to infect computers in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
""On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally,"" Symantec noted.
The malware contained logs documenting changes that closely mirrored such records in Vault7 malware, the firm claimed.",Yes

Christopher Taylor, 57 and from Wigan, tricked 772 people in 39 countries into downloading malware from 2012 to 2015.
In 2016, after a US college discovered the programme, he told police and FBI he used it to take images and videos.
However, District Judge Michael Fanning ruled that extradition to the US ""would not be in the interests of justice"".
Westminster Magistrates Court was told the married father-of-three was wanted in the US to face trial on an indictment alleging one offence of wire fraud and two of computer fraud.
The court heard remote access tools were found on Mr Taylor's computer along with 772 files - one per victim - containing hundreds of saved webcam images, ""including images of people in various stages of undress and involved in sexual activity"".
His lawyer Ben Cooper QC argued that as ""only 7% of the victims were based in the US at the time with 93% outside of the US"", including several in the UK, Mr Taylor should face proceedings in England, where a criminal investigation has yet been launched.
He added in written submissions that the 57-year-old had not used the malware for ""sexual gratification"" or targeted anyone in particular, but had an ""obsessive interest in computers and hacking"".
In a written ruling, Judge Fanning said none of the people whose webcams were accessed were aware of Mr Taylor's ""illicit observation of them [and] certainly, none of them consented to it"".
However, he said he did ""find extradition would not be in the interests of justice"", but added that the US government ""can appeal or they may choose to provide evidence to the authorities in the UK, so you can be prosecuted here"".
Daniel Sternberg, representing the US government, indicated there would be an appeal.
Mr Taylor was granted conditional bail.

Mark Vartanyan, 29, developed and distributed the Citadel Trojan, which lets criminals steal bank account details and hold files to ransom.
US prosecutors said it had infected about 11 million computers worldwide.
He pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud, in a court in Atlanta, after being extradited from Norway.
Launched in 2011, Citadel was marketed on invitation-only, Russian-language internet forums used by cybercriminals.
Its users had targeted the computer networks of major financial and government institutions around the world, prosecutors said.
Vartanyan admitted to the ""development, improvement, maintenance and distribution"" of Citadel between 2012 and 2014 while living in Ukraine and Norway.
Operating under the alias Kolypto, he uploaded ""numerous electronic files"" that consisted of Citadel malware, components, updates and patches, as well as customer information.
Earlier in March, David LeValley, special agent at the FBI Atlanta Office, said Vartanyan's arrest removed ""a significant player"" from the resources available to cybercriminals.
""We must continue to impose real costs on criminals who believe they are protected by geographic boundaries and can prey on the American people,"" he said.
Vartanyan agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison term. He will be sentenced in June.
In September 2015, a US court sentenced Russian citizen Dimitry Belorossov to four years and six months in prison after he admitted distributing and installing Citadel on to computers.

351,40,malware,"Cyber-attack glossary: What are malware, patches and worms?",15 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39928596,"Ransomware called WannaCry has spread across 150 countries, earned its makers about $50,000 (Â£39,000) so far and in doing so, thrown some hospitals in England in to disarray as doctors could not access patient records. It was the story of the weekend and is still ongoing - but if the terms involved were new to you, read on.
Malware
Short for ""malicious software"", this is a programme written to disrupt computers or the networks between them. WannaCry falls in to this category.
A programme that scrambles a computer's files, demanding payment before they can be opened again. WannaCry asked for $300 in a virtual currency. Ransomware is not new, but WannaCry spread to more computers than previous ransomware attacks - and, because it hit computers used in hospital trusts, had a bigger impact that previous attempts.
Virus
A type of malware that spreads when people do things like inserting USB sticks with viruses in them, and downloading infected files. These are the reason why we are all warned not to open attachments in unexpected emails.
Worm
A type of virus that can spread from computer to computer by itself.
Vulnerability
A flaw in software that can be exploited to disrupt computers or networks
Patch
A software update that fixes a vulnerability. These do not exist for operating systems that are no longer supported by their makers.
Operating system
The important software that makes the whole computer run, from the user interface to memory, security, and applications. This might be iOS on an iPhone, Android on other smartphones, Mac OS X, Linux or Windows. Companies release new operating systems every few years; Microsoft's latest is Windows 10, which followed Windows 8.1. Windows XP, was first released in 2001 - a long time ago in technology terms - and Microsoft stopped supporting it in 2014. That means they stopped issuing security updates for vulnerabilities.
Bitcoin
A digital currency, in which the WannaCry makers asked for their ransom payments. It is easy to keep offline identities private when using BitCoin. The value of the currency fluctuates considerably, making it difficult to meet a ransom payment exactly.
Kill switch
A way to shut down the spread of a virus or worm.  A 22-year-old security specialist from England found WannaCry's kill switch accidentally while trying to track its spread. But he and others have warned that the people behind WannaCry could change it to get around the kill switch he found.",Yes

The efforts were directed against individuals in Iran and 12 other countries, including the UK and US, Check Point said.
It said the two groups involved were using new techniques to install spyware on targets' PCs and mobile devices.
And this was then being used to steal call recordings and media files.
One of the groups, known as Domestic Kitten or APT-50, is accused of tricking people into downloading malicious software on to mobile phones by a variety of means including:
The American-Israeli company's researchers documented 1,200 victims being targeted by the campaign, living in seven countries.
There had been more than 600 successful infections, it said.
The second group, known as Infy or Prince Of Persia, is said to spy on the home and work PCs of dissidents in 12 countries, extracting sensitive data after tricking people into opening malicious email attachments.
The Iranian government has not commented on the report.
Domestic Kitten's operation was first identified in 2018.
And Check Point said there was evidence it had run at least 10 campaigns since 2017.
Four of these were still active, with the most recent beginning in November 2020.
And it was using an Iranian blog site, Telegram channels and text messages to lure people into installing its infected software, which the researchers have dubbed Furball, which could:
The 600 successful infections are said to have included dissidents, opposition forces and people belonging to the Kurdish ethnic minority in:
The other group, Infy, is said to have been operating as far back as 2007.
Its most recent activity had targeted PCs, with fake emails with attractive content, usually with an attached document, Check Point said.
One example provided was of a document apparently about loans being offered to disabled veterans.
Once the document was opened, a spying tool was installed and sensitive data stolen, the company said.
Two documents recently used are said to have included a photo of an Iranian governor, with alleged contact details.
The researchers said Infy's capabilities were ""far superior"" to most other known Iranian campaigns, thanks to its ability to be highly selective about its targets and to have generally have gone undetected.
""It is clear that the Iranian government is investing significant resources into cyber-operations,"" Check Point cyber-research head Yaniv Balmas said.
""The operators of these Iranian cyber-espionage campaigns seem to be completely unaffected by any counter-activities done by others, even though both campaigns had been revealed and even stopped in the past.

353,42,malware,Insurers defend covering ransomware payments,27 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55811165,"The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has defended the inclusion of ransomware payments in first-party cyber-insurance policies.
It said insurance was ""not an alternative"" to doing everything possible to first minimise the risk.
However, it added that firms could face financial ruin without the cover.
Prof Ciaran Martin, former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said the UK needed to rethink its policies on ransomware.
Ransomware is a form of malware in which infected computers are remotely locked by cyber-criminals, who then demand a ransom, often in the form of Bitcoin, to unlock them and return the data they hold.
There are many examples of businesses and public bodies which have chosen to pay because they do not have the data backed up, or cannot afford - or do not have time - to rebuild their systems from scratch.
The Guardian reported that Prof Martin, now at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government, said he believed insurers were ""funding organised crime"" by accepting ransomware claims, but he told the BBC the issue of how to tackle ransomware was far broader than just the insurance sector.
While official advice is not to pay the demand, it is not illegal to do so in the UK, he said.
""I have some sympathy with insurers, because as long as it's legal, there are incentives to pay.""
While the ransom demand may be high, the alternative impact can also be devastating.
When the global aluminium producer Norsk Hydro was attacked in 2019, it cost the firm around Â£45m, and its profits in the immediate aftermath plummeted by 82%, reported Reuters.
Norsk Hydro refused to pay the demand, which would arguably have been cheaper - but it did have insurance.
A spokesman for the ABI said insurers do require that ""reasonable precautions"" are taken to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding in the first place, just as cars and houses require security measures in place to deter thieves.
""Some might argue that any insurance that covers against a criminal act could lull the policyholder into a false sense of security,"" he said.
Prof Martin said he did not think that banning ransomware insurance claims would necessarily solve the problem.
""But it's worth a serious piece of consultation because if we continue as we are, things will get worse,"" he said.",Yes
354,43,malware,Malware hits millions of Android phones,8 July 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36744925,"Up to 10 million Android smartphones have been infected by malware that generates fake clicks for adverts, say security researchers.
The software is also surreptitiously installing apps and spying on the browsing habits of victims.
The malware is currently making about $300,000 (Â£232,000) a month for its creators, suggests research.
The majority of phones that have been compromised by the malicious software are in China.
A spike in the number of phones infected by the malware was noticed separately by security companies Checkpoint and Lookout. The malware family is called Shedun by Lookout but Hummingbad by Checkpoint
In a blogpost, Checkpoint said it had obtained access to the command-and-control servers that oversee infected phones which revealed that Hummingbad was now on about 10 million devices. China, India, the Philippines and Indonesia top the list of nations with most phones infected by the software.
Hummingbad is a type of malware known as a rootkit that inserts itself deep inside a phone's operating system to help it avoid detection and to give its controllers total control over the handset.
The ability to control phones remotely has been used to click on ads to make them seem more popular than they actually are. The access has also been used to install fake versions of popular apps or spread programs the gang has been paid to promote.
""It can remain persistent even if the user performs a factory reset,"" wrote Kristy Edwards from Lookout in a blogpost. ""It uses its root privileges to install additional apps on to the device, further increasing ad revenue for the authors and defeating uninstall attempts.""
Ms Edwards said the recent spike in infections could be driven by the gang behind the malware adding more functions or using their access to phones for different purposes.
The malware gets installed on handsets by exploiting loopholes in older versions of the Android operating system known as KitKat and JellyBean. The latest version of Android is known as Marshmallow.
In a statement, Google said: """"We've long been aware of this evolving family of malware and we're constantly improving our systems that detect it. We actively block installations of infected apps to keep users and their information safe.""
Google released the latest security update for Android this month and it tackled more than 108 separate vulnerabilities in the operating system. So far this year, security updates for Android have closed more than 270 bugs.",Yes

Some of the software showed an animation or messages. Others invited the infected user to play a game.
Many of the viruses were created by ""happy hackers"" rather than organised criminals, said cybersecurity expert and curator Mikko Hypponen.
The malware all dates from the 1980s and 1990s.
The versions online have all been stripped of their destructive capabilities, but show the messages they would have displayed within emulator windows.
Much of the collection is mischievous and colourful in nature, but there was also more sinister malware around.
""I only chose interesting viruses,"" Mr Hypponen said of his picks.
His personal favourite is a virus called Casino, which overwrote a crucial part of the computer's file system but took a copy of personal files and then offered the user the opportunity to win them back in a game of Jackpot.
""Casino was a real problem,"" Mr Hypponen, who works at security firm F-Secure, told the BBC.
""At the time the advice was, you lose nothing by playing. In the early 1990s very few people had back-ups so you had lost your files anyway.""
He said he was surprised by the number of people who felt nostalgic about the old malware.

They told US media that the FBI and CIA were co-ordinating the inquiry after Wikileaks published thousands of files.
These carried claims that the CIA had developed ways to listen in on smartphone and smart TV microphones.
The CIA, FBI and White House have declined to comment on the authenticity of the files leaked on Tuesday.
A CIA spokesperson told the BBC on Wednesday: ""The American public should be deeply troubled by any Wikileaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries.
""Such disclosures not only jeopardise US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.""
CIA faces huge problem over malware claims
CIA hack:  Should we be worried?
On Wednesday, the US officials - who spoke on the condition of anonymity - told US media that the criminal investigation was looking into how the files came into Wikileaks' possession.
The inquiry would also try to establish whether the disclosure was a breach from inside or outside the CIA, the officials added.
The CIA has not confirmed whether the documents - said to date between 2013 to 2016 - are real.
But one of its former chiefs was concerned by their publication.
""If what I have read is true, then this seems to be an incredibly damaging leak in terms of the tactics, techniques, procedures and tools that were used by the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct legitimate foreign intelligence,"" ex-CIA director Michael Hayden told the BBC.
""In other words, it's made my country and my country's friends less safe.""
Several of the tech firms whose products have been allegedly compromised by the CIA gave their first reactions on Wednesday.
Apple said it had already addressed some of the vulnerabilities.
""The technology built into today's iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we're constantly working to keep it that way,"" it said.
Samsung - whose F8000 series of televisions was reportedly compromised - said that ""protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung"".
The leaks also claimed that the CIA had created malware to target PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
""We are aware of the report and are looking into it,"" a spokesman from Microsoft said.
Google has also reacted to claims that the CIA was able to ""penetrate, infest and control"" Android phones due to its discovery and acquisition of ""zero day"" bugs - previously unknown flaws in the operating system's code.
""As we've reviewed the documents, we're confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities,"" the firm told the news site Recode.
""Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections. We've always made security a top priority and we continue to invest in our defences.""
The World Wide Web Foundation - which campaigns for internet privacy - said the US government needed to issue a detailed response.
The Wikileaks claims are a prominent talking point in China's media, with many outlets warning Chinese citizens to take extra safety precautions.
Influential regional daily Chengdu Commercial Daily tells readers to ""update device software, don't leave TVs on standby, and don't read confidential documents on your phone"".
Nationalist newspaper Global Times says that the report ""shows the need for cyber rules"".
Russian media have also given extensive coverage to the claims.
Russia's English-language channel RT was quick to point to suggestions that the revelations ""could be used to prove that allegations of Russian hacking are actually a secret US plot"".

The ""stealthy"" Linux/moose botnet has one goal: infecting connected devices with malware in order to create and sell social media credibility.
Researchers have been tracking the botnet since 2015.
Now they have new research into what they call the ""ego market"" for fake online fame the botnet is feeding.
Canadian researchers Masarah-Cynthia Paquet-Clouston, a criminologist with the University of Montreal, and Olivier Bilodeau, with cybersecurity consultancy firm  GoSecure, are behind the award-winning research into the lucrative world of buying and selling ""followers"" and ""likes"" on social media networks.
Ms Paquet-Clouston said it is a global marketplace, with buyers from ""Brazil, Kuwait, China, everywhere. It seems to be worldwide.""
So who is seeking out all this fake online credibility and profile?
Accounts of aspiring celebrities and models, small businesses, and online retailers are those typically buying batches of ""likes"" openly advertised for sale online.
Average people are also paying to inflate their social media presence.
""There are a lot, a lot, a lot of just common people looking for fame,"" she said.
Because so many of the accounts that bought the fake likes were ""highly self-centered,"" they dubbed it the ""ego market"".
Ms Paquet-Clouston also said the fraud scheme being run by the Linux/moose botnet creators is an almost perfect crime, with no direct victims and a lot of potential profitability.
The average price for 1,000 Instragram follows is $15.98 (Â£12.80), although the researchers note there is a huge pricing range.
Creating fake social media accounts that then like and follow other accounts is not illegal but it goes against the terms of service of social media networks like Instagram. The purchase of Facebook and Instagram likes and Twitter followers is openly advertised online.
""What's illegal and criminal is doing it through a botnet, through infected devices,"" Ms Paquet-Clouston said.
The botnet can take advantage of all kinds of connected devices like routers, even ""smart"" appliances like fridges, toasters, and coffeemakers because, unlike most home computers, they lack antivirus and security software.
The malicious program got its name because the file containing its attack code is called elan - French for moose.
Ms Paquet-Clouston and Mr Bilodeau hope that their research will spur law enforcement and hosting providers to do more to target this criminal scheme.
""If we don't raise people's awareness on social media fraud, there's a demand and there's a supply and it's likely to continue,"" said Ms Paquet-Clouston.
They next part of their research is looking for online actors behind the botnet.",Yes

The malware may have been designed by a state-sponsored group.
It can disguise itself as benign files and does not operate in predictable ways, making it harder to detect.
Experts from Kaspersky Lab and Symantec said it allows the attacker to spy on infected computers.
In September last year, Kaspersky first detected the malware on an unspecified ""government organisation"" network.
Since then, the firm claims to have found evidence of Project Sauron at more than 30 organisations in Russia, Iran and Rwanda.
These were generally government, scientific, military, telecoms and financial organisations, according to Kaspersky.
Separately, Symantec said it had found the malware in other countries, including at an airline in China and an embassy in Belgium.
Project Sauron is able to disguise itself in a wide variety of ways - as files with names similar to those published by organisations like Microsoft, for example, and does not always use the same methods for sending data back to the attacker.
""The attackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always looking for patterns,"" the company notes in its report. ""Remove the patterns and the operation will be harder to discover.""
The malware can steal files, log all keystrokes and open a ""back door"" allowing wide-ranging access to the compromised computer, according to Symantec.
Project Sauron did not share any code with other known examples of similarly powerful malware, said Kaspersky's director of threat research Costin Raiu.
""It really stands out by itself as something very, very sophisticated,"" he told the BBC.
Mr Raiu also pointed out that two of the malware's victims had been infected with other highly sophisticated malicious programs. One victim was found to have Regin spyware on their systems, for example.
""This would suggest that the actor behind Project Sauron is perhaps different,"" suggested Mr Raiu.
One aspect of Project Sauron that demonstrates the malware's sophistication is its ability to steal sensitive data - such as encryption keys - from computers that are not actually connected to the internet.
This is known as ""jumping the air-gap"".
For this, Project Sauron relies on an infected USB drive being inserted into the target computer.
A hidden cache of files on the drive is then able to deposit malware on to that PC.
It is not yet clear how the attackers would have used this method to control an air-gapped computer, but they believe it might have been via a ""zero day"" - previously undetected - exploit that they have not yet found.
""We believe it was probably deployed in rare, hard-to-catch instances,"" notes the Kaspersky report.
Project Sauron is characteristic of state-sponsored style malware, according to cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley.
""These are very stealthy, insidious attacks that can lurk in the background for years gathering information,"" he told the BBC.
""We have seen the steady progression and evolution of these sorts of attacks. As governments try to protect themselves and get clued up, it is essentially an arms race.""",Yes
360,49,malware,Huge spam and malware network goes offline,13 June 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36519044,"One of the biggest networks of spam-sending computers in the world has gone quiet, puzzling experts, internet security firms have said.
For years the Necurs botnet has distributed junk mail and malware for many different groups of cyber-thieves.
But the amount of malicious traffic emerging from Necurs has now dwindled to almost nothing.
It is not clear what has caused the slowdown and whether traffic will return to previously high levels.
One of the first signs of the disruption was seen earlier this month when email messages spreading the Dridex banking trojan and Locky ransomware caught by security firms dried up.
Typically, millions of messages bearing these malicious programs are sent out every week,  Proofpoint said in a blogpost.
However, the flood of messages ""essentially stopped"" last week, it said. Investigations revealed that these messages typically travelled via the Necurs botnet which was found to have gone largely offline.
The Necurs botnet is believed to be made up of about six million compromised Windows machines, many of which were enrolled when their owners inadvertently fell victim to a form of malware known as a rootkit.
Analysis of some of the machines known to be part of Necurs shows that its core administration systems have disappeared, said Proofpoint.
""Data from a variety of sources show that Necurs bots are actively looking for a new command and control (C&C) system, but we have no evidence that the Necurs botmaster has been able to retake control of the botnet.""
A botnet's C&C system helps the network keep running and co-ordinates the distribution of any spam or malware being sent out via the global collection of computers.
Security researchers who monitor botnets and the groups that operate them said the cause of the shutdown remained a mystery.
""We cannot confirm how the botnet was brought down yet,"" Joonho Sa, a researcher for FireEye, told tech news site Motherboard.",Yes
361,50,malware,Malware-infected USB sticks posted to Australian homes,21 September 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37431335,"USB sticks containing harmful malware have been left in Australian letterboxes, police in Victoria have warned.
Residents of Pakenham, a suburb of Melbourne, have reportedly found the unmarked sticks in the boxes.
Plugging them into a computer triggers fraudulent media-streaming service offers, as well as other malware, the force said in a statement.
The devices are ""extremely harmful"" and should not be used, police say.
It is not uncommon for USB sticks to be used to carry and transmit destructive malware and viruses to computers.
Cybersecurity experts have called the technology ""critically flawed"", and in 2014 demonstrated to the BBC how any USB device could be used to infect a computer without the user's knowledge.
Berlin-based researchers Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell said a device that appeared to be completely empty could still contain a virus.
Stuxnet, one of the most sophisticated known pieces of malware, was deployed to attack Iranian nuclear centrifuges. It is believed to have been carried on an infected USB stick.
The virus infected the internal network of computers running Windows, and attacked Siemens industrial control software in order to over-ride the system.
Andrew Tierney, consultant at cybersecurity firm Pen Test Partners, said the use of infected USB sticks to target households was very rare.
""However, it's still a common form of attacking businesses, where the gains are much greater,"" he said.
""Most cybercriminals are looking for volume, so it's much easier to get hold of people's information by phishing. It's unclear whether the devices were sent in the post, but putting a USB stick in someone's letterbox by visiting the property and potentially getting your fingerprints on them creates a much greater risk of getting caught.""
The University of Illinois conducted an experiment earlier this year, dropping 297 USB drives around its campus. Had the sticks been infected, the attack would have had an estimated success rate of between 45% and 98%, the study found.
""You'd be surprised at how many people would fall for plugging an unknown USB stick into their computer. Some users may become distrustful at the stage only when the software asks them to download a program, but Word files can still be harmful,"" said Mr Tierney.",Yes
362,51,malware,Malware parasites feed on PerezHilton.com gossip fans,11 May 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36266632,"The gossip news site PerezHilton.com has exposed recent visitors to malware, according to a cybersecurity alert.
California-based Cyphort Labs said that it had detected ads placed on the site being used to spread harmful code on two separate visits during one week.
The celebrity scandal site has not yet commented but was known to have suffered a similar problem last year.
Experts suggested users install ad-blocking plug-ins to defend themselves.
The phenomenon is known as ""malvertising"", and users do not have to click on the ads to find their device infected.
PerezHilton.com is far from being the only publisher to have hosted the threat.
Cyphort identified 1,654 unique domains that had fallen victim to the parasitical attack in 2015, and said it believed it was on course to see more than 2,000 instances this year.
The New York Times, AOL and BBC.com are among other popular sites thought to have been hijacked in this way. since January.
""Malvertising is effective because users tend to trust mainstream, high-trafficked ""clean"" websites,"" security researcher Nick Bilogorskiy blogged.
""The attackers abuse this trust to infect them via third-party ad content.""
PerezHilton.com says it is visited by 12 million people every month.
In the first instance on 30 April, the firm said PerezHilton.com's ads caused users to download the Angler exploit kit, which is used to distribute a range of infections including ransomware.
Then on 2 May, it said a different type of exploit kit was spread via the site.
If the users had anti-virus software installed they may have been protected against some of the threats. But in many cases they would not have known they had been exposed.
Like many sites, PerezHilton.com does not check each advert that appears on its pages but instead relies on third parties to place them, sharing the revenue they generate.
""The only organisations which understand the full scale of the threat are the advertising networks themselves, and they don't want to draw attention to their own failure to vet their clients,"" commented Dr Steven Murdoch, a security expert at University College London.
Cyphort noted that users could protect themselves by installing ad-blocking extensions for their web browser.
Dr Murdoch concurred but questioned whether this was a long-term solution.
""Ad-blockers offer a temporary mitigation against these problems but if everyone starts using them the current business model of the web will no longer be sustainable,"" he said.
""Other options for keeping the web running include asking users to pay for services - subscriptions - but few websites have been able to make this work.""",Yes
363,52,malware,Home working increases cyber-security fears,1 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55824139,"Peter says that the cyber-attacks on his company are relentless.
""We see tens of different hacking attacks every single week. It is never ending.""
A senior computer network manager for a global financial services company, Peter (who did not want to give his surname, or the name of his employer, due to his firm's anxieties surrounding cyber-security), says they are bombarded from all directions.
""We see everything,"" he says. ""Staff get emails sent to them pretending to be from the service desk, asking them to reset their log-in passwords.
""We see workers being tricked into downloading viruses from hackers demanding ransoms, and we have even had employees sent WhatsApp messages pretending to be from the CEO, asking for money transfers.
""And having staff working from home during the lockdowns has just made it worse, as it is much harder to keep an eye on everyone.""
With one in three UK workers currently based exclusively at home, and the same level in the US, this remote working on a vast scale continues to be a major headache for the IT security bosses of companies large and small around the world.
And studies shows that many firms are not taking the issue as seriously as they should. For example, one in five UK home workers has received no training on cyber-security, according to a recent survey by legal firm Hayes Connor Solicitors.
The report also found that two out of three employees who printed potentially sensitive work documents at home admitted to putting the papers in their bins without shredding them first.
Meanwhile, a separate UK study last year found that 57% of IT decision makers believe that remote workers will expose their firm to the risk of a data breach.
""In the rush and panic to set remote working practices up, even simple data protection practices were ignored,"" says Christine Sabino, a senior associate at Hayes Connor.
""Companies did not provide additional security relating to computers, electronic communication, phone communication.""
So what can both companies and home working staff do to make things as safe and secure as possible?
Ted Harrington, a San Diego-based cyber-security specialist, and author of Hackable: How To Do Application Security Right, says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop. While many larger companies may well have done this, not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so, but Mr Harrington stresses its importance.
""Supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned, controlled and configured by the company,"" he says. ""This alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right, and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants.""
Definitely don't have staff using their personal computers for work, says Sam Grubb, an Arkansas-based cyber-security consultant, and author of forthcoming book How Cybersecurity Really Works.
""The main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it, nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it,"" he says.
""So while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free, your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing.
""This makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen. This might affect the work you are doing, or in a worst-case scenario, lead to the compromise of co-workers' devices, or other company devices such as servers.""
Mr Harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a VPN or virtual private network, so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firm's servers and everyone else in the company.
Mr Grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how VPNs work. ""A VPN is like a tunnel between two cities,"" he says.
""Instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers, lions and bears, you drive through the underground tunnel, where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side.""
However, even with work laptops, VPNs and the latest cyber-security software systems in place, staff can still make damaging mistakes, such as falling prey to a ""phishing"" email - a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data.
Currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to Covid-19, or invited to have the vaccine. They ask the recipient to clink on the link, which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
For this reason, both Mr Harrington and Mr Grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cyber-security training.
""Firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face,"" says Mr Grubb.
Ms Sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit. She says, for example, that employees should avoid talking about work on social media, while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out.
With even the most cyber-security aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake, Mr Harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to.
""If an employee falls victim to an attack, make sure that they know a) who to contact, and b) that their outreach is welcome and won't result in termination,"" he says. ""You don't want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes.""
Tsedal Neeley, a professor of business administration from Harvard Business School who is an expert on remote working, agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cyber-security problems to. ""Engaging with their firm's IT/cyber-security experts is crucial,"" she says.
Peter, the computer network manager, says this engagement should be frequent. ""Users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100% confident about, and it does not hurt to ask your IT department. It is better to check than be compromised.""",Yes
364,53,malware,Independent blog site hit by malware,9 December 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35050226,"The Independent newspaper's blogging platform has been briefly compromised with malware that infects readers' computers, security experts have said.
Researchers from Trend Micro found blogs on the website had been modified to install malware known as Cryptesla on readers' devices.
The malware holds files on the host machine to ransom and demands a payment to restore them.
The Independent said it had removed all ads on the site while it investigated.
""It appears that an advert appearing on that blogsite may have included malware,"" said a spokesman for the newspaper.
""There is no suggestion or evidence that any of our users have been affected by this.""
The spokesman said the site affected was an old or ""legacy"" system that was now rarely visited.
According to Trend Micro, the ransomware has been present on the Independent blogs website since at least 21 November.
""We reported it to them on Tuesday - but, as of today, it is still happening,"" said Raimund Genes, chief technical officer at Trend Micro.
""Now we need to go public to warn people who are not using security software like ours.""
The malware exploits a security hole in Adobe Flash Player to install itself on a victim's computer.
Once downloaded, it sets about encrypting documents, rendering them useless without the key to decrypt them, for which it demands a ransom.
The vulnerability in Flash has since been patched, but anybody using an old version of the web browser plug-in could still be at risk.
""For a while on Tuesday, the malware didn't trigger. But that was not the Independent solving it, it was the attackers updating the malware with a new version,"" said Mr Genes.
""My advice is to update your Flash Player. Always do it immediately when it says an update is available, because Flash remains one of the main ways attackers can compromise a system.""
The spokesperson added that the media group was now looking into the incident.
""We are currently investigating third-party advertising suppliers that are used by our externally hosted blog platform Independent blogs, which is a separate entity to independent.co.uk,"" they said.
""Less than 0.2% of the Independent digital audience visited this separate, legacy blogsite in the entire month of November,"" the spokesman added.

365,54,malware,Guilty plea for Latvian malware maker,7 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34173422,"A Latvian man has pleaded guilty to creating malware that stole millions of dollars from online bank accounts.
Deniss Calovskis admitted in a New York court hearing that he had been hired to write part of the Gozi computer virus.
The code Calovskis wrote changed banking websites and helped make the virus more effective.
Gozi was first found in 2007 but remained active for years and is thought to have infected more than one million computers worldwide.
""I knew what I was doing was against the law,"" Calovskis said in court, answering charges of conspiring to commit computer intrusion.
Calovskis was extradited to the US from Latvia in February after lengthy negotiations between the two nations over the potential sentence he would serve.
Latvian government officials initially resisted calls to hand over Calovskis, saying US plans to sentence him to more than 60 years in jail did not represent ""proportionate punishment"".
A plea agreement on sentencing reached with lawyers representing Calovskis means he will not appeal against any jail sentence of two years or less.
It is not clear whether the 10 months Calovskis spent in jail in Latvia during the extradition row will count as part of the sentence he eventually receives.
He is scheduled to be sentenced on 14 December.
Two other men have been arrested in connection with the creation and administration of Gozi.

On 13 December, it disclosed that Orion had been compromised. It was used as a means to penetrate US government networks and companies including Intel.
It was later revealed that the product had also been compromised by malware from a suspected second perpetrator, adding a separate backdoor.
SolarWinds said industry experts were helping it investigate the attacks.
The Texas-based company provides computer network management tools to a wide variety of clients including British accountants Deloitte, US chip-maker Nvidia and the Californian cloud-computer software firm VMWare.
A UK security source told the BBC a small number of British organisations had probably been affected.
Some experts have warned it could take more than a year for organisations to determine whether attackers have penetrated their systems, stolen any data or installed backdoors.
Sean Koessel, from the cyber-security company Volexity, warned companies: ""Don't leave any stone unturned.""
""I could easily see it taking half a year or more to figure out, if not into the years, for some of these organisations,"" he told the Reuters news agency.
The identities of those responsible for the attacks on Orion remain unclear.
However, several US government officials and security experts have pointed the finger at Russia for being behind the more devastating ""Sunburst"" attack. The Kremlin has denied responsibility.
US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told Fox News: ""It's clearly a sophisticated intelligence operation and no doubt was done by a state actor. And we'll get around to attribution of that at a time and place of our choosing.""

Trustwave looked at how much cash typical cybercriminals spend and what their potential profits might be.
It estimated it would cost $5,900 (Â£3,860) to buy a ransomware kit that could return up to $90,000 in one month of operation.
Experts said people should take precautions and avoid paying up if they get hit.
Ransomware involves a malicious program infecting a machine, scrambling key files and then demanding the machine's owner pay cash before the data is unscrambled.
According to a report from Intel-owned security firm McAfee Labs, high-tech extortion schemes nearly doubled in the first three months of 2015.
""I was frankly stunned by the figures we got from this,"" said Karl Sigler, a threat intelligence specialist at Trustwave.
He said the company drew its figures from information available on hidden sites on Tor and discussion forums available on the wider web. Typically, he said, a ransomware scammer needs three separate tools to perpetrate their crimes - malware, an exploit kit and a pool of victims.
The service industry surrounding web crime had grown to such an extent, he said, that all these were available to buy online. It had found forums in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America peddling all three.
By spending about $5,900, criminals would get the ransomware malicious code, an online kit that acted as an administration system for an attack campaign and a ready source of victims from a compromised site.
If a criminal infected 10% of the 20,000 visitors to a compromised website each day and only 0.5% of those victims paid the $300 ransom being demanded, then one campaign could net a criminal about $90,000 a month, he said.
""The money is there and the economy is there,"" he said. ""If you lack the morals and ethics it can be easy to get into.""
Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said the virtual currency bitcoin has been key to the growth of ransomware.
""That's what really enabled the ransomware problem to explode,"" he said. ""Once the criminals were able to collect their ransom without getting caught, nothing was stopping them.""
The latest trend was for an affiliate model in which the maker of ransomware sells the code to someone else who then uses it.
The market had become so popular that gangs were now competing against each other fighting for market share.
""Almost all of them deliver the 'goods',"" said Mr Hypponen. ""If you pay, you will get your files back. Some even run support forums to help you recover.
""This is because they need good online reputation: otherwise nobody would pay,"" he said.
Mr Hypponen's advice to avoid falling victim was to take backups, ensure software is up-to-date, be suspicious of message attachments and run comprehensive security software.
""And,"" he said, ""don't pay money to these clowns unless you absolutely have to.""",Yes

Ransomware encrypts data on infected machines and only unscrambles it if victims pay a fee.
The authority said it was working with its computer security provider to apply a fix to its systems.
Chief information officer Judith Hetherington-Smith said only a small number of files were affected.
She said the authority took action once the malware was identified and shut its systems down.
This meant some services were affected, including libraries and online booking systems.
Mrs Hetherington-Smith said: ""People can only use pens and paper, we've gone back a few years.""
Talking about the attack, she said: ""It happened very quickly. Once we identified it we shut the network down, but some damage is always done before you get to that point - and some files have been locked by the software.
""A lot of the files will be available for us to restore from the back-up.""

The news came as Apple said it was going to make its Xcode program - the tool used to build apps for its operating system - easier to download in China, where the problem originated.
Some Chinese firms said slow download speeds behind the Great Firewall led them to seek locally held, bootlegged versions of Xcode that they did not know were infected with malware.
Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller said the firm would offer domestic downloads in China in a bid to speed up downloads and convince people to install only the official software.
App developers are not blocked from downloading the official version of Xcode. But censorship controls, along with low investment in infrastructure for international connections, make using services based outside China a painful process for some.
""In the US it only needs 25 minutes to download. China may take three times as long,"" Mr Schiller told Sina.cn.
The counterfeit versions served malware that infected apps built on them, allowing the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they controlled.
The US security firm Palo Alto Networks said it believed the number of infected apps was likely to be ""far greater"" than the few dozen initially thought. According to FireEye, another security company, the figure could be as high as 4,000.
The App Store had previously been almost entirely free of malware, and it was unclear how the altered code withstood Apple's app approval process, in which developers often wait a week for reviews of updates to their apps.
""These reviews are legendary for how particular Apple is,"" said Robert Walker, founder of mobile dating app Cuddli, who worked for Microsoft in China. ""Supposedly, a security review is part of that. But they missed this repeatedly over dozens of different applications. A huge mistake on their part.""
Security consultant Graham Cluley said: ""Apple security, for so long priding itself on the tight ship it maintains over apps that get into its App Store, has definitely suffered a bloody nose.
""However, let's not lose sight of the fact that malware appearing in Google's equivalent app store for Android is far from rare.""

The list includes Hyatt premises in Canada, the US, the UK, Jordan, Chile and Indonesia and involves almost half of its properties.
The firm is offering one year's free protection to people who used their cards in one of the compromised hotels.
The infection took place between August and December last year.
The Chicago-based Hyatt group has 627 properties in its portfolio. It said 250 hotels, all of which it manages directly, had been infected.
In a statement, Hyatt's global president of operations Chuck Floyd said that ""unauthorised access"" to payment card information - including the names of cardholders, card numbers and expiry dates - had been detected primarily in restaurants but also at spas, golf shops, parking and some front desks inside the hotel chain.
""We encourage you to remain vigilant and to review your payment card account statements closely,"" he said, adding that cards could now be used ""with confidence"" inside the hotel chain following the investigation.
Although he said the company had ""worked quickly"" with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to address the issue, the infection appeared to have gone unnoticed for about four months.
The period of risk for affected customers was between 30 July and 8 December 2015, Mr Floyd wrote.
Hyatt has now teamed up with a company called CSID, which specialises in identity protection and ""fraud restoration"" services, to offer one year's free coverage for those whose cards may have been compromised.

The software shares the cards with the virus's creators who then join the same game and try to fleece the victim.
The sneaky malware has been found lurking in software designed to help poker fans play better, said the security firm that found it.
The software also targets other useful information on a victim's computer such as login names and passwords.
The malware targets players of the Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker sites, said Robert Lipovsky, a security researcher at Eset, in a blogpost.
When it infects a machine, the software monitors the PC's activity and springs to life when a victim has logged in to either one of the two poker sites. It then starts taking screenshots of their activity and the cards they are dealt. Screenshots are then sent to the attacker.
The images show the hand the player has been dealt as well as their player ID. This, said Eset, allows the attacker to search the sites for that player and join their game. Using information about a victim's hand gives the attacker a significant advantage.
""We are unsure whether the perpetrator plays the games manually or in some automated way,"" wrote Mr Lipovsky.
Eset found the Windows malware lurking in some well-known file-sharing applications, PC utilities as well as several widely used poker calculators and player databases.

The credentials were found by security firm Palo Alto Networks while investigating suspicious activity on many Apple devices.
It uncovered a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iPhones.
The majority of people hit by KeyRaider are in China but Palo Alto said iPhone owners in 17 other nations had also been caught out.
The theft is believed to be the biggest ever involving Apple accounts, said Palo Alto in a blogpost outlining its findings.
User reports of unauthorised payments being made via iTunes accounts and of apps being installed unexpectedly alerted Palo Alto to a potential problem.
It found that an attacker had made changes to software used on jailbroken iPhones. A jailbroken iPhone is one that can run apps that are not sourced from the main Apple app store.
The main purpose of the booby-trapped software was to let people get apps and other Apple content without paying for them. The malicious version of the code, dubbed KeyRaider by Palo Alto, spied on transactions to scoop up login names, passwords and other credentials.
The stolen data was sent to a remote server run by the malicious hackers behind KeyRaider.
Apple's phones are the third most popular in China behind Huawei and Xiaomi, suggests research.
Security firm Symantec said iPhone-owners were taking a risk by jailbreaking their device because this can remove the security checks Apple introduced to thwart malicious apps.

374,63,malware,'Sophisticated' Android malware hits phones,21 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30143283,"Hundreds of thousands of Android phones have been infected with malware that uses handsets to send spam and buy event tickets in bulk.
Mobile security firm Lookout said the virus, called NotCompatible, was the most sophisticated it had seen.
The cyberthieves behind it had recently rewritten its core code to make it harder to defeat, it said.
Mobile malware aimed at smartphones is steadily getting more complex, said security company Wandera.
Jeremy Linden, a security analyst at Lookout, said: ""The group behind NotCompatible are operating on a different plane to the typical mobile malware maker.""
Usually, he said, mobile malware campaigns lasted only a couple of weeks but the NotCompatible creators had been operating for more than two years.
The bug first appeared in 2012 and was now on its third iteration, he said, adding that the latest version had been rewritten recently and was now as sophisticated as the malware aimed at desktop computers.
""They are successful enough to make it worth ripping out the back end of the malware to make it be much more stable and resistant to efforts to take it down,"" he said.
This latest version employed end-to-end encryption, peer-to-peer networking technologies and stealthy operating procedures to help it avoid being spotted and removed, he said.
Phones infected with NotCompatible were enrolled into a network that is now being rented out to any crime group that needs a ready source of Android users.
Mr Linden said compromised phones had been used in a variety of scams including sending spam, attacking Wordpress blogs and buying tickets for popular events in bulk that would then be resold at a significant profit.
""This is the most technically sophisticated threat we are facing and it's the most worrying to us,"" said Mr Linden.
NotCompatible is being spread via spam and websites seeded with booby-trapped downloads, he said and urged Android users to be wary of any app that required a security update to be installed before it was run.
Mobile malware was growing in popularity among cybercrime groups because smartphones were now so central to modern life, said Eldar Tuvey from mobile security monitoring firm Wandera
""We're definitely seeing the bad guys focus their attention on mobiles,"" he said. ""That's because more time is now spent on apps on phones than desktops.""
While Android had long been a target of malware makers, the appearance of the Wirelurker and Masque malware families that both targeted Apple gadgets showed the growing confidence of cybercriminals, he said.
They were keen to get a foothold on a phone so they could harvest useful data that they could sell or use to make phishing emails look more plausible, or to lever open accounts for social networks or other web-based services.
With 70% of people reusing passwords across many different sites and services, it was no surprise that criminals regularly got access to these accounts, he said.
Many were aided by ""leaky"" apps that passed around log-in names, email addresses and other credentials in unencrypted text, said Mr Tuvey.
""The trend is only moving in one direction,"" he said. ""The criminals are sharing information between themselves and they are learning about how to improve the efficiency of their attacks.""",Yes

The Finnish security firm F-Secure said clicking on the malware links also enabled infiltrators to wipe accounts on the gaming shop, Steam.
Twitch is advising users not to use links from unknown sources.
The site, which was recently bought by Amazon for $970m (Â£597m) has more than 55 million unique monthly viewers.
The vulnerability originates from an automated account which, according to F-Secure, ""bombards channels and invites viewers to participate in a weekly raffle for a chance to win things such as 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' items"".
If viewers take the bait, they are invited to fill in their name and email address which then allows the malicious software to gain control, allowing it to:
A spokesman for Twitch told the BBC that the vulnerability was the ""first instance"" he had seen, but that the site would ""remind our community about not clicking on links from unknown sources just like they wouldn't on other social media sites"".

376,65,malware,Facebook porn: Malware warning over video,3 February 2015,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-31096068,"If someone shares a porn video on Facebook, beware.
The latest threat to users involves a fake Flash Player update which pops up during a preview of a pornographic video.
Once you click on the link to update your video player, malware (the name given to malicious software), downloads onto your computer.
This Trojan horse software gives the creator of the malware remote access to your computer.
They can then download viruses onto your computer.
Security researcher Mohammad Faghani alerted users to the threat in a post on the Full Disclosure blog, which flags up network vulnerabilities.
""The Trojan tags the infected user's friends with an enticing post,"" he explained.
Faghani warned that the malware then tags up to 20 friends of the victim in the malicious post, thus leading to a larger number of those who could be affected.
He believes it could ""infect more than 110,000 users in two days"".
Faghani also said the malware was able to hijack keyboard and mouse movement.
In response, Facebook said it was aware of the problem and was working to block it.
In a statement issued to security news website Threatpost, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We use a number of automated systems to identify potentially harmful links and stop them from spreading.
""In this case, we're aware of these malware varieties, which are typically hosted as browser extensions and distributed using links on social media sites.
""We are blocking links to these scams, offering cleanup options, and pursuing additional measures to ensure that people continue to have a safe experience on Facebook.""

It said bogus ads for shoes briefly appeared among the selection of banners displayed on DailyMail.com.
Instead of online shops, it said, the ads linked to malware that could expose computers to ""ransomware"".
Ransomware encrypts files on a victim's computer and asks for a payment to decrypt them again.
The practice is known as ""malvertising"".
Security company Malwarebytes said it had made the discovery last week and had published a report about its findings online.
A spokesman for the Daily Mail later said that it had not been contacted by Malwarebytes about its findings in advance.
However, the BBC has seen evidence that the security company did in fact try to contact the newspaper about the issue last Friday.
By Monday morning, the security company said that the fake ads had been removed.
Malwarebytes said the banners, purporting to be for an online shoe retailer, were published via a bogus ad server.
From there, they were said to have been distributed via an advertising network that presents ads to readers on the Daily Mail's website.
If a user clicked on one of the ads, said the security firm, they would be redirected to a well known piece of malware called the Angler Exploit Kit, which attacks vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash.
There are various ways to protect yourself from ransomware, according to Tony Berning, senior manager at software company Opswat.
""To protect against ransomware, users must back up their data regularly,"" he said.
""In addition to this, an important defence against ransomware is the use of anti-virus engines to scan for threats.
""With over 450,000 new threats emerging daily, anti-malware engines need to detect new threats continuously, and will inevitably address different threats at different times,"" Mr Berning said.",Yes
378,67,malware,Porn sites hit by malware hidden in adverts,25 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34356950,"Security firm Malwarebytes says a campaign of malware hidden inside online ads which hit search engine Yahoo earlier this year has now also appeared on adult websites.
The advertising, apparently for a service called Sex Messenger, also contained tools for identifying whether the user was genuine rather than a bot.
It appeared on porn site xhamster, one of the world's most visited domains.
However the firm said porn sites are no more dangerous than mainstream ones.
The ad has now been removed.
The malware, which also made use of the security of cloud-based platforms to hide what it was doing, worked by directing the user to a fraudulent page once it had determined that they were running Microsoft's Internet Explorer and had identified the device's security settings.
So-called ""malvertising"" often installs ransomware on to a victim's machine. It loads a page containing false accusations of criminal activity and instructions for paying a fine.
""These efforts ensure that only real users will get to see the exploit kit landing page therefore excluding honeypots and security researchers alike,"" wrote Malwarebytes security consultant Jerome Segura in a blog post.
Although in this case the ad was popping up so often that researchers were able to study it after all.
Xhamster is currently ranked the 71st most visited website in the world by web analytics firm Alexa and attracts hundreds of millions of monthly users.
But the online porn industry does invest in security, Mr Segura added.
""There's this idea that adult sites are more dangerous to visit than 'regular' sites,"" he told Tech Week Europe.
""I don't believe it's entirely true especially for the top sites because they do dedicate a lot of resources to fighting fraud and malware.
""Based on what we have seen in the past months as far as malvertising goes, we have seen just as many top mainstream publishers as pornographic ones.""

Shylock was said to have been installed on more than 30,000 machines worldwide, but mostly targeted bank accounts of people living in the UK.
As ever, the NCA urged the public to make sure their security software was fully up-to-date.
The action follows a similar effort led by US authorities last month.
The Zeus botnet was said to have infected more than a million computers worldwide.
The US is seeking a Russian man, Evgeniy Bogachev, in connection with the operation.
This latest action has been led by UK intelligence services, working in conjunction with security experts based in The Hague.
""The NCA is co-ordinating an international response to a cybercrime threat to businesses and individuals around the world,"" said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit.
""This phase of activity is intended to have a significant effect on the Shylock infrastructure and demonstrates how we are using partnerships across sectors and across national boundaries to cut cybercrime impacting the UK.""
The Shylock malware - so named because passages from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice were found within its code - affected computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Authorities were able to seize computer servers that were controlling Shylock.
However, cybercriminals are often quick to react when disrupted by server seizures.
In the case of Zeus, authorities predicted it would take just two weeks for criminals to reorganise themselves and restart the operation.",Yes
380,69,malware,Europol kills off shape-shifting 'Mystique' malware,9 April 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32218381,"Shapeshifting malware that changes its identity up to 19 times a day to avoid detection has been deactivated by Europe's Cybercrime Centre and the FBI.
At its height in September 2014 the malware, called Beebone, was controlling 100,000 computers a day.
Criminals used it to help steal passwords and download other programs to the infected computers.
Around 12,000 victims are being asked to use new online clean-up tools to remove it.
Once on a victim's computer, Beebone operates like a downloader application that can be controlled by the suspected criminal gangs behind the program.
It was used to force victims' PCs to fetch other malware from the internet including password stealers, ransomware, rootkits, and programs designed to take down legitimate websites.
Computer security firm Intel Security, which helped law enforcement agencies to stop the malware, said it had seen Beebone change its identity up to 19 times per day to avoid more traditional ""signature detection"" anti-virus methods.
Intel Security's chief technology officer Raj Samani told the BBC: ""Beebone is highly sophisticated. It regularly changes its unique identifier, downloading a new version of itself, and can detect when it is being isolated, studied, or attacked.
""It can successfully block attempts to kill it.""
Operation Beebone was carried out by the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce set up by the European Union to tackle cross-border internet crime. The team finally managed to tackle the malware by stopping it from connecting to servers on the net used to control and send it instructions.
Nearly 100 .com, .net, and .org domains have been ""sinkholed"" - the process by which traffic meant for specific IP addresses is redirected from suspected criminal-controlled sites to the investigating authorities. This allows detectives to ""see"" how the application behaves and to intercept requests for further instructions by the malicious software.
The FBI assisted in redirecting traffic from most of the sites being used by the gangs because they were operated from the United States and are under US jurisdiction.
The operation also involved private security firms Intel Security, Kaspersky Labs and Shadowserver. The taskforce now believes it has isolated the morphing malware so criminals can no longer make use of it.
Head of operations at the European Cybercrime Centre, Paul Gillen told the BBC the agency would now look at whether those behind the attacks could be identified and brought to justice. He admitted the solution the taskforce had found was not a permanent one: ""We can't sinkhole these domains forever. We need those infected to clean up their computers as soon as possible.""
Several security vendors have created a free tool to remove the Beebone malware including F-Secure, TrendMicro, Symantec and Intel Security.
But victims need to first realise they have the malware on their systems before they can download the removal tool.
Raj Samani said those who have the malware ""will be notified by their internet service provider"".
ISPs in each affected country will be handed a list of suspected victims to contact by the taskforce.
The Beebone malware was described by the Europol taskforce as ""very sophisticated"". Some security experts believe the consequences of the attack could have been much worse.
Portcullis Security in the UK advises various British government departments on cybersecurity issues. Its director, Paul Docherty, told the BBC:
""The fact that it [the malware] is complicated suggests that it could be used for more targeted attacks. If those responsible were able to harness similar difficult-to-detect code they could potentially move the point of attack from home users to corporate users or other entities which typically hold large amounts of sensitive, valuable data.""
Mr Docherty said computer users should have anti-virus software installed and that it was essential that they kept it up-to-date. He warned against members of the  public underestimating how valuable their computer might be to criminal hackers.
""There is still a general consensus that, It won't happen to me, I have nothing anyone could want. However, when you discuss with people what they actually use their technology for this changes very quickly.""
The total number of computers infected by Beebone is relatively modest compared with some recent malware take-downs like GameOver Zeus. Security experts believe this is because the malware was not spread by mass emailing potential victims with poisoned internet links, an approach known as spearphishing. Intel Security said Beebone  was more commonly spread through hardware like USB drives, or data discs.
Now remaining victims are being asked to clean up their computers as soon as possible.
Mr Samani said it is likely those who have Beebone on their computers ""were likely to have a lot of other malware too because of the nature of Beebone as a malware downloader itself"".
But there is another good reason why victims will want to move on quickly, says Mr Docherty: ""Clean-up after infection could be complicated, as this [criminal] campaign has used a constantly changing (polymorphic) dropper to implant malware, it is possible that it has also installed code of a similar nature to re-enable access to the systems following clean-up.""",Yes
381,70,malware,Apple malware affects mostly Chinese users,6 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29928751,"Malware has bypassed Apple's safety controls by taking advantage of a process used by employers to add apps to workers' iPhones and iPads.
US-based Palo Alto Networks said WireLurker appeared to have originated in China and was mostly infecting devices there.
The malware first targets Mac computers via a third-party store before copying itself to iOS devices.
Researchers warn it steals information and can install other damaging apps.
""WireLurker is unlike anything we've ever seen in terms of Apple iOS and OS X malware,"" said Ryan Olson, Palo Alto Network's intelligence director.
""The techniques in use suggest that bad actors are getting more sophisticated when it comes to exploiting some of the world's best-known desktop and mobile platforms.""
WireLurker has the ability to transfer from Apple's Mac computer to mobile devices through a USB cable.
The security firm said the malware was capable of stealing ""a variety of information"" from mobile devices it infects and regularly requested updates from the attackers' control server.
""This malware is under active development and its creator's ultimate goal is not yet clear,"" the company added.
Apple has issued a brief statement.
""We are aware of malicious software available from a download site aimed at users in China, and we've blocked the identified apps to prevent them from launching,"" it said.
""As always, we recommend that users download and install software from trusted sources.""
According to Palo Alto Networks, WireLurker was first noticed in June when a developer at the Chinese firm Tencent realised there were suspicious files and processes happening on his Mac and iPhone.
Further inquiries revealed a total of 467 Mac programs listed on the Maiyadi App Store had been compromised to include the malware, which in turn had been downloaded 356,104 times as of 16 Oct.
Infected software included popular games including Angry Birds, The Sims 3, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2.
Once the malware was on the Mac, it communicated with a command-and-control server to check if it needed to update its code, and then waited until an iPhone, iPad or iPod was connected.
When an iOS device was connected the malware would check if it was jailbroken - a process used by some to remove some of Apple's restrictions.
If it was jailbroken, WireLurker backed up the device's apps to the Mac, where it repackaged them with malware, and then installed the infected versions back on to the iOS machine.
If it was not jailbroken - which is the case for most iOS devices - WireLurker took advantage of a technique created by Apple to allow businesses to install special software on their staff's handsets and tablets.
This involved placing infected apps on the device that had been signed with a bogus ""enterprise certificate"" - code added to a product that is supposed to prove it comes from a trustworthy source.
To ensure the devices accepted this certificate, a permissions request was made to pop up on the targeted iOS device on the user's first attempt to run an infected app.
It simply asked for permission to run the app, but if the user clicked ""continue"" it installed code called a ""provisioning profile"", which told the iOS device it could trust any other app that had the same enterprise certificate.
Palo Alto Networks remarked that while this technique was not a new concept, it was the only known example of it being used to target non-jailbroken iOS devices in the wild.
Once active, the malware is used to upload information about the machine to the hackers, including phone numbers from its Contacts app, and the user's Apple ID.
Different versions of WireLurker also automatically installed new apps on the devices - including a video game and a comic book reader.
While these were innocuous, experts warn they could represent a test run for other more damaging software.
""People have got very used to iOS being secure and there is a danger they may be complacent about the risk this presents,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.
""Now Apple knows what it's looking for, it should be able to shut it down relatively easily. But it shows that people are trying to attack Apple's operating system and the firm can't take security for granted.""
News of the attack comes after tech giant Apple's iCloud storage service in China was attacked by hackers trying to steal user information just last month.
Chinese web monitoring group Greatfire.org said that hackers intercepted data and potentially gained access to passwords, messages, photos and contacts. They believed the Beijing government was behind the move.
But the Chinese government denied the claims and was backed by state-owned internet provider China Telecom, which said the accusation was ""untrue and unfounded"".
China is home to the world's biggest smartphone market and Apple saw its iPhone sales there jump 50% in the April to June quarter from a year earlier.

After an update, essential components in two Panda Security antivirus programs became corrupted, leading them to be mistakenly identified as malign and quarantined.
Panda said a fix had been released and warned that rebooting affected systems could exacerbate the issue.
It asked those affected to get in touch so it could help fix their machines.
One security expert noted the irony. ""People's first response is to turn [their computer] off and back on again, but in this case it seems like the wrong thing to do,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University.
The ""last thing"" people would expect to cause their computers to break down was its security software, he said.
Panda Security said that the signature file in both its PCOP and its Retail 2015 packages became corrupted.
""The signature file was repaired immediately. Additionally, a solution for all affected products has been automatically deployed. However, in certain environments it is possible for the incident to persist.""
It added a list of steps that affected users could take to ensure that their system was clear of the issue.
Prof Woodward said the episode was ""not a great advert for Panda"". He said he had heard of some companies losing the use of multiple computers to the issue. He added that data loss was a risk if machines were rebooted.
But Panda Security said it was helping people whose machines had stopped working to restore them and that it had no evidence anyone had experienced permanent data loss as a result of the issue.
A Panda Security spokeswoman said: ""We have solved 90% of the incidents, and support is being given in real time to the ones that still have some issues.""

384,73,malware,Android Mazar malware that can 'wipe phones' spread via SMS,16 February 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35586446,"A Danish security company has detected an attempt to spread a powerful form of Android malware via text messages.
Mazar can gain administrator rights on phones, allowing it to wipe handsets, make calls or read texts.
However, it will not install on phones where the language is set to Russian.
Additionally, users would have to have unchecked a default setting on Android devices that ensures software may only be installed from trusted sources.
Security firm Heimdal thinks the malicious texts could have been sent to over 100,000 phones in Denmark, though it is not sure whether users in other countries may have received the messages.
This is believed to be the first time Mazar has been detected in widespread, real world attacks.
In the examples studied by Heimdal, users receive an innocuous-looking text providing a link to what looks like a multimedia message.
This link downloads Tor software, which enables anonymous internet connections, to the phone.
Afterwards, the malware itself is downloaded through Tor in an apparent effort to hide the source of the malicious software itself.
One interesting feature of Mazar is that it cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with ""Russian"" selected as the operating system's language.
Similar controls have been detected in PC malware in the past, according to Morten Kjaersgaard, chief executive of Heimdal.
Infected phones are at risk from a range of threats - from attackers secretly monitoring devices to reading a user's texts or even erasing all personal data from the handset.
Or, the attacker could simply send a lot of texts to premium numbers.
""It can do a lot of damage - maybe running up a big phone bill for which the customer would be liable,"" Mr Kjaersgaard told the BBC.
""It's not like when you use your credit card and there's an international standard for banks covering [fraud].""
Heimdal tested phones running Android Kitkat (version 4.4) but Mr Kjaersgaard believes the issue is likely to affect all prior versions as well.
Later versions of the operating system have not been tested.
The advice to users is to never tap on web links in text messages from unfamiliar phone numbers and to be cautious of links even if the message appears to be from a known contact since sometimes this can be spoofed.
""Over one billion devices are protected with Google Play which conducts 200 million security scans of devices per day,"" a Google spokeswoman said.
""Fewer than 1% of Android devices had a Potentially Harmful App installed in 2014, and fewer than 0.15% of devices that only install from Google Play had a Potentially Harmful App installed,"" she added.",Yes

Fraud prevention organisation Cifas said fraudsters were sharing tips and getting more sophisticated in their attempts to steal money.
Cases of a particular scam targeting shoppers, which often spikes at Christmas, have tripled this year.
Criminals harvest personal information then buy items in someone else's name.
The so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff.
Criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. Online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers.
Cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. This is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines.
Criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again.
There were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from January to September recorded by Cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019.
There was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones.
Cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies.
Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""We often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so I would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police.""
Last month, banking trade body UK Finance warned criminals were using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails.

386,75,malware,Webcam hacker spied on sex acts with BlackShades malware,8 October 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34475151,"A Leeds-based hacker used a notorious piece of malware called BlackShades to spy on people via their webcams.
Investigators from the National Crime Agency found images on the computer of Stefan Rigo, 34, including ones of people involved in sexual activity, some of whom were on Skype at the time.
Rigo was arrested in November last year during an international investigation.
He has been given a 20-week suspended sentence and placed on the sex offenders' register for seven years.
Rigo targeted a variety of victims after gaining remote access to their computers' webcams.
Incriminating images on his computer were discovered after a forensic examination.
Out of 14 confirmed individuals he spied on - roughly half were people he knew personally, an NCA spokesman told the BBC.
At a hearing in July, Rigo pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism and another computer-related offence.
The court took Rigo's guilty plea into account when handing down the 20 week sentence. As well as being placed on the sex offenders register, Rigo will have to complete 200 hours of unpaid work within the next 12 months.
Investigators found and arrested Rigo after raiding two addresses in Leeds.
The hacker had used his ex-girlfriend's details to purchase BlackShades, a remote access trojan (RAT) which allows for a high level of surreptitious control over a victim's computer.
""The problem with RATs specifically is a lot of the time people don't know they're being affected,"" the NCA spokesman said.
""In the case of Stefan Rigo that we were looking at, his victims weren't aware.""
BlackShades has been around since 2010 and has been sold for as little as $40 (Â£26), explained Jens Monrad at cyber security firm FireEye.
""The application in itself is not that difficult to detect but typically the attackers will wrap some sort of exploit around the application,"" said Mr Monrad.
""Even with patches the victim will still be vulnerable so long as there is a hole in the operating system.""
Mr Monrad recommended that computer users be careful of clicking on suspicious links or downloading dubious email attachments.
The criminal market for webcam hacking tools is highly active, according to Mr Monrad, since malicious hackers are often able to exploit their victims after taking covert images of them.
There have also been cases in which hackers sold access to specific cameras.
Connected security cameras in buildings may be at risk too, though there are sometimes difficulties in publicly discussing how secure they are.
One researcher recently cancelled a forthcoming talk on the issue following legal pressure from the manufacturers of widely-used surveillance cameras.
Gianni Gnesa was due to discuss ""vulnerabilities found on major surveillance cameras and show how an attacker could used them to stay undetected"" at the HITB GSEC security conference in Singapore.
The Register reports that a legal threat from one, unnamed, manufacturer resulted in Gnesa withdrawing his presentation.",Yes
387,76,malware,Apple's App Store infected with XcodeGhost malware in China,21 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34311203,"Apple has said it is taking steps to remove malicious code added to a number of apps commonly used on iPhones and iPads in China.
It is thought to be the first large-scale attack on Apple's App Store.
The hackers created a counterfeit version of Apple's software for building iOS apps, which they persuaded developers to download.
Apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control.
Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks - which has analysed the malware dubbed XcodeGhost - said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into revealing information.
It added they could also read and alter information in compromised devices' clipboards, which would potentially allow them to see logins copied to and from password management tools.
Infected applications includes Tencent's hugely popular WeChat app, NetEase's music downloading app and Didi Kuaidi's Uber-like car hailing app.
Some of the affected apps - including the business card scanner CamCard - are also available outside China.
""We've removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,"" said Apple spokeswoman Christine Monaghan.
""We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps,"" said Christine Monaghan.
On its official WeChat blog, Tencent said the security issue affected an older version of its app - WeChat 6.2.5 - and that newer versions were not affected.
It added that an initial investigation showed that no data theft or leakage of user information had occurred.
In Apple's walled garden App Store, this sort of thing shouldn't happen.
The company goes to great lengths, and great expense, to sift through each and every submission to the store. Staff check for quality, usability and, above all else, security.
The Apple App Store is generally considered a safe haven as the barrier to entry is high - there's only been a handful of instances of malware found on iOS apps, compared to Google's Play store which for a while was regarded as something of a ""Wild West"" for apps (until they introduced their own malware-scanning system too).
It makes this attack all the more surprising, as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out.
Firstly developers, who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit software to build their apps, creating the right conditions for the malware to be applied.
And secondly, Apple's quality testers, who generally do a very good job in keeping out nasties, but in this case couldn't detect the threat.

The malware was initially flagged by researchers at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba.
It discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of Xcode - a tool used to build iOS apps - to a Chinese cloud storage service.
Then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers.
""In China - and in other places around the world - sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from Apple's servers,"" explained Palo Alto Networks in a follow-up blog.
""As the standard Xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes, some Chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources.""
It added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected.
Apple does have a security tool - called Gatekeeper - that is designed to alert users to unauthorised Mac programs and stop them from being run. However, it appears the developers must disabled the facility, allowing them to create iOS apps with XcodeGhost.
Despite the many news headlines about the breach, one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of Apple products.
""It is definitely embarrassing for Apple but the reality is that malware is a persistent problem since the days of PCs and the problem will multiply as the number of mobile devices explodes from 1.4 billion units in 2015 to 1.8 billion in 2020,"" Wee Teck Loo, head of consumer electronics at market research firm Euromonitor International, told the BBC.
In fact, consumers are less cautious on mobile devices than on PCs, he added.
""In emerging markets like China or Vietnam, mobile devices are their first connected product and security is taken for granted,"" he said.
""Consumers in emerging markets are also less protective of privacy and security issues.""
Earlier this month, login names and passwords for more than 225,000 Apple accounts were stolen by cyber-thieves in China.
It was uncovered by security firm Palo Alto Networks while investigating suspicious activity on many Apple devices. It found a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iPhones.

388,77,malware,Ads 'biggest mobile malware risk',5 March 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26447423,"Adverts on websites are now the biggest source of malware on mobile phones, according to a study.
Research by security company Blue Coat suggests web adverts have overtaken pornography as the most common way for users to encounter a malware threat.
On one in five occasions when a mobile user comes into contact with malware, it is via an online advert.
Mobile malware is growing, but accounts for just 1% of all malware threats, networking company Cisco says.
Although web adverts have replaced pornography as the most common way for users to encounter malware, attacks from X-rated sites are still the most effective.
Less than 1% of all requested content on a mobile is for pornography, yet it is responsible for 16% of malware attacks.
""While users don't access pornography that frequently, when they do, they are very vulnerable to malware,"" said the report.
In comparison, Blue Coat say, adverts make up 12% of requested content but are responsible for nearly 20% of attacks.
The adverts are often displayed through ""legitimate ad networks"" but contain ""malicious code"" or direct users to ""malicious sites"".
The report states that the threat of malware from web ads has increased almost three times since it last looked at data relating to the trend in 2012.
Cisco's 2014 Annual Security Report noted that although mobile malware was ""not a significant percentage"" of web malware encounters ""it is still worth noting because mobile malware is clearly an emerging area of exploration for malware developers"".
It also found that when mobile malware is intended to compromise a device, it is nearly always targeted at Android devices.
But when mobile malware is not specifically designed to target certain types of devices, then 70% of the attacks were experienced by Android devices and 14% by Apple iPhone users.
Blue Coat recommended that mobile users considered blocking web ads on their devices to prevent them becoming victims of a malware attack.
Ad-blocking apps exist for both Android and Apple devices and browser settings can be adjusted to prevent ad pop-ups.",Yes
389,78,malware,Java plug-in malware alert to be issued by Oracle,22 December 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35159851,"Millions of Java users are to be warned that they could be exposed to malware as a result of a flaw that existed in the software's update tool.
The plug-in is installed on many PCs to let them to run small programs written in the Java programming language.
Its distributor Oracle has agreed to issue an alert on both social media and its own site following an investigation by the US's Federal Trade Commission.
By doing so it has avoided the risk of being fined.
However, the firm has not formally admitted to any wrongdoing.
According to the FTC's complaint, Oracle was aware of security issues in the Java SE (standard edition) plug-in when it bought the technology's creator Sun in 2010.
""The security issues allowed hackers to craft malware that could allow access to consumers' usernames and passwords for financial accounts, and allow hackers to acquire other sensitive information,"" the FTC said.
The regulator alleged that Oracle had promised consumers that installing its updates would ensure their PCs would be ""safe and secure"".
But it said the firm had failed to acknowledge that a risk remained.
This was because Sun's original update process did not delete earlier versions of its software, which hackers could exploit to carry out their attacks.
When Oracle initially tried to address this, its update tool only removed the most recent prior version of Java, leaving earlier editions behind.
It was not until August 2014 that the company finally rectified the problem.
Oracle could not plead ignorance because the FTC had obtained internal documents dated from 2011 that stated ""[the] Java update mechanism is not aggressive enough or simply not working"".
According to the watchdog, Java SE is installed on more than 850 million computers.
Because many of those will still not have installed the latest versions of the plug-in, the warning still serves a purpose and provides a link that can be used to detect and uninstall the code.
Java is still used to power some web browser-based games, calculator, chat tools and other functions.
However, one expert said most users should take this opportunity to trash it.
""Java is one of the top three applications that criminals target,"" commented Rik Ferguson, vice president of security research at anti-malware firm Trend Micro.
""It comes pre-installed on a lot of machines, so a lot of people don't know they are using it.
""There are times in some businesses where they may be internal applications that require Java in the web browser, so you won't have much option, but our recommendation for others is to remove it and stop using it.""
Mr Ferguson added that the ruling sent out a message to other software providers that the FTC was concerned about update procedures and might not settle future cases without imposing a financial penalty.",Yes
390,79,malware,Boleto malware may lose Brazil $3.75bn,3 July 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28145401,"Researchers from an American security company have unearthed a substantial malware-based fraud ring.
The operation has infiltrated one of Brazil's most popular payment methods, Boleto, for two years.
An estimated 495,753 Boleto transactions have been compromised, which means the hackers could have stolen up to $3.75bn (Â£2.18bn).
Researchers say it is not known whether the fraudsters were successful in collecting on all of the transactions.
Boleto Bancario allows an individual to pay an exact amount to a merchant and can be used for almost every kind of transaction, from the weekly shop to phone bills.
Boletos can be used and generated both online for electric transfers and offline with printed paper.
The attack has been described by US-based security company RSA, a division of data storage corporation EMC, as ""a major fraud operation and a serious cybercrime threat to banks, merchants and banking customers in Brazil"".
It is not clear how much has been stolen or whether all the funds were successfully redirected to fraudster-controlled bank accounts.
However, this will have been the largest electronic theft in history if even half of the valued worth turns out to be in the hands of criminals, according to the New York Times.
The number of infected PCs totals 192,227 - an additional 83,506 email user credentials have also been stolen.
Known colloquially as a man-in-the-browser threat, the malware silently injects itself into users' web browsers after hackers have initially tricked individuals into clicking malicious links in seemingly ordinary looking emails. This is similar in principle to phishing scams.
Once the malware is in the browser, fraudsters can begin to intercept and alter Boleto details. This activity is invisible to the user.
""Because of its stealth capabilities, end-users also have little chance of detecting Boleto fraud on their own,"" said RSA researchers.
Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer are all vulnerable to the attack.
""Brazil has long been a hotbed of cybercrime, and although we don't know exactly what financial impact may have been caused by this sophisticated attack it's possible that different factors might have helped the hackers get away with it,"" said computer security analyst Graham Cluley.
""Sadly Brazilian computers aren't always necessarily running the very latest anti-virus software, and because Boletos aren't used outside of Brazil it might have made security companies less vigilant about the threat.""
Boletos are the second most popular payment method in Brazil, responsible for an estimated 18% of all purchases during 2012.
""Such attacks will have a serious impact on the confidence we place in increasingly common digital payment methods,"" warned Dr Andrew Rogoyski, chair of techUK cyber-security group.
Mr Cluley advises users to ""be cautious about opening unsolicited email attachments or clicking on unknown links, and keep your computer updated with security patches and the latest anti-virus"".",Yes
391,80,malware,Chinese authorities arrest three over iOS malware,18 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30096049,"Three people have been arrested in China on suspicion of spreading malware that targeted Apple's operating system, Chinese officials have announced.
The Beijing Bureau of public security announced the arrest of suspects charged with spreading the WireLurker malware.
The bug was one of the first pieces of malware to penetrate iPhone's strict software controls.
It mainly infected devices in China.
The suspects - named only as Chen, Lee and Wang - were arrested in the Beijing area,  according to the statement posted on Chinese social network Sina Weibo.
The Chinese authorities also shut down the site that had been spreading the malware.
The malware was installed via software downloaded to Mac desktops from the Maiyadi app store.
It was then able to attack iOS devices connected to an infected Mac via a USB cable.
If a handset was jailbroken - a process used by some to remove Apple's restrictions - WireLurker backed up the device's apps to the Mac, where it repackaged them with malware, and then installed the infected versions back on to the iOS machine.
But, according to security experts, the malware was also able to infect non-jailbroken iOS devices.
It did so by taking advantage of a technique created by Apple to allow businesses to install special software on their staff's handsets and tablets.
This process has since been changed by Apple.
By the time WireLurker had been discovered, infected Mac apps had already been downloaded more than 300,000 times.
Apple took steps to block the infected apps and reminded users not to install software from third-party app stores.
A Windows version of the malware was also found.",Yes

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) confirmed the arrest after it was reported that raids took place in five European countries and the US.
DroidJack allows criminals to spy on smartphone data traffic, eavesdrop on conversations and hijack the camera.
No further arrests have yet been reported.
""I can confirm that the NCA arrested a 28-year-old male from Carlisle under suspicion of computer misuse act offences,"" an NCA spokesman told the BBC.
The spokesman said the arrest was made in connection with the international DroidJack operation and added that the suspect has been bailed for six months.
Officers in the UK, Germany, France, Belgium and Switzerland raided several properties connected to suspected users of malware known as DroidJack.
The searches were reported by the AFP and Reuters news agencies while Europol also say that raids were conducted in the United States.
A total of 13 homes were raided in Germany according to the local prosecutor's office, while news agencies also reported a single raid in Switzerland.
The German suspects were aged between 19 and 51.
DroidJack is a remote access trojan or ""Rat"", which is openly sold online for $210 (Â£137), and affects Android devices only.
""It can track a user's every move without their knowledge,"" explained Peter Coogan, principal security response manager at Symantec.
""There was a documented case back in 2014, I think, where it was being sent out via spam email and pretending to be a bank. It is likely at that time that they were trying to steal banking details off the phone,"" he told the BBC.
Mr Coogan added that he has tracked discussion of the malware on underground hacking forums where DroidJack has been marketed.

393,82,malware,BlackShades: Arrests in computer malware probe,19 May 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27471218,"Seventeen men have been arrested in the UK as part of a worldwide crackdown on a malicious computer program.
The FBI-co-ordinated operation targeted BlackShades software which can remotely control computers and webcams. The ""malware"" was said to have infected more than 500,000 computers since 2010.
The UK's National Crime Agency said 15 arrests took place in England and two men were held in Scotland.
Eighty others were held in 15 countries including the US, France and Germany.
The NCA said the inquiry focused on the developers and ""prolific users"" of BlackShades.
It said investigators believe about 200,000 usernames and passwords of victims across the world may have been taken by UK users of BlackShades.
The software typically infects computers when people click on external links on social networking sites and in emails that purport to lead to pictures, videos or other items of interest, said the NCA.
Once installed, criminals can use the software to capture personal information, or take photographs of computer users - which may be used to blackmail them.
BlackShades also allows users to take control of a computer secretly and encrypt its data, which is only released on payment of a ransom.
The worldwide operation is reported to have come after the FBI arrested two BlackShades developers and obtained a list of the malware's customers.
The software was advertised on forums for computer hackers and copies were available for sale for about $40 (Â£23) each on a website maintained by Blackshades, US officials said.
The FBI said BlackShades has been bought by several thousand people since it was created in 2010, generating sales of more than $350,000 (Â£208,000).
US officials said more than 500,000 computers in more than 100 countries had been infected by BlackShades.  Security experts have also linked the program to attacks on Syrian dissidents in 2012 and attempts to steal data from more than a dozen French organisations.
Details of the raids were outlined at a press conference by Preet Bharara, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who announced charges against five men.
He described BlackShades as a ""frightening form of cybercrime"" saying the program's capabilities were ""sophisticated and its invasiveness breathtaking"".
Blackshades ""enabled anyone anywhere in the world to instantly become a dangerous cyber-criminal able to steal your property and invade your privacy,"" he said.
The malware could also be used to bring down websites and send out ""ransom notes"" to extort cash after telling a user they had lost control of their  computer, he added.
The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead on e-crime, Deputy Chief Constable Peter Goodman, said the operation ""sends out a clear message to cyber criminals that we have the technology, capability and expertise to track them down"".
The NCA said its officers were also to warn people who had downloaded the malware but not deployed it that they were now known to the agency.
In total more than 300 properties were searched across the world and 1,000 data storage devices seized.
The arrests in the UK took place in Derbyshire; Birmingham; Halesowen; Wolverhampton; Newcastle-under-Lyme; Brixham, Devon; Andover, Hampshire; Ashford, Kent; Liverpool; Manchester; Warrington; London; St Andrews; Glasgow, and Leeds.

394,83,malware,Why Iranâs nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack,19 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-55271429,"The end of the Trump era has caused a collective but cautious sigh of relief in Iran.
Some in the Gulf region feared that in the dying days of his presidency Donald Trump might choose to double down on his policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Iran and launch a military strike on its civilian nuclear plants and other targets.
Reports from Washington in November indicated this was one option the US president had looked at, before being talked out of it by his advisers.
By contrast, President-elect Joe Biden has made it clear that he wants the US to rejoin the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran, which would mean reversing sanctions and releasing money to Tehran in exchange for Iran's full compliance.
So is Iran now safe from attack?
In a word, no. Israel remains extremely concerned, not just by Iran's civilian nuclear activities but by its prolific programme to develop its arsenal of ballistic missiles.
On Thursday, Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz was quoted as saying, in reference to Iran's nuclear development programme: ""It is clear that Israel needs to have a military option on the table. It requires resources and investment and I am working to make that happen.""
Israel, as the Islamic Republic's declared enemy, sees a nuclear bomb in Iranian hands as a threat to its very existence and has urged the world to stop it before it is too late.
Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, but its recent action to increase the enrichment of its uranium - one of a sequence which contravene the 2015 deal - has set alarm bells ringing.
In 1981, Israel suspected that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was looking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.
In Operation Babylon, it took pre-emptive action by carrying out a successful air raid using its own F15 and F16 jets, destroying Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor.
Twenty-six years later, in 2007, it did the same to Syria in Operation Outside the Box, destroying a secret plutonium reactor in the desert near Deir al-Zour just before it was activated.
But Iran is a far harder target, in terms of distance, accessibility and air defences.
It is questionable whether Israel could carry out a successful air raid without US participation - something a Biden administration will be reluctant to do.
Conscious of the longstanding threat to its nuclear facilities - from the US, Israel and possibly the Gulf Arab states - Iran has invested money and effort in burying some of them deep underground, beneath its mountains.
Iran's nuclear industry, while ostensibly civilian, is closely entwined with its military and security infrastructure.
In fact, the Iranians have had so long to prepare for an attack that there is now a distinct possibility that their underground facilities are becoming impenetrable.
Despite this, Iran's nuclear facilities remain vulnerable to attack on three fronts.
""Iran's facilities are not impregnable,"" says Mark Fitzpatrick, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and an expert on arms control.
""[The one at] Natanz is vulnerable to precise bunker-busting bombing, maybe taking two precise hits: one to dig a crater and the other to burst through it or at least to shake the delicate machines enough to put them out of commission.""
But Iran is a vast country and its nuclear facilities are spread out in depth.
As far back as 2012 experts suggested that the uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, buried at least 80m (260ft) inside a mountain, might be impregnable to even the devastating explosive power of US ""bunker-busting"" precision-guided bombs.
""Fordo's greater depth protects the facility against bunker-busters, but not against sabotage,"" says Mark Fitzpatrick, ""and it could be put out of commission for a period of months by blasting its entryways and airshafts"".
But to reach these facilities would require one, possibly two waves of air strikes penetrating deep into Iranian airspace and either evading or overpowering its air defences.
Iran has invested heavily in developing its surface-to-air missile force, including the Bavar-373 - a homegrown version of Russia's S-300 system that is capable of tracking and shooting down aircraft up to 300km (186 miles) away.
The prospect of an only partially successful strike, with downed pilots captured and paraded on Iranian TV, is a strong disincentive.
This has already been happening.
Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has managed to develop an extraordinarily well-informed network of agents inside Iran.
So well-informed that when Iran's top military scientist, Brig Gen Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was travelling in a protected convoy on a lonely road east of Tehran on 27 November his attackers knew his precise route and timings.
Reports differ on how he was attacked on that day.
Iran claims it was by a remote, satellite-controlled machine gun mounted on a pick-up truck. Other sources believe it was by a sizable team of Mossad-trained agents, who escaped and remain at large.
Either way, Fakhrizadeh - known as ""the godfather of Iran's nuclear programme"", who US intelligence says carried out covert work on nuclear weapons - was assassinated.
Israel has not commented officially on who was behind it.
Before that, between 2010 and 2012, four leading Iranian nuclear scientists were all assassinated inside Iran, some by car bombs.
Again, Israel neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. But the killings show that despite heavy protection by Iranian state security, assassins are able to reach their targets, setting back Iran's intellectual capacity in nuclear technology.
There is an undeclared war going on in cyberspace, with Iran on one side and the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia ranged against it.
In 2010, a sophisticated piece of malware codenamed Stuxnet was secretly introduced into the computers controlling Iran's uranium-enriching centrifuges at Natanz.
The result was chaos, causing the centrifuges to spin out of control and setting the enrichment programme back by years.
The cyber attack was widely reported to have been Israeli, although US and Israeli experts are believed to have collaborated on developing Stuxnet.
Iran soon hit back, successfully inserting its own sophisticated malware codenamed Shamoon into the network of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, disabling 30,000 computers and threatening Saudi Arabia's oil production.
Further attacks have followed.
The 2015 nuclear deal - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - was supposed to place such stringent curbs on Iran's nuclear activities that it would negate the need for its adversaries to consider a military strike.
But Israel and Saudi Arabia were always sceptical about the deal because they considered it too lenient and temporary, and because it did nothing to address Iran's ballistic missile programme.
Today, they are less than enthusiastic about a Biden presidency reviving the deal unless it addresses those concerns.
Nobody in the Gulf region wants to see another conflict. Even the 2019 missile attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, widely blamed on Iran and its allies, went unanswered.
But as long as suspicions remain that Iran is secretly working on developing a nuclear warhead capability, then the risk of a pre-emptive attack on its facilities will always be there.",Yes
395,84,malware,Malware makers 'tailor' Android threats geographically,20 February 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26272936,"Cyber thieves who target Android phones are getting more sophisticated, suggests a report.
Malware makers are tailoring their creations to make the most of conditions in each territory, said the report by mobile security firm Lookout.
In some places such as Russia, Android users were far more likely to encounter malicious code, it said.
The report comes as analysis of apps on Google's Play store shows a steep rise in the number of malicious programs.
""When it comes to mobile malware, everything is now regionalised,"" said Marc Rogers, Lookout's principal security researcher.
Gone were the days when the hi-tech thieves spammed their creations out to everyone, he said. Now malware varied by region as it was adapted to the different conditions in those places.
In Europe, wider use of security software on smartphones and action by industry groups against some types of fraudulent activity had forced a reaction from the malware makers.
""Most of Europe is now a hostile environment for premium-rate malware,"" said Mr Rogers. ""You can do it, but it is very difficult to monetise.""
Instead, he said, Europe was seeing a rise in so-called chargeware that tries to trick people into paying for a service or app. Pornographic apps were the biggest users of this tactic, he said.
Similarly, the US had seen less use of premium-rate scams in favour of apps that steal data, such as login information for online banking systems.
However, Mr Rogers said premium-rate malware was still very prevalent in Russia where many people got their apps from unofficial sites rather than Google's Play store, putting the country ahead of the world in terms of the percentage of Android users who were likely to encounter malicious apps of all sorts, he said.
The ""encounter rate"" for the average Russian Android user was 68%, he said. By contrast, encounter rates in the US and Europe were about 4%.
Lookout's report, based on stats using feedback from its 50 million users, comes as another security company, RiskIQ, said it had seen a huge rise in the number of malicious programs appearing on Google's Play store.
In 2011 about 10,000 of the 400,000 apps on the Play store were malicious in one way or another. In 2013 the total number of apps hit one million and RiskIQ said 42,000 of these could be classed as malicious.
Apps that helped people personalise their phone were the most likely to be malicious, said RiskIQ.",Yes

The Foreign Office said Russia's GRU military intelligence carried out ""cyber reconnaissance"" against officials and organisations involved.
The alleged attacks took place before the Games were postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Officials did not, however, specify the nature or extent of the cyber-attacks in detail.
At the same time, the US Department of Justice announced charges against six Russian GRU officers for alleged cyber-attacks  serving ""the strategic benefit of Russia"".
The group sought to disrupt the 2018 Winter Olympics, the 2017 French presidential election, and Ukraine's power grid, US prosecutors said.
""No country has weaponised its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as Russia,"" assistant attorney general John Demers told a press conference, calling it ""the most disruptive and destructive series of computer attacks ever attributed to a single group"".
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the attacks targeting organisers, sponsors, and logistics providers of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games were ""cynical and reckless"".
""We condemn them in the strongest possible terms,"" he said. ""The UK will continue to work with our allies to call out and counter future malicious cyber-attacks.""
Foreign Office officials also revealed details of the attack on the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
On that occasion, the operation was a ""false flag"" - one designed to look like it came from North Korea or China, they said.
The UK and US have been trying to increase the pressure on Russian hackers for a number of years by publicly exposing their activity, and they will be hoping that news of Moscow targeting an event like the Olympics will draw wider support from other countries.
It is thought that this attempt at disruption, like the 2018 attack on the Winter Olympics, was in response to Russia being excluded from sporting events for doping violations. Two years ago, some attendees were unable to print tickets for the opening ceremony, leaving empty seats, and this is the first time the UK government has formally attributed that attack to Russia.
Western intelligence officials believe there is some disruption caused by the exposure of Moscow's practices and specific techniques, forcing the hackers to adapt.
But there is not much sign that the public campaign is forcing a rethink over their willingness to engage in such activity.
The 2018 Winter Olympics operation is said to have taken aim at the opening ceremony - targeting broadcasters, officials, sponsors, and even a ski resort.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, which helped to analyse the information, said the 2018 attack was ""intended to sabotage the running of the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games"" by disabling its networks.
One method was to deploy malware that deleted data from the computer systems used that year.
It was prevented by IT officials cutting off affected computers and replacing them entirely to prevent the malware from spreading, it said.
UK officials have attributed several cyber-attacks against major organisations to GRU units operating under various names such as Sandworm, VoodooBear and Iron Viking.
The Foreign Office itself was subjected to one such attack in 2018, when GRU-affiliated hackers attempted to access its computer systems using a spearphishing attack.",Yes

Malicious code sought to exploit vulnerabilities in users' systems and install malware, researchers found.
If installed, that malware could give hackers control of users' computers, said one security consultant.
A spokesman for the Jamie Oliver Group played down the seriousness of the problem and told the BBC that it had been fixed.
According to Malwarebytes, unknown hackers either broke into Mr Oliver's site and placed malicious code there, or exploited existing code.
The script would direct unsuspecting users to a Wordpress site that hosted yet more malicious code. That would then run an exploit kit that would seek to find vulnerabilities in any user's system and install malware called Dorkbot.
Online security consultant Graham Cluley said the hackers could then gain control of a user's system and direct fake searches.
""In other words, you may think you're googling but, in fact, you are being redirected against your will to search results that earn the attackers affiliate cash,"" he told the BBC.
""In addition, you may find that you are tricked into installing bogus security updates on your computer or told to ring what is claimed to be technical support - although you would actually be speaking to scammers after your credit card details.""
According to a spokesman for Jamie Oliver, only 10 users had written to the site about the issue in the past couple of days.
He said that a ""low-level malware problem"" was identified and dealt with and that the site was now ""safe to use"".
The spokesman added: ""The Jamie Oliver website is regularly checked for vulnerabilities by both our in-house team and an independent third party, and they quickly deal with anything that is found.
""The team is confident that no data has been compromised in this incident, but if anyone is worried do please use the contact form on the site.
""We apologise to anyone who was at all worried after going on the site.""
The spokesman confirmed that existing code on the site was modified by a hacker, but said the website team was still trying to work out when that had happened.
The celebrity chef's site has 10 million visitors per month and is ranked 515th in Britain, according to an analyst.
Mr Cluley said that its sheer popularity made the problem ""serious"".
He said: ""Users would hope that there was tight security in place on the website to prevent this kind of attack from happening - but it appears that things went badly wrong on this occasion.""
Jerome Segura, of Malwarebytes, uncovered the issue. He said that, during tests, the malware sought to exploit Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight and Oracle Java.
Mr Cluley advised users to run up-to-date antivirus software and the latest patches to secure applications.
He added that users should avoid running their computers with admin privileges, ""as this is more attractive for attackers"".",Yes

NRC said 20,000 networks had been hit in 2008, with the program recently expanded to include others in Rome, Berlin, Pristina, Kinshasa, Rangoon.
The NSA declined to comment.
The malware could be put in a ""sleeper"" mode and activated with a click of a button, the paper said.
""Clearly, conventional criminal gangs aren't the only people interested in breaking into computer networks anymore,"" wrote computer security expert Graham Cluley in a blogpost.
""All organisations need to ask themselves the question of whether they could be at risk.""
The reports come as Twitter introduces technology it says will help protect people's messages from unwanted scrutiny.

399,88,malware,"Encrochat: Secret network messages can be used in court, judges rule",5 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55953247,"An attempt to stop prosecutors using messages from hundreds of phones that were part of the Encrochat secret communications network in court has been rejected by the Appeal Court.
Judges ruled the messages, obtained by French police by hacking the phones, were not gained by ""interception"".
Under British law, evidence from interception cannot be used in court.
The National Crime Agency believes Encrochat was mainly used by criminals, often to trade drugs and guns.
The judgement will have major implications for cases against suspected organised criminals around the country.
Due to legal restrictions, it is the first time the BBC can report the detail of arguments surrounding Encrochat, which was penetrated by police last summer resulting in more than 1,000 arrests.
The NCA, which obtained the evidence from France, said it was the biggest breakthrough ever in the fight against organised crime.
Senior officers described it ""as akin to cracking the enigma code"".
The messages, sent by suspects who did not know they were being monitored, detail alleged drug dealing and murder plots, and include images and videos.
Many of the cases based on ""Encro"" evidence are now going to court, and if this judgement had ruled the messages couldn't be used, some trials may have been abandoned.
Under long-standing British law, designed to protect intelligence techniques from scrutiny and make criminal trials manageable, intercepted evidence can't be used in court.
In 2016, Parliament passed the Investigatory Powers Act in a massive overhaul of surveillance law. The act introduced a ""double lock"" that requires interception warrants to be authorised by a secretary of state and approved by a judge.
In a 2015 factsheet on the bill before it became law, the Home Office defined interception as ""making available the content of a communication to someone other than the sender or intended recipient during the course of its transmission. In practice that means listening to a phone call or reading an email"".
But the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, Lord Justice Edis, and Mrs Justice Whipple dismissed an appeal by lawyers for Encrochat defendants.
The key legal argument centred on a piece of ""malware"" placed by French experts on Encrochat phones worldwide. It sent copies of every message to a police server.
France has refused to say how, what it called ""the implant"", worked, creating legal uncertainty in British courts.
Encrochat was a private messaging service that promised its users secure and secretive communications.
As well as the Encrochat messaging app, the company developed a modified version of the Android operating system and sold altered smartphones known as ""carbon units"" to run its software.
Switched on by pressing just the power button, the phones would load a ""dummy"" Android homescreen.
But activated another way they would boot into Encrochat mode.
Getting hold of an Encrochat phone was not cheap, and the subscription charges were more than Â£200 a month.
Messages sent between handsets were end-to-end encrypted: scrambled as they travelled across the internet, making them practically impossible to decode if intercepted.
But in June 2020, the company warned its users that an attack had comprised its handsets and advised them to ""physically dispose of your device immediately"".
If the implant had collected the messages as they were being transmitted, this would amount to interception of the communications.
The defence lawyers claimed the implant was taking messages from the phones' memory, milliseconds before being sent to their wifi or mobile data transmitters and therefore the data was ""in transmission"".
But the judges decided the data was in fact being stored temporarily on the devices as it was processed, before being transmitted.
They said this was evident because during the actual transmission the message were encrypted, and therefore couldn't have been read, as they were by the police.
The data collected also included crucial username information from the phone's storage memory, which is not sent as part of the transmission.
In Friday's judgement they compared the process with that of sending a letter: ""The process involves the letter being written, put in an envelope, a stamp being attached and then the letter being placed in the post box.
""Only the last act involves the letter being transmitted by a system, but all the acts are essential to that transmission.""
Families of those arrested during the fall-out from the Encrochat penetration have been arguing online that the NCA broke the law by accessing and reading messages ""in real time"", as they were being sent.
They say British law enforcement agencies effectively allowed a foreign power, France, to hack the phones of 9,000 UK Encrochat users.
Police claimed that in general, using an Encrochat phone, which cost thousands of pounds to own and operate, demonstrated a likely involvement in criminal activity.
But suspects' supporters say innocent family members were caught up in a race to make use of the Encro messages, because police feared they would be criticised if they were not seen to take action.
However the decision of the Appeal Court was that the evidence was collected lawfully.",Yes
400,89,malware,Jamie Oliver website hit by malware for a third time,12 May 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32704043,"The website of British TV chef, Jamie Oliver has been hit for a third time by malware that potentially infects the computers of visitors to the site.
It is the third attack on JamieOliver.com in four months.
The security company that found the exploit, Malwarebytes says the attack, which redirects users to malicious software, is similar to the previous two.
A spokesperson for Jamie Oliver said they were working ""to find the issue"".
Malwarebytes says the problem was caused by a link on the site redirecting users to what appears to be a compromised website that contains links to download the malicious code.
Victims without adequate security against such attacks could then find their PCs are compromised with a program running in the background which scans for and steals passwords, sending them on in a report to criminals behind the scam without the users' knowledge.
""The team in charge of Jamie Oliver's website has acknowledged the issue and is taking steps to remediate this problem once and for all,"" the security company told the BBC.
""Obviously no-one in charge of a website likes to see malware come back time and time again. Website malware is a different beast to Windows-based malware.
""The problem is that often people will get rid of the obvious signs (the symptoms)...  but not what caused it in the first place.""
""We've implemented daily.. malware detection scans, also an industry leading web application firewall to protect against all common security attacks.. which has been blocking numerous hacking attempts,"" said a spokesperson for the website.
""We're working with a number of security companies to find the issue once and for all.  We're also running daily manual checks which have detected and cleaned a number of threats although it's important to note that we have had no reports from any users that have been put at risk.""
Malwarebytes said the best way web users could protect themselves from becoming a victim of such attacks was to keep their security software up-to-date.",Yes
401,90,malware,Blackhole malware exploit kit suspect arrested,9 October 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24456988,"Russian police have reportedly arrested a man on suspicion of masterminding two infamous hacking tools.
He is suspected of being the man behind the alias Paunch - the nickname used by the creator of the Blackhole and Cool exploit kits, sold to cybercriminals to infect web users with malware.
The Russian authorities have not confirmed the details.
But security firms said they had already detected a decline in the programs' use.
A spokesman for the law enforcement agency Europol told the BBC: ""Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre has been informed that a high-level suspected cyber criminal has been arrested.
""We can only refer you to the Russian authorities, they are the ones who should speak about this topic.""
The Russian police's press office said it had nothing to add at this time.
However, Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at the Moscow-based internet protection provider Kaspersky Lab, said the arrest had been confirmed to him by ""anonymous sources"".
The Blackhole kit, released in 2010, dominated the crimeware market throughout 2012 and the start of 2013, according to Fraser Howard, a researcher at the anti-virus company Sophos.
He said the code had been sold for an annual licence of $1,500 (Â£940) or could be rented from its creator for $200 (Â£125) for one week's use, among other price plans.
The software targeted a range of vulnerabilities in the Java programming language, Adobe's Flash media player, Windows software and PDF files.
It had two ways of doing this:
Among the malware downloaded was:
Although Mr Howard said Blackhole was once the biggest threat of its kind, he added that in recent months it had been overshadowed by rival kits, including Sweet Orange and Neutrino.
According to the researcher, the Blackhole and Cool kits put together were only involved in about 4% of all malware detected by Sophos in August, down from 28% the previous year.
The figure had since dropped to 2% in recent days, he added.
Another independent security blogger stressed that the arrest was still significant.
""If it's true that the brains behind the Blackhole has been apprehended it's a very big deal - a real coup for the cybercrime-fighting authorities, and hopefully cause disruption to the development of one of the most notorious exploit kits the web has ever seen,"" said Graham Cluley.
""However, it's worth remembering that nature abhors a vacuum, and there would surely be other online criminals waiting to take their place, promoting their alternative exploit kits and malicious code.""
Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, agreed.
""If indeed it is Paunch that they arrested, that is a major arrest - he is a big deal,"" he told the BBC.
""He was clearly the biggest player in providing exploit kits - not just by selling them, but also renting and leasing them to online criminals.
""Both Blackhole and its successor Cool have been very popular.
""Users didn't have to be very technical to operate them - there was a manual that came with them - they just had to get them running and be able to break into a high-profile website, or create a new one from scratch, to install something bad on your computer.""",Yes
402,91,malware,FBI warns firms of destructive malware use by hackers,2 December 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30287679,"The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned that cyber-hackers have used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US.
A five-page confidential warning was issued to US businesses on Monday, according to Reuters news agency.
The software would make it impossible to recover any lost data, the FBI said.
The warning follows a confirmation from the FBI that it is investigating last week's hack into Sony Pictures Entertainment's network.
Sony Pictures was forced to shut down its corporate network in the attack and some of its unreleased films have also been leaked online.
But the warning from the US authorities did not name any victims that have been targeted.
Instead, it provided some technical details about the malicious software and advice on how to handle such an attack.
There have been accusations that North Korea may have been responsible for the attack on Sony Pictures after the country's government described a film due to be released by the studio on Christmas Day as an ""undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war"".
The Interview, starring Seth Rogan and James Franco, tells the story of a CIA plot to assassinate the North Korean leader.
Pyongyang has written letters to the UN Secretary General and President Barack Obama asking for the film to be blocked, but when asked if it was involved in the cyber-attack on Sony, a spokesman only said ""wait and see"".
Sony has not accused North Korea of involvement and said it was investigating the source of the hacking.",Yes

Yahoo confirmed that for a four-day period in January, malware was served in ads on its homepage.
Experts estimate that as many as two million European users could have been hit.
Security firm Light Cyber said the malware was intended to create a huge network of Bitcoin mining machines.
""The malware writers put a lot of effort into making it as efficient as possible to utilise the computing power in the best way,"" Light Cyber's founder Giora Engel told the BBC.
Bitcoin mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to accumulate the virtual currency with little effort on their part.
""Generating bitcoins is basically guessing numbers,"" said Amichai Shulman, chief technology office of security firm Imperva.
""The first one to guess the right number gets 25 bitcoins and if you have a large volume of computers guessing in a co-ordinated way then you have a more efficient way of making money,"" he added.
Other than a computer running slower, victims will be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ""bitnet"".
It is a variation on the traditional botnet, networks of malware-infected computers used to churn out spam or bombard websites with requests in order to knock them offline.
Some experts estimate that such networks could be generating as much as $100,000 (Â£60,000) each day.
Since bitcoins have risen in value - at its peak one bitcoin was worth $1,000 - making it a lucrative market for online criminals.
""Bitcoin mining malware is the new frontier as criminal gangs look for new ways to make money,"" said Mr Engel.
Yahoo acknowledged the attack in a statement earlier this week.
""From December 31 to January 3 on our European sites, we served some advertisements that did not meet our editorial guidelines - specifically, they spread malware,"" the statement read.
It went on to say that users in America, Asia and Latin America weren't affected but did not specify how many European users were victims.
Fox IT, the Dutch cybersecurity firm which revealed the malware attack, estimates that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site.
Over the period of the attack that could mean as many as two million machines were infected.
Such attacks may be hard to avoid, said Mr Shulman.
""For an ad platform it is virtually impossible to guarantee 100% malware free ads.""
""There are many independent stakeholders involved in the process of web advertising, so from time to time any ad platform is bound to deliver malware.""",Yes

405,94,malware,Dexter payment card malware strikes South Africa,16 October 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24550505,"South Africa has been hit by one of the biggest cyber-fraud attacks in its history, according to the body that oversees local financial transactions.
The payment card systems of thousands of shops, restaurants and hotels had been compromised, said the Payment Association of South Africa (Pasa).
Losses were thought to be in the ""tens of millions, but not hundreds of millions of rands"", it said.
It added the attackers had used a new variant of the malware known as Dexter.
Ten million rand is worth Â£626,000 or just over $1m.
Dexter gets its name from a string of code found in one of its files, which may refer to the US television show that followed the exploits of a serial killer.
The Dexter code was linked to a series of attacks on point-of-sale systems in the UK, US and dozens of other countries towards the end of last year.
It skims and transmits the cards' magnetic-strip information, allowing clones to be made that can then be used for fraudulent purchases,.
Pasa said it believed the criminals responsible were based in Europe, but added it was not sure from which countries.
""It's probably the worst [attack] of its kind in terms of the losses,"" Walter Volker, Pasa's chief executive, told the BBC.
""We started detecting higher levels of fraud at some of these retailers early in the year - from about late-January, February. We initially thought it was a normal seasonal thing, but as the volumes increased we decided to appoint a forensics investigation company.
""Eventually it was able to find this particular malware in some of the locations. Very soon after we found the cause of the compromise, we were able to clean up those sites with anti-malware software.""
Mr Volker added that while the attack had targeted back-end systems to steal data from the cards' magstrips, it had not stolen Pin codes or CVV payment authentication numbers - meaning the thieves would not have been able to withdraw money from bank cash machines or have used the information to make purchases from internet shops.
""Normal anti-virus software would probably have cleaned up Dexter but it was a particular custom-built variant, which was not detectable with the normal scanning software that everybody's got,"" Mr Volker added.
""It seems like it was a European-based syndicate - we don't exactly where - but Interpol and Europol are making good progress in trying to apprehend these particular perpetrators.""
KFC fast-food restaurants' card systems were among those to have been compromised, according to a statement given by the chain's owner to the Bloomberg news agency.
""We take this extremely seriously,"" Yum Brands said. ""Our first priority is to make sure that the impact on our customers remains minimal.""
Bloomberg added that a locally based burger and pizza chain operator, Famous Brands, had also confirmed some of its payment machines had been exposed.
However, Pasa stressed that it would ultimately be the banks - rather than the public or other businesses - that would face losses as a consequence of the attack.
""In terms of the banks, there's probably not a single issuing bank in the country that has not been affected in some way,"" said Mr Volker.
""The South African card holders - or potentially tourists using their cards at the affected sites - will not be exposed to any losses. It's just the inconvenience of detecting false transactions on their accounts.
""If that has happened they should just contact their issuing bank.""",Yes
406,95,malware,Mask malware takes aim at governments and activists,11 February 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26136412,"Sophisticated malware aimed at governments and finance firms was probably created by a nation state, say security researchers.
Mask was uncovered by Kaspersky Labs and the code is thought to have been targeting victims for seven years.
The software is among the ""most advanced threats"" the company has ever seen, it said in a lengthy analysis.
The web-wide activities of Mask stopped last week soon after Kaspersky revealed its existence.
Kaspersky said Mask had hit targets in 31 countries and infected more than 380 separate organisations and businesses.
It used a variety of techniques to compromise machines and, in some cases, its creators seem to have bought undocumented vulnerabilities in software in order to penetrate some targets.
Different versions of Mask were prepared by its creators so no matter what operating system people used, be it Windows, Apple iOS or Linux, they were vulnerable. Kaspersky said it also suspected that versions of Mask were available that could attack Android or Apple smartphones.
The software gets its name from the regular appearance of the Spanish word for mask (Careto) in its core code. Other hints in the code suggest it originated in a Spanish-speaking nation.
Kaspersky said it suspected Mask was created by a nation state to help it spy but declined to speculate about which country was behind it.
Top of the target list were organisations in Morocco but institutions and companies in Brazil, the UK, France and Spain and many other nations were also caught out.
As well as governments and private equity firms, other victims included embassies, oil and gas companies, activist groups and research labs. Once it managed to infect a system, the virus stole documents, encryption keys, private network credentials and remote access information.
Soon after Kaspersky uncovered Mask it took action with other computer firms to shut 90 of the command-and-control systems keeping it running.
So far, said Symantec security researcher Liam O'Murchu, it was not clear who was behind Mask or what they were after.
""Just looking at the targets, it is not obvious who would want to target them; there is no obvious pattern,"" he told Reuters.
""The code is professionally written, but it's even difficult to say whether is it written by a government or by a private company that sells this type of software.""",Yes
407,96,malware,SolarWinds Sunburst: UK data watchdog issues hack alert,23 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55426212,"The UK's data privacy regulator has told organisations under its watch they should ""immediately check"" if they have been affected by the SolarWinds hack.
The Texas-based company - which provides computer network management tools to a wide variety of clients - recently disclosed one of its leading products had been compromised.
The watchdog reminded those holding data on UK citizens they had 72 hours to report a breach once discovered.
Officials continue to study the impact.
Last week, a security source told the BBC that the investigators believed only a small number of British organisations had been affected and none were in the public sector.
However, since then it has been reported that the accountants Deloitte, chip-makers Intel and Nvidia, and cloud-computing software maker VMWare are all among those who have used the Orion network monitoring tool that was altered to provide the hackers a backdoor.
There are also indications that the US Treasury and departments of homeland security, state, defence and commerce were also targeted via the breach, which has been dubbed ""Sunburst"".
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Bill Barr have both accused Russia of being responsible, as have several cyber-security experts.
However, President Donald Trump has muddied the waters by suggesting China could be behind the attack.
Both the Kremlin and the Chinese government have denied involvement.
SolarWinds published its own guidance to its clients on its website last week, however the whole site now appears to be offline.
SolarWinds has said that it believes ""fewer than 18,000"" of its customers had installed the compromised Orion updates.
Bruce Schneier, a leading cyber-security researcher, has written in the Guardian that ""it's hard to overstate how bad this is"".
It will take years to learn which networks the SVR [Russian espionage agency] has penetrated, and where it still has access.""
But he noted that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was probably running similar offensive operations of its own on the same scale.
Even so, President-elect Joe Biden has promised the US will respond in turn, and mentioned suspicions that Russia was to blame.
""We can't let this go unanswered. That means making clear and publicly who is responsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them in account,"" he said in a speech on Tuesday.
Mr Biden also noted that the Department of Defense had refused to brief him on ""many things"" including the attack.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has also urged organisations to take steps to protect their networks.
""This is a complex, global cyber-incident,"" said its director of operations, Paul Chichester.
""But simply having SolarWinds does not automatically make an organisation vulnerable to real-world impact.""
To further complicate matters, Microsoft has said its own inquiry into the breach has uncovered a further problem.
""In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor,"" it said in a blog published on Friday.
It added that that the malicious code provided the perpetrator the means to install and run their own software on a target's machines.
Microsoft did not speculate as to whom this second attacker might be or how they might have exploited the hack.",Yes

Public information website Public Intelligence published the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation memo to US police and emergency medical personnel.
Nokia's Symbian system, on the Finnish company's basic-feature handsets, had had the second-most malware attacks.
Apple's iOS had had 0.7% of attacks.
Android is the world's most popular mobile operating system, and the memo blamed its high share of attacks on its ""market share and open-source architecture"".
Text trojans - malware that sends SMS messages to premium-rate numbers without the phone owners' knowledge - accounted for half of the Android attacks on old versions of the system.
The memo also cited fake sites that appeared to be like Google's Play marketplace and ""rootkits"" that allowed hackers to track a user's keystrokes and passwords.
It said 44% of Android users were still using older versions of the operating system - specifically 2.3.3 through 2.3.7, dubbed Gingerbread and released in 2011.
These have a ""number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions"", the memo added.
""The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date,"" it said.
Apple has said that more than 93% of the 600 million iPhones and iPads sold run  iOS 6, the latest version of the operating system.
The next version is expected to be released to the public next month.
This is the not the first time the open nature of Google's popular phone software has been questioned.
Security firm Symantec noted last month that a ""master key"" bug - which allows attackers to take control of Android phones - was being exploited in China.

It will use San Francisco-based Lookout's software to scan handsets and tablets for threats.
The feature will be targeted at business users as part of the firm's forthcoming Knox security product, which was announced in February.
Numerous studies have indicated that many hackers have focused their efforts on Google's Android system.
Analysts said the move was designed to reassure companies that Samsung's Android phones were a safe alternative to the Blackberry and Windows Phone platforms which have promoted their enterprise security facilities as key features.
Lookout's chief executive blogged that malware protection had become increasingly important at a time more employees were linking their own devices to office networks.
""One in three companies now allow employees to bring their own devices to work, and whether or not it's allowed, employees are doing so and company data is being accessed outside of the corporate network, potentially putting that data at risk,"" wrote John Hering.
The company said its servers would scan Samsung's mobile devices against known malware that could be introduced via email attachments, webpages or file-sharing services.
Other anti-virus firms have also been quick to play up the threat to Android devices.
Kaspersky recently announced that it had detected 57,000 new examples of malware specifically targeting the operating system since the start of the year.
McAfee has also warned that new types of spyware and code designed to bypass bank ID protection had helped swell the amount of Android malware by 35% in the April-to-June quarter.
The US government has also issued its own alert suggesting 79% of all malware threats to mobile operating systems were directed at Android in 2012.
""Android is the most insecure mobile system of all the mobile ones, and that's been made more difficult because it's so fragmented,"" said Richard Absalom, an analyst at telecoms consultancy Ovum.
""It's not just that that people are still running old versions of the software, but that Samsung and other vendors are forking the OS in different ways.""
Google itself has taken steps to address the problem. Earlier this month it banned apps from its Play store that make changes to a device without the owner's knowledge or consent.
But one expert suggested the firm had still not gone far enough.
""New variants of Android malware are found every day, with most designed to steal money from users by signing them up for expensive premium rate SMS scams,"" independent security analyst Graham Cluley told the BBC.
""Much of the Android malware has disguised itself as fake versions of popular apps like Angry Birds or Instagram, and although its normally encountered in unofficial app stores they have also managed to intrude into Google's official Play store on a worrying number of occasions.""
Samsung began offering its Knox product to selected Galaxy S4 handsets in May and has promised it would be extended to other devices.
The Pentagon is among organisations to have authorised the use of handsets which include the feature.
""This approval enables other government agencies and regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services to adopt Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets,"" the South Korean firm said at the time.
Ovum suggested the latest announcement would help give the company an edge over other Android manufacturers such as Sony, HTC and LG.
""What Samsung is doing here is seeing a gap in the market,"" said Mr Absalom.
""Blackberry's share within enterprise is dropping and Windows Phone isn't picking up as fast as Microsoft might have hoped.
""Samsung is the biggest individual smartphone manufacturer out there and it thinks it can now make a major play in the corporate market.""",Yes

In laboratory tests, the malware altered 70 images and managed to fool three radiologists into believing patients had cancer.
The altered images also managed to trick automated screening systems.
The team from Israel developed the malicious software to show how easy it is to get around security protections for diagnostic equipment.
The program was able to convincingly add fake malignant growths to images of lungs taken by MRI and CT scanning machines.
The researchers, from Ben Gurion University's cyber-security centre, said the malware could also remove actual malignant growths from image files to prevent patients who are targets getting the care they need.
The images targeted were scans of lungs but the malware could be tuned to produce other fake conditions such as brain tumours, blood clots, fractures or spinal problems, according to the Washington Post,  which first reported on the research.
Images and scans were vulnerable, said the researchers, because the files were generally not digitally signed or encrypted. This means any changes would be hard to spot.
The researchers suggested the security flaws could be exploited to sow doubt about the health of government figures, sabotage research, commit insurance fraud or as part of a terrorist attack.
In addition, they said, weaknesses in the way hospitals and health care centres protect their networks could give attackers easy access.
While hospitals were careful about sharing sensitive data beyond their boundaries, they took much less care when handling data internally, said one of the researchers.
""What happens within the hospital system itself, which no regular person should have access to in general, they tend to be pretty lenient about,"" Yisroel Mirsky told the Washington Post.
Better use of encryption and digital signatures could help hospitals avoid problems if cyber-attackers tried to subvert images, he added.
Hospitals and other healthcare organisations have been a popular target for cyber-attackers and many have been hit by malicious ransomware that encrypts files and only returns the data when victims pay up.

414,3,computer virus,Iran and Israel's shadow war takes a dangerous turn,13 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-56724039,"The long-running and undeclared shadow war between two of the Middle East's most implacable foes, Iran and Israel, appears to be heating up.
Iran has blamed Israel for a mysterious explosion at the weekend that knocked out power at its uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.
Israel has not publicly said it was behind what Iran calls ""an act of sabotage"" but US and Israeli media reports are quoting officials as saying it was carried out by Israel's overseas intelligence agency, Mossad. Iran has vowed to take revenge ""at a time of its choosing"".
This is not an isolated incident. It follows a gradually accelerating pattern of hostile, tit-for-tat actions by both countries as they step up their covert war while being careful - so far - to avoid an all-out conflict which would be hugely destructive for both nations. So, what are the risks here and how is this likely to end?
This ""shadow war"" can be broadly divided into three distinct fronts.
Israel does not believe Iran's repeated assertions that its nuclear programme is a purely peaceful civil one. Israel is convinced that Iran is secretly working towards developing a nuclear warhead and the means to deliver it with a ballistic missile.
Speaking on Monday during a visit from US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu said: ""In the Middle East there is no threat that is more serious, more dangerous, more pressing than that posed by the fanatical regime in Iran.""
Also on Monday Israel's Ambassador to London, Tzipi Hotovely, told the BBC: ""Iran has never stopped working to develop nuclear weapons and the missiles capable of delivering them. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.. make it a threat to the entire world.""
With this belief in mind, Israel has long been carrying out a series of covert, unilateral and undeclared actions to try to slow down or cripple Iran's nuclear programme.
These include the insertion of a computer virus codenamed Stuxnet, first discovered in 2010, that incapacitated Iran's centrifuges. Earlier this century a number of key Iranian nuclear scientists died in mysterious circumstances and then in November 2020 there was the high-profile assassination near Tehran of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. He was not only Iran's leading nuclear technical expert but he carried a senior rank in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Israel believed he was the person running the covert ""military"" aspect of Iran's nuclear programme.
That programme is now at a potentially dangerous stage.
In 2015 Iran signed up to a multinational nuclear pact called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) which lifted sanctions in exchange for stringent nuclear inspections. But in 2018 President Donald Trump pulled the US out of it, slapping draconian sanctions on Iran, which has responded by incrementally breaking the terms of the deal, most notably enriching uranium - the chemical element that can be used for nuclear energy or, potentially, weapons - beyond the permitted limits.
President Joe Biden wants to bring the US back into the deal but only if Iran returns to full compliance. Iran is basically saying: ""No, we don't trust you, you go first. We will comply fully once sanctions are lifted.""
To try to break this deadlock, negotiators from several countries are meeting in Vienna. But Israel doesn't believe the nuclear deal is worth reviving in its current form. Dr Michael Stephens, a Middle East analyst with the London thinktank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), says recent Israeli actions are a deliberate attempt to sabotage the nuclear negotiations.
""The Israelis are unilaterally trying to derail the Iranian nuclear programme, in a way which, while impressive in terms of technical capacity, is a risky game. First, these Israeli efforts could undermine the US negotiating position as it seeks to re-enter the nuclear deal with Iran.
""But secondly the Iranians may look to counter, through asymmetric attacks against Israeli interests worldwide. Israel has proved it can disrupt the Iranian programme, but at what cost?""
Strange things have been happening at sea recently. Earlier this year an Israeli-owned cargo ship, the MV Helios, was badly damaged while transiting the Gulf of Oman. Two large holes were ripped in its hull and Israel swiftly blamed Iran's IRGC.  Iran denied any involvement.
In April the Saviz, an Iranian vessel anchored in the southern Red Sea, suffered damage to its hull believed to have been caused by limpet mines. Israel and the Saudi-led Coalition in nearby Yemen believe the Saviz has been serving as a logistic ""mothership"" for Iran's Houthi allies in Yemen. Speedboats, machine-guns and sophisticated communication aerials have been spotted onboard but Iran says it is there for peaceful, legitimate purposes and blames Israel for the attack.
US media reports say that over the past 18 months Israeli forces have targeted at least 12 ships bound for Syria, carrying Iranian oil and military supplies.
The fact that Syria has been at war within its own borders for the past 10 years has tended to divert attention away from Israeli military actions there. The civil war opened the way for a huge influx of Iranian military ""advisers"" from the IRGC, working in concert with Iran's Lebanese allies, Hezbollah, to support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In some cases these IRGC forces have ventured within a short distance of the boundary with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Israel has been particularly alarmed at Iran's supply of precision-guided rockets and missiles to its proxies within striking distance of Israeli cities and it has carried out numerous air strikes against these missile bases and supply lines in Syria, with little perceptible response from Iran so far.
The underlying theme of this shadow war is brinkmanship. Neither side can afford to look weak but both Iran and Israel know they need to carefully calibrate their actions so as not to trigger an all-out war. On the nuclear side it is clear that Israeli intelligence has been able to penetrate Iranian security to an astounding degree, deploying both human agents on the ground and cyber weapons to overcome Iranian countermeasures.
On the maritime shipping side, Israel is at something of a geographical disadvantage. It has good access to the Red Sea through its own naval port at Eilat but further afield Iran has the upper hand, thanks to its long Gulf coastline and Houthi proxies in Yemen.
In Syria and Lebanon there is always the option for Iran to deploy its proxies to launch missile strikes against Israel but this is extremely risky. Israel has made it clear the magnitude of its response and where it would land: in Iran.
John Raine, an expert on transnational terrorism with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) says Israel's superior intelligence capabilities mean Iran has to content itself with ""blunt"" responses through its proxies.
""Frustratingly for Iran, its best partner for striking Israel is Hezbollah but that would be an escalatory move which could embroil Hezbollah  in the war Iran wants to avoid. The Iranians usually have the asymmetric advantage but with Israel they are being outboxed. The Israelis have both a longer reach, faster footwork and when they decide to strike bluntly, as they have been doing in Syria, they hit harder.""",Yes
415,4,computer virus,Iran vows revenge for 'Israeli' attack on Natanz nuclear site,12 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-56715520,"The Iranian foreign minister has said his country will ""take revenge"" for an attack on an underground nuclear site, for which it has blamed Israel.
Iranian officials said the Natanz uranium enrichment plant was the target of ""nuclear terrorism"" on Sunday, after initially reporting a power failure.
New advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium had just been activated there.
Israel has not commented, but public radio cited intelligence sources as saying it was a Mossad cyber operation.
They said it had caused more extensive damage than Iran had reported.
US intelligence officials told the New York Times that a large explosion had completely destroyed the independent internal power system that supplied the centrifuges inside the underground facility. They estimated it could take at least nine months to resume enrichment there.
Iran's Nour News agency, which is affiliated to the Supreme National Security Council, cited an intelligence ministry source as saying the ""main perpetrator"" had been identified and an operation was under way to arrest them.
Israel has recently stepped up its warnings about its arch-foe's nuclear programme amid efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that was abandoned by former US President Donald Trump.
His successor, Joe Biden, has said he wants to return to the landmark accord. But Iran and the five other world powers still party to it - China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK - need to find a way for him to lift US sanctions and for Iran to return to the agreed limits on its nuclear programme.
US and Iranian officials are holding indirect talks in the Austrian capital, Vienna, to try to break the impasse, with European officials acting as intermediaries.
The European Union said it still needed to clarify the facts about the Natanz incident, but that it rejected ""any attempts to undermine or weaken diplomatic efforts on the nuclear agreement"".
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is visiting Israel, said he was aware of the reports about Natanz and that the Biden administration's diplomatic efforts to re-engage with Iran diplomatically would continue.
""The Zionists want to take revenge because of our progress in the way to lift sanctions,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted by state media as saying on Monday.
""They have publicly said that they will not allow this. But we will take our revenge from the Zionists.""
Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and often refers to it as the ""Zionist state"".
Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh later told a news conference in the capital, Tehran, that Israel was ""of course"" behind the attack on Natanz.
""This incident, fortunately, did not cause any damage to human lives or the environment. However, it could have been a catastrophe. This is a crime against humanity and carrying out such actions is in line with the essence of the Zionist regime,"" he said.
Mr Khatibzadeh said only the least efficient ""IR-1"" centrifuges were damaged in the incident, and that they would be replaced with advanced ones.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention the incident at a later joint news conference with the US defence secretary.
But he stated: ""My policy... is clear: I will never allow Iran to obtain the nuclear capability to carry out its genocidal goal of eliminating Israel. And Israel will continue to defend itself against Iran's aggression and terrorism.""
The undeclared ""near war"" between Iran and Israel is heating up.
The latest damage done to Iran's nuclear programme, for which Iran has vowed to take revenge, follows a series of tit-for-tat actions around the Middle East.
There have been mysterious explosions on ships' hulls, blamed variously on both countries, and most significantly last November, there was the assassination in broad daylight near Tehran of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the man suspected of leading Iran's military nuclear programme. The Israeli air force has also carried out numerous air strikes against missile bases in Syria and other sites where Iranian advisers have been providing assistance to units of Hezbollah, the Shia Islamist militant group.
Israel sees Iran's nuclear programme as a potential threat to its existence and is determined to delay or stop it. It does not see any point in current efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal, believing it to be ineffective.
The attack on Natanz is likely to strengthen the hand of Iran's hardliners and complicate any future negotiations.
Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235.
The nuclear deal only allows Iran to use IR-1 centrifuges to produce limited quantities of uranium enriched up to 3.67% concentration, which can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Uranium that is enriched to 90% or more can be used to make nuclear weapons.
Iran, which insists it does not want nuclear weapons, has retaliated against the sanctions reinstated by the Trump administration by rolling back key commitments under the accord.
These have included operating advanced centrifuges, resuming enrichment to 20% concentration, and building a stockpile of that material.
On Saturday, when Iran marked National Nuclear Technology Day, President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated a cascade (or cluster) of 164 advanced IR-6 centrifuges at Natanz. He also launched tests on new IR-9 centrifuges, which officials said could enrich uranium 50 times faster than the IR-1.
This is not the first time that Natanz has been the target of sabotage.
Last July, an above-ground centrifuge assembly plant was badly damaged by what Iranian officials said was a fire. In response, Iran began building a new structure underneath nearby mountains.
Enrichment at the plant was previously disrupted by the Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to have been created by the US and Israel. The virus, which was discovered in 2010, changed the speeds at which the centrifuges spun and reportedly ruined almost 1,000 of them.
Iran also accused Israel of being behind the assassination of its top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, last November. Israel neither confirmed nor denied any involvement.
And in recent months the countries have accused each other of being behind explosions that have damaged Israeli and Iranian commercial vessels.

416,5,computer virus,Computer virus shuts genealogy records service,30 March 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-35928037,"The National Records of Scotland genealogy service has been closed until further notice due to a computer virus.
The public search rooms, at New Register House in Edinburgh, were shut on Wednesday 23 March
It followed the discovery of ""ransomware"" in an admin file.
A spokeswoman said the virus, which can restrict access to files and then demand payment for them to be released, was caught before it could do any damage.
Cyber security is now being checked.
Copies of birth and other certificates are still available and neither the registration service nor the Scotland's People website are affected.
The closure affects public access to photographs of birth records less than 100 years old, marriage records less than 75 years old, and death records less than 50 years old, which can only be viewed in person at the office and not online.
The service is normally used by people looking to research their family tree.
Anne Slater, speaking on behalf of the National Records of Scotland, said: ""The service has been closed since last Wednesday.
""It's a ransomware virus. It comes in and tries to lock up your files and then you have to give them money.
""It was noticed in a file. I believe it was a spreadsheet - an administration file. ""
Ms Slater said that it was thought the virus first got into the file after it was embedded in a website which been clicked on. She said was spotted before it could cause any damage.
She added it was contained the same day and the reason for the current closure was because of rigorous safety checks.
She said: ""It's a belt and braces approach. We're checking all our back-end network. ""
Asked if she knew when the service would re-open, she said: ""Right now, no. We're looking to open it as soon as possible.""
A spokeswoman for Fraser and Fraser, the firm which features in BBC One series Heir Hunters, said one of their researchers was told about the issue when they arrived to do a routine check.
She said: ""For us these records are crucial for our research, so we can confirm that the correct family members and/or beneficiaries are located and receive their entitlement from the unclaimed estates.
""Our concern is how long will they be gone for?""",Yes
417,6,computer virus,Computer virus affects hospitals in Lincolnshire 'for five days',1 November 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-37833853,"Routine operations and outpatient appointments could be suspended for five days because a virus caused the computer network to crash.
Hundreds of people are affected by the attack on Northern Lincolnshire and Goole (NLAG) NHS Foundation Trust and United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust.
About 20 operations have been cancelled at Lincoln County and 15 at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston.
NLAG said contingency plans were in place to maintain emergency services.
More on this story and others on BBC Local Live: Lincolnshire
The antenatal department is running as normal, as are chemotherapy, audiology, paediatrics, gynaecology, community and therapy and laboratory services.
A limited number of endoscopy procedures at NLAG will also go ahead.
NLAG runs hospitals in Goole, Grimsby and Scunthorpe, and its computer system is linked to that at United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust (ULHT).
The trust's deputy chief executive Karen Dunderdale said it was working under major incident status following Sunday's cyber attack.
She said that the named departments were the only ones functioning as normal:  ""Patients who have appointments in all other departments should assume their appointment/procedure is cancelled unless they receive a telephone call to say otherwise.""
A statement on the ULHT website said ""Our A&Es are open, but we urge everyone to think twice before they go to A&E - if it's not serious or life threatening, you shouldn't be there.""
The medical director at NLAG, Laurence Roberts, said it was possible to get access to patient information on the computer system, but it was very slow.
""We can get at that material but it does mean having to access it at very central points in the organisation and then either print it out and walk it around or people have to walk around the building to access it.""",Yes
418,7,computer virus,The computer virus that blackmails you,14 December 2015,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35091714,"Ransomware is the fastest growing form of computer malware, experts warn.
It's a malicious virus that locks the user out of their computer and demands a fee to return their files.
A report published by the Australian government claims 72% of businesses surveyed experienced ransomware incidents in 2015.
The figure was just 17% in 2013 .
It's also a growing threat for mobile devices as it can be hidden in an app, says Gert-Jan Schenk, vice-president at internet security company Lookout.
""For the most part, we've seen ransomware delivered through drive-by downloads - it pretends to be a popular app, increasing the chances that you'll click on it,"" he explains.
""To avoid these threats, users should be very careful about what apps they install, and where they come from - read the reviews on Google Play, and avoid side-loading from untrusted sources.""
Like most computer viruses, ransomware often arrives in the form of a phishing email, or spam, or a fake software update - and the recipient clicks a link or opens an attachment.
The virus then sets to work encrypting the user's files.
Once the computer is effectively locked down, it demands a fee - often in bitcoins because it is less easy to trace - for the return of the files.
The fee is generally one or two bitcoins - the equivalent of about $500 (Â£330).
It is less common now, but in the earlier days of the malware - about five years ago - the ransom note could take the form of a law enforcement notice.
The user was directed to a web page that appeared to be from, for example, the FBI, falsely claiming illegal images of children had been been found on the machine and a fine was payable.
There is generally a time limit to comply, after which the ransom increases.
Sometimes it is just a threat, but mostly the virus really does encrypt files.
The only way to retrieve your files without paying the ransom is to go to a backed-up version.
Neil Douglas, from Edinburgh-based IT company Network Roi, has just helped a small business client whose server was hit by ransomware.
""We had to recover everything from back-up. We'd had a back-up two minutes before the infection, so the timing couldn't have been any better - but it did result in quite a bit of downtime,"" he says.
""You could risk paying them - but it's a bit like paying  a blackmailer. We would only recommend it as a last resort.
""You don't know whether they'll come back for more, you don't know that they'll clear the infection.""
Cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward says paying also leaves you vulnerable to further cybercrime.
""As soon as you pay up, you get on a suckers' list and you'll probably get contacted again,"" he says.
""It's low-hanging fruit for the criminals.""
While all the expert advice is, of course, not to pay, plenty of people do - even those you would least expect to.
Tewksbury Police, in the US, admitted they had paid up when their main server had been attacked and locked down at the end of last year.
""Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,"" Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the town's local paper.
""We did everything we possibly could.
""It was an eye-opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything.
""Paying the bitcoin ransom was the last resort.""
Ransomware is lucrative for criminals because so many victims pay rather than face the shame of false accusations - or like the police department, they just desperately need their files.
""Some companies have set up bitcoin accounts in case it happens to them,"" says Prof Woodward.
""I would recommend that nobody ever pays up.
""The only way to deal with it is to be sure you have a virus checker and back up.""
""It tends to be organised crime,"" says Prof Woodward.
""They do make millions out of it. It's opportunistic... they just try it on everybody. You keep third parties out of it - the bank isn't involved.""
Recent research by Palo Alto Networks and industry partners suggested one family of ransomware known as Crypto Wall had generated about $325m (Â£215m) for the gang behind it.
""In the volume cybercrime space, ransomware is one of the most prolific problems we face,"" Greg Day, chief security officer for Europe at Palo Alto Networks, told the BBC last month.
""Credit card theft is getting to the point where the value of each card is very low.  As a result, ransomware has stepped into that gap and gives a higher value for each victim.""",Yes

420,9,computer virus,Russian hacker group Evil Corp targets US workers at home,26 June 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53195749,"A Russian hacking group is launching ransomware attacks against a number of US companies, targeting employees who are working from home due to Covid-19.
Evil Corp hackers have tried to access at least 31 organisations' networks in order to cripple systems and demand millions of dollars in ransom.
The group's two alleged leaders were indicted by the US Justice Department in December 2019.
There are concerns that US voting systems could also be targeted.
Last year, US authorities filed charges against Evil Corp's alleged leaders Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev, accusing them of using malware to steal millions of dollars from groups including schools and religious organisations in over 40 countries.
Officials announced a $5m reward for information leading to their arrest, which they said was the largest amount ever offered for a cyber criminal. Both men are still at large.
The threat comes as the majority of Americans have been working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic -  62% according to a Gallup poll.
The US presidential election is also just months away, and federal and local officials have been working to put measures in place to protect voter records as well as manage safe voting practices amid the pandemic.
Symantec Corporation, a firm that monitors corporate and government networks released a notice warning of the threat it identified on Thursday night.
The attacks used what Symantec described as a relatively new type of ransomware called WastedLocker, which has been attributed to Evil Corp. Ransomware are computer viruses that threaten to delete files unless the ransom is paid. The WastedLocker ransomware virus demands ransoms of $500,000 to $1m to unlock computer files it seizes.
Symantec said the ""vast majority of targets are major corporations, including many household names"", and eight targets were Fortune 500 companies. All are US-owned but one, which is a US-based subsidiary.
Most targeted companies were in the manufacturing, information technology and media sectors.
Symantec said the hackers had breached the networks of these companies and were ""laying the groundwork"" for future ransomware attacks that would let them block access to data and demand millions of dollars.
Symantec technical director Eric Chien told the New York Times the hackers take advantage of employees now using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access work systems.
They use VPNs to identify which company a user works for, and then infect the user's computer when they visit a public or commercial site. When the user next connects to their employer's system, the hackers can attack.
There have been a number of recent cyber-attacks on local governments across the US.
Cities and towns in Louisiana, Oregon, Maryland, Georgia, Texas and Florida were hit by ransomware attacks last year.
The Department of Homeland Security is looking into safeguarding voter registration databases ahead of November 3's general election. In February, the agency's head of cyber-security said this was a key election security concern.
These attacks by foreign cyber-criminals are far from a new threat.
During the impeachment inquiry last year, former White House security adviser and Russia expert Fiona Hill testified that ""Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election"".
In 2018, the justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections, using spear phishing emails and malicious software.
The hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board site. Moscow has said there is no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking.",Yes
421,10,computer virus,Computer virus hits office printers,22 June 2012,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18547935,"Thousands of office printers around the world have been spewing out page after page of gibberish because of a computer virus.
Reports from companies reveal that thousands of pages of paper were wasted when the Windows virus hit their PCs.
Security firms said the worst hit were large businesses in the US, India, Europe, and South America.
The culprit is a malicious program called Milicenso that has been re-used many times by hi-tech crime groups.
In a blogpost analysing the virus, security firm Symantec
 said Milicenso was first seen in 2010 and because it was a ""malware delivery vehicle for hire"" had turned up regularly ever since.
Its most recent incarnation was as a tool for distributing French language adware. Symantec said Milicenso could infect a PC by various routes, such as an email attachment, via a compromised website or by posing as a fake video decoder.
Once installed, the virus polls a location on the net and re-directs web traffic so it serves up adverts.
Symantec said one side effect of infection was to generate a file in a PC's printer queue. This turns the contents of the files in the virus's main directory into print jobs.
""The garbled printouts appear to be a side effect of the infection vector rather an intentional goal of the author,"" said Symantec.
Victims hit by the virus have reported its effects via discussion forums run by security firms.

422,11,computer virus,South Korea network attack 'a computer virus',20 March 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21855051,"Disruption that paralysed the computer networks of broadcasters and banks in South Korea appears to have been caused by a virus, an official close to the investigation has told the BBC.
The official said it was believed a ""malicious"" code was to blame for the system failure.
He said investigators were trying to identify and analyse the virus.
Last week, North Korea accused the US and its allies of attacks on its internet servers.
In the latest incident, two South Korean banks, Shinhan Bank and Nonghyup, and three TV stations KBS, MBS and YTN, all reported that their networks had suddenly shut down on Wednesday afternoon.
The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says that, for one of the world's most networked populations, South Korea has had more than its share of cyber attacks.
North Korea has been blamed for several breaches over the past few years, she says.
Initially, South Korea's Communications Commission suspected a cyber-attack. However, the BBC was later told that experts had concluded it was not a denial-of-service attack, of the kind South Korea has experienced in the past.
Staff at the three broadcasters said their computers crashed and could not be restarted, with screens simply displaying an error message, although they have continued to make television broadcasts, our correspondent said.
There were also reports of skulls popping up on some computer screens, which could indicate that hackers had installed malicious code in the networks, the Korean Internet Security Agency said.
Some services at Shinhan bank, including internet banking and ATM machines, were also affected, although operations now appear to have been restored.
In the immediate aftermath of the incident, South Korean internet service provider LG Uplus said it believed its network had been hacked, Reuters news agency reported.
An official from the presidential office told Yonhap news agency it was not yet known whether North Korea was involved.
""We do not rule out the possibility of North Korea being involved, but it's premature to say so,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said.
Hackers can cover their tracks by launching their attacks indirectly by hijacking other people's computer systems, says the BBC's technology correspondent Mark Gregory.
Tracing an attack to its original source can be complex in the extreme, he adds.
However, in some highly sophisticated attacks, hackers' precise methods have provided clues to their identity.
Slight variations in method have acted as a kind of digital signature, to help investigators trace who they are, our correspondent says.
No government-related computer networks were affected, an official from the National Computing and Information Agency (NCIA) told Yonhap.
The military has upgraded its information surveillance status by one level, Yonhap said.
North Korea is believed to have been behind two major cyber attacks on the South, in 2009 and 2011, that targeted government agencies and financial firms.
Nonghyup bank was one of the victims of the 2011 attack, which left its customers unable to access or transfer their cash for three days.
North Korea has stepped up rhetoric in recent days in response to fresh UN sanctions over its nuclear test in February and joint annual military drills between the US and South Korea, which it bitterly opposes.
On 15 March, North Korea's KCNA news agency accused the US and its allies of ""intensive and persistent"" hacking attacks on its networks.
Official sites such as KCNA, Air Koryo and Rodong Sinmun, the party newspaper, were reportedly inaccessible for short periods.",Yes

The attacks come as security experts warn of efforts by malicious hackers to target the oil and energy industry.
The attack forced the Qatar-based RasGas firm to shut down its website and email systems.
RasGas, one of the world's largest producers of liquid petroleum gas, said production was not hit by the attack.
The company said it spotted the ""unknown virus"" earlier this week and took desktop computers, email and web servers offline as it cleaned up.
The report comes only days after Saudi Arabia's Aramco revealed it had completed a clean-up operation after a virus knocked out 30,000 of its computers. The cyber- assault on Aramco also only hit desktop computers rather than operational plant and machinery.
Both attacks come in the wake of alerts issued by security firms about a virus called ""Shamoon"" or ""Disstrack"" that specifically targets companies in the oil and energy sectors.
Unlike many other contemporary viruses Shamoon/Disstrack does not attempt to steal data but instead tries to delete it irrecoverably. The virus spreads around internal computer networks by exploiting shared hard drives.
Neither RasGas nor Aramco has released details of which virus penetrated its networks.
The vast majority of computer viruses are designed to help cyber-thieves steal credit card numbers, online bank account credentials and other valuable digital assets such as login names and passwords.
However, an increasing number of viruses are customised to take aim at specific industries, nations or companies.
The best known of these viruses is the Stuxnet worm which was written to disable equipment used in Iran's nuclear enrichment efforts.",Yes
424,13,computer virus,Android mobiles hit by spamming computer virus,18 December 2012,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20768996,"Cyber-thieves are using games including Angry Birds to turn Android phones into spam-sending drones.
Phones have been infected with spam-forwarding software that hid inside free versions of popular Android games.
Once installed, the booby-trapped app contacts a web server for a list of phone numbers then starts sending junk text messages to them.
Angry Birds Space, Need for Speed Most Wanted and many other games have been used in the attack.
The first stage of the campaign to recruit phones to act as spam relays. It involved sending out thousands of messages supposedly offering people free versions of popular Android games, said network security firm Cloudmark in an analysis of the SpamSoldier attack.
The copies of the games were held on a server in China rather than on the main Google Play store, it said. After the app is downloaded users must disable some safeguards, grant the app permission to install and give it the ability to browse the web or send texts messages before it will run.
Once installed the app removes its icon from a phone's main screen and then contacts a central server for a list of target phone numbers. It then starts sending out spam messages in a bid to trick more people into downloading and installing the rogue app. Other spam messages sent via infected phones falsely told people they had won a gift card.
In a separate analysis mobile security firm Lookout said SpamSoldier worked hard to hide its activity by editing outgoing message logs to hide the junk texts being sent. In addition, it also looks for responses from the numbers it spammed to prevent victims finding out about its presence.
So far, said security firms, the number of phones infected remained low but junk texts sent by infected phones were starting to pop up on all US carriers. Cloudmark said whoever was behind the attack had recently ramped up their use of it. Now, it said, it was seeing more than 500,000 junk texts per day being sent through infected Android phones.
""This sort of attack changes the economics of SMS spam, as the spammer no longer has to pay for the messages that are sent,"" said analyst Andrew Conway at Cloudmark. "" Now that we know it can be done, we can expect to see more more complex attacks that are harder to take down.""
Ciaran Bradley, head of handset security at Adaptive Mobile, said growing numbers of spammers were adopting this tactic.
""We've also seen the spammers try to spread the infection by advertising free adult videos featuring a well-known reality TV star,"" he said. "". It illustrates the lengths spammers will go to to ensure their messages are delivered and to avoid detection.""
To help protect themselves, Android owners were urged to be wary of unexpected messages that offer free versions of apps which are usually sold.",Yes
425,14,computer virus,Computer virus accuses victims of viewing child porn,1 February 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21291925,"German federal police are warning about a computer virus that accuses victims of viewing ""juvenile pornography"".
It also displays an image that it claims reveals images of child sexual abuse have been viewed on a computer.
The Windows virus locks a computer and only returns control to its owner on payment of a 100 euro (Â£86) fine.
It purports to be collecting cash on behalf of German copyright authorities and the country's national computer security agency.
The virus amounted to ""digital extortion"" and victims should not pay up, said German police.
The warning about the novel strain of ransomware was issued by Germany's Federal Criminal police office (the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA).
The ransomware version found by the BKA uses a pop-up window that says the machine has been locked down due to ""unauthorised network activity"". The window is crafted to look like it has been put together by Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BKI) and its society for prosecution of copyright infringement (GVU).
Text in the window claims that images of child sexual abuse as well as pirated content have been found on the machine. Also displayed is an picture of a child which it claims reveals illegal images have been viewed.
Rik Ferguson, director of security research at Trend Micro, said it was the first time he had heard of ransomware displaying images that users were accused of harbouring.
""It seems that they are attempting to increase the pressure of this kind of emotional blackmail,"" he told the BBC.
Germany's BKA said users should not pay the fine ""under any circumstances"" and added that neither the BKI or GVU collected cash in this way from those suspected of viewing illegal images or pirating content. Instead, users should use anti-virus and other security software to clean up their PC and deal with the virus.
""This is a form of digital extortion,"" said the BKA in its alert about the virus.
Ransomware, which tries to make victims pay an on-the-spot fine, is becoming more prevalent but most strains simply accuse people of pirating movies or music. Others scramble data that is only unscrambled when a fee is paid.
Security firm Symantec said it was seeing more and more strains of ransomware and said it could be ""highly profitable"" for its creators. It estimated that ransomware makers were already making about $5m (Â£3m) a year from such malicious code.",Yes
426,15,computer virus,Love Bug's creator tracked down to repair shop in Manila,3 May 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52458765,"The man behind the world's first major computer virus outbreak has admitted his guilt, 20 years after his software infected millions of machines worldwide.
Filipino Onel de Guzman, now 44, says he unleashed the Love Bug computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying.
He claims he never intended it to spread globally.
And he says he regrets the damage his code caused.
""I didn't expect it would get to the US and Europe. I was surprised,"" he said in an interview for Crime Dot Com, a forthcoming book on cyber-crime.
The Love Bug pandemic began on 4 May, 2000.
Victims received an email attachment entitled LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU. It contained malicious code that would overwrite files, steal passwords, and automatically send copies of itself to all contacts in the victim's Microsoft Outlook address book.
Within 24 hours, it was causing major problems across the globe, reportedly infecting 45 million machines. It also overwhelmed organisations' email systems, and some IT managers disconnected parts of their infrastructure to prevent infection.
This led to estimates of damage and disruption running into billions of pounds.
In the UK, Parliament shut down its email network for several hours to protect itself, and even the Pentagon was reportedly affected.
The previous year, the Melissa bug is believed to have infected a million machines using similar tactics. However, Love Bug dwarfed previous outbreaks and exposed how vulnerable the world's increasing internet connectivity was to attack.
Investigators traced the virus to an email address registered to an apartment in Manila, capital of the Philippines.
The occupant's brother was Onel de Guzman, a computer science student at the city's AMA Computer College. He was a member of an underground hacking group called Grammersoft and quickly became the lead suspect in a police investigation.
De Guzman's lawyer organised a press conference on 11 May, at which de Guzman appeared to speak little English.
When asked whether he may have released the virus accidentally, de Guzman said: ""It is possible.""
At the time, the Philippines had no law covering computer hacking, and neither de Guzman nor anyone else was ever prosecuted.
Suspicion also fell on de Guzman's fellow student Michael Buen, who has been cited online as the co-author of the Love Bug.
I set out to track down Onel de Guzman and resolve the 20-year mystery of Love Bug's origin.
Online rumours claimed de Guzman had moved to Germany, Austria or the US. Some claimed he had been recruited by Microsoft following the outbreak. All proved to be wide of the mark.
On a forum dedicated to the Philippine underworld, a user claimed in 2016 that de Guzman ran a mobile phone repair shop in the Quiapo district of Manila. In April 2019, I visited the area hoping to encounter the suspect, only to find a sprawling market containing dozens of mobile phone repair shops.
I wrote Onel de Guzman's name on a piece of paper and showed it to shop workers at random in the hope that someone would recognise it. Finally an employee said he knew of de Guzman and believed he now worked in another phone repair booth at a shopping mall elsewhere in Manila.
After several hours wandering around the mall and showing de Guzman's name, I was directed to a cramped, messy stall at the very back of the building, and after waiting several hours for him to turn up, Onel de Guzman arrived.
He admitted having created Love Bug, which he said was a revamped version of an earlier virus he had coded in order to steal internet access passwords.
In the era of dial-up internet, such passwords were needed to get online, and de Guzman says he could not afford to pay for one.
He claims he initially sent the virus only to Philippine victims, with whom he communicated in chat rooms, because he only wanted to steal internet access passwords that worked in his local area.
However, in spring 2000 he tweaked the code, adding an auto-spreading feature that would send copies of the virus to victims' Outlook contacts, using a flaw in Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. He also created a title for the email attachment that would have global appeal, tempting people across the world to open it.
""I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love, so I called it that,"" he said.
De Guzman claims he sent the virus initially to someone in Singapore, and then went out drinking with a friend. The first he knew of the global chaos he had unleashed was when his mother told him police were hunting a hacker in Manila.
He explained that his mother hid his computer equipment. De Guzman insists Buen had nothing to do with Love Bug and that he was its sole creator.
After a period of lying low, de Guzman returned to computer work but did not go back to college. He now runs the small booth with another member of staff.
He says he regrets writing the virus, and the infamy it has brought him.
""Sometimes I get my picture on the internet,"" he said.
""My friends say, 'It's you!' I'm a shy person, I don't want this.""",Yes

They say the Gozi virus was used to access personal bank information and steal millions of dollars in 2005-11.
The suspects - a Russian, a Latvian and a Romanian -  ran a ""modern-day bank robbery ring, that required neither a gun or a mask"", the prosecutors say.
The three men - all in their 20s - have already been arrested.
Nikita Kuzmin, a 25-year-old Russian national, pleaded guilty to the charges in May 2011, US Attorney Preet Bharara revealed at a news conference in New York on Wednesday.
Extradition proceedings against the other two men - Romania's Mihai Ionut Paunescu, 28, and 27-year-old Deniss Calovskis from Latvia - are now under way.
The ongoing US government investigation alleges that the scheme began in Europe and later spread to the US, where at one stage more than 190 computers belonging to America's Nasa space agency were infected.
They say that Mr Kuzmin and his co-defenders - nicknamed Virus and Miami - have managed to produce at least $50m (Â£32m) in illegal profits using the virus.
""This case should serve as a wake-up call to banks and consumers alike because cybercrime remains one of the greatest threats we face, and it is not going away anytime soon,"" Mr Bharara said.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) issued a warning about a booby-trapped file posing as an add-on for net phone service Skype.
Anyone caught out by the malicious file would give its creators remote access to their computer.
The EFF said the attack was the latest in a series aimed at Syrian dissidents.
In its warning
, the EFF said the malicious program was in a message being sent to people known to be supporters of the rebels in Syria.
Posing as an ""important new video"" the program claims to be able to encrypt and protect calls made by Skype.
However, the EFF said anyone installing the program would be putting in place a remote-access Trojan file designed to snoop on a victim's computer. The malicious program can log keystrokes and take screenshots.
In the past, said the EFF, activists have been targeted through YouTube and Facebook and have been subject to a variety of phishing attacks.
Analysis of the latest Trojan led the EFF to conclude that it was the work of the same group that was behind earlier attacks. In particular, it said, data gathered by the malicious program deposits it on a site controlled by the Syrian government.
""For Syrian activists, poor security practices can have potentially disastrous consequences,"" said the EFF.",Yes

The pop-up suggested her three-month-old computer was at risk and directed her to update her security settings by downloading a file.
Moments later, the mother-of-one's phone rang and a man claiming to be from Windows Support told her the laptop had a virus.
""It was really convincing,"" says the 37-year-old research manager from south London.
""They had my details without me giving my name and address. I asked how they knew I was online and he said they could tell when something had been downloaded.
""He told me it was not performing at full speed and that it could crash at any moment. We were on the phone for an hour while he took me through various files in my hard drive.""
Whenever Ms Fawcett began to doubt the caller's authenticity, he would reassure her - at one point asking his supervisor to take over.
""They sounded so professional,"" she said.
She was then directed to another website and it was explained that for a Â£70 annual fee, her computer could be instantly wiped clean of viruses.
""I was totally freaked out. I didn't hand over any money but it was the thought it could happen.""
After Ms Fawcett refused to give her credit card details, the caller finished the conversation by saying she should take time to think about it.
However, afterwards, she tried a web search for the name of the website she had been directed to - and got a string of results identifying the site with a type of ""rogue anti-spyware"".
A friend has since checked her laptop and says initial indications are that nothing is amiss.
However, Ms Fawcett says the experience has left her nervous of using the web, where previously she would have been happy to browse and shop online.
""Even having the laptop back made me anxious. It feels like other people have a window into your home.""
Tony Neate, managing director of internet advice service Get Safe Online, said this was a typical tactic of an organised scam.
""If you download some sort of trojan that can take over your computer, it can find registration documents from software you may have signed up for.
""Once they have a name, address and phone number, they can say they have been monitoring your computer.""

433,22,computer virus,Making the first computer virus,19 November 2009,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8366703.stm,"If you've ever had to spend a lot of money on antivirus software, you'd be forgiven for wanting to take Dr Fred Cohen aside for, to put it politely, a few choice words.
But although Dr Cohen is responsible for creating the first ever computer virus some 26 years ago, his pioneering research has in fact led the way in protecting computers from the threats that surfaced in the years to come.
He told BBC World Service's Witness programme about the day he made the discovery while studying at the University of Southern California.
After a neighbouring university created a Trojan horse - which allowed hackers to gain access to a machine - Dr Cohen realised that the Trojan could be programmed to duplicate itself.
This is the proverbial lightbulb going off.
""I was sitting there in the class and all of a sudden it dawned on me that if that Trojan horse copied itself into other programs, then all those programs would be infected, and then everybody that ran any of those programs would get infected and so forth.
""It was at that point immediately obvious that it was game over.""
He discussed the idea with Dr Len Adleman, another computer security expert at the university.
""Fred approached me and said he had this new type of computer security threat, and he began to describe what we now call viruses,"" recalled Dr Adleman.
""He wanted to run some actual experiments, in particular on the computer that I used.
""There was no point in running an experiment, since it was so obvious that it was going to work.""
However, Dr Cohen insisted they make sure - and the first computer virus was born.
""In that moment, I pretty much understood the bad news.
""I spent the next five or six years of my life trying to find ways to protect against it and understanding the limits of what could ever be done.""
Ethical dilemma
Armed with their new discovery, the pair faced a problem.
It had the potential to have a massive negative impact on the computing world. As academics, did they have an obligation to share their findings or should the vulnerability be kept secret?
They decided to publish the paper.
""If we told people about computer viruses, they could potentially protect themselves,"" said Dr Adleman.
""It was also at least my impression that computer viruses were inevitable, and were going to arrive whether Fred published or not.
""In the end we decided to publish, but to not make the code that Fred put in his paper so explicit that an amateur could take it and produce computer viruses.""
Dr Cohen agreed.
""This was going to happen one way or another. The real question was is it going to happen after somebody's done the research, and figured out what to do about it, or is it going to happen before the research is done - and then we're really in trouble.""
Dr Cohen believes that genuine research into possible threats has not happened for quite some time.
""As far as I can tell, somewhere around the late eighties or early nineties was the end of the real research related to computer viruses.
""There are businesses that want to make sure they keep making money by having cures that fix the last one, but not the next one.""

435,24,computer virus,First human 'infected with computer virus',26 May 2010,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10158517,"A British scientist says he is the first man in the world to become infected with a computer virus.
Dr Mark Gasson from the University of Reading had a chip inserted in his hand which was then infected with a virus.
The device, which enables him to pass through security doors and activate his mobile phone, is a sophisticated version of ID chips used to tag pets.
In trials, Dr Gasson showed that the chip was able to pass on the computer virus to external control systems.
If other implanted chips had then connected to the system they too would have been corrupted, he said.
Dr Gasson admits that the test is a proof of principle but he thinks it has important implications for a future where medical devices such as pacemakers and cochlear implants become more sophisticated, and risk being contaminated by other human implants.
""With the benefits of this type of technology come risks. We may improve ourselves in some way but much like the improvements with other technologies, mobile phones for example, they become vulnerable to risks, such as security problems and computer viruses.""
He also added: ""Many people with medical implants also consider them to be integrated into their concept of their body, and so in this context it is appropriate to talk in terms of people themselves being infected by computer viruses.""
However, Dr Gasson predicts that wider use will be made of implanted technology.
""This type of technology has been commercialised in the United States as a type of medical alert bracelet, so that if you're found unconscious you can be scanned and your medical history brought up.""
Professor Rafael Capurro of the Steinbeis-Transfer-Institute of Information Ethics in Germany told BBC News that the research was ""interesting"".
""If someone can get online access to your implant, it could be serious,"" he said.
Professor Capurro contributed to a 2005 ethical study for the European Commission that looked at the development of digital implants and possible abuse of them.
""From an ethical point of view, the surveillance of implants can be both positive and negative,"" he said.
""Surveillance can be part of medical care, but if someone wants to do harm to you, it could be a problem.""
In addition, he said, that there should be caution if implants with surveillance capabilities started to be used outside of a medical setting.
However, Dr Gasson believes that there will be a demand for these non-essential applications, much as people pay for cosmetic surgery.
""If we can find a way of enhancing someone's memory or their IQ then there's a real possibility that people will choose to have this kind of invasive procedure.""
Dr Gasson works at the University of Reading's School of Systems Engineering and will present the results of his research at the International Symposium for Technology and Society in Australia next month. Professor Capurro will also talk at the event.",Yes

The cause was not clear, but it is the latest in a series of mysterious incidents in Iran in recent weeks.
They have included explosions and fires at a missile facility, a power plant, a medical clinic and a nuclear complex.
The incidents have led to speculation about a campaign of sabotage.
On Monday, there was a fire at an industrial zone near the north-eastern city of Mashhad. Officials said six gas storage tanks caught fire, and that one exploded.

Bradley, of Bates Avenue, Darlington, and Harvey, of Scardale Way, Belmont, Co Durham, are due to appear before magistrates in Consett on 18 September.

The two men are accused of being part of an
international gang of computer hackers known as the THr34t-Krew.

The offences are alleged to have taken place between 1 January 2002 and February 2003, a National Hi-Tech Crime Unit spokeswoman said.

The charges allege they conspired together and with others, to effect unauthorised modifications to the contents of computers, with the intent to impair the operation of those computers.

The THr34t-Krew group is thought to be behind the creation of the TK web worm that used internet chat channels to attack other computers. 

The National Hi-Tech Crime Unit says the worm infected more than 18,000 computers. 

The worm created by the THr34t-Krew infected machines by exploiting a vulnerability in some Microsoft software. 

It was designed to provide a backdoor into any computer that had it installed.

distributed, according to experts at Hewlett-Packard in Bristol.

By the time anti-virus software catches up, the damage has already been done, they say.

New research

Most anti-virus software works by identifying unique characteristics or
patterns in the computer code that makes up a virus.

Once identified, this ""signature"" is distributed to everyone who has bought
the anti-virus software. 

However, this strategy means one needs to know what the virus
looks like before taking action against it.

The new research is the first to evaluate how effective this approach is.

The Hewlett-Packard team, led by Matthew Williamson, constructed a computer
model to ape the way in which viruses spread and were tackled by anti-virus
software.

Mr Williamson found that even if a signature was available from the moment a
virus was released, it cannot stop a virus spreading, if it propagates quickly enough.

The current crop of resistant viruses, such as Slammer and MSBlaster,
fitted into this category.

What emerged from the model was that code to combat these viruses
cannot be distributed fast enough.

Anti-virus software checks for updates no more than once an hour.

Yet too many
checks may be perceived as an attack.

 When Slammer struck in January, 78,000 machines were infected in 30 minutes.

The same virus may have infiltrated systems in NI, but not yet been activated, said the PSNI.
The warning follows Friday's cyber-attack which affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries.
The ransomware virus locked files and demanded payment to allow access and avoid data being destroyed.
The PSNI said it was working with national and international law enforcement agencies to reduce any risk to computer networks in Northern Ireland.
The police have also urged public and private sector organisations and businesses to help combat the threat of a cyber attack.
Det Ch Insp Douglas Grant, who heads up the PSNI cyber crime unit, said there is no evidence yet that the virus has infiltrated computer networks in Northern Ireland.
But he said that did not mean Northern Ireland has not been targeted.
""Thankfully we haven't experienced any of this current strain, but we must be vigilant because it could come to Northern Ireland at any point and it could have infections in our systems at the moment that just haven't activated,"" said Det Ch Insp Grant.
The PSNI said its cyber crime centre would continue to actively participate ""in the national co-ordinated response to this attack and we would encourage all local businesses and public services to take immediate steps to protect their systems and reduce their vulnerability.
""We would also recommend that businesses and industries join the local Cyber Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) so they can receive the most up to date threat and mitigation information to help protect their cyber security.""
The police said further information was available via the National Cyber Security Centre and appealed to anyone who believes they may be victims of cyber-attack to contact them.
The National Cyber Security Centre has advised companies to:

451,40,computer virus,Global virus fear prompts update for old Windows,16 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48295227,"Fears of a massive global computer virus outbreak have prompted Microsoft to issue security updates for very old versions of its Windows software.
One patch is for Windows XP, which debuted in 2001 and Microsoft stopped supporting in 2014.
Microsoft said the patch closed a hole that could be used to spread a virus.
Malicious hackers exploiting it could kick off a worldwide outbreak like the 2017 Wannacry worm, which hit thousands of machines.
It was ""highly likely"" the vulnerability would be exploited if it went unpatched, wrote Simon Pope, Microsoft's director of incident response, in a blog about the bug.
He said the bug could be exploited simply by connecting to a vulnerable machine over the internet.
""Any future malware that exploits this vulnerability could propagate from vulnerable computer to vulnerable computer in a similar way as the WannaCry malware spread across the globe in 2017,"" he said.
This danger prompted the release of a patch that closes the loophole in:
Market industry data suggests about 3.75% of desktop machines currently use XP or its variants.
Technology news site Wired said the wide range of vulnerable versions of Windows meant ""millions"" of machines were at risk.
Although Microsoft ended support for Windows XP more than five years ago, the last software patch it issued for the operating system was released just prior to the Wannacry outbreak.
""We strongly advise that all affected systems... should be updated as soon as possible,"" said Mr Pope.
Microsoft said there was no evidence that cyber-criminals were currently exploiting the loophole.
People and organisations using Windows 8 or 10 were not at risk, Microsoft said.
Independent security expert Graham Cluley said the creation of the patch for XP showed the threat of a virulent worm was ""serious"".
Many old and vulnerable systems were still ""riskily"" connected to the internet, he said, urging people to update swiftly.",Yes
452,41,computer virus,Computer virus spams mobiles,7 June 2000,http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_779000/779940.stm,"Computer viruses are starting to effect mobile phones too.

A Russian anti-virus company has found a program that tries to send junk messages to mobile phones.

The virus is rare and is unlikely to cause much damage but it is one of the first to exploit the increasing number of connections between devices we use to organise our lives.

Anti-virus experts expect that as mobile phones become more sophisticated they will be targeted by virus writers.

Some firms are already working on anti-virus software for mobile phones. 

Moscow-based Kaspersky Labs says it found the ""Timofonica"" virus in Spain.

Copycat tactics

Just like the Love Bug that caused havoc last month it only affects users of the Microsoft Outlook program. 

It also copies the Love Bug tactic of spreading itself via e-mail and arrives as a message with the subject line ""Timofonica."" 

If the attachment accompanying the message is opened the virus plunders all the e-mail addresses from Outlook and tries to mail a copy of itself to them.

For every message sent it generates another for a randomly generated numeric address at the correo.movistar.net website.

This website is a gateway that allows people to send short text messages to subscribers to the Spanish Movistar mobile phone network.

Via this route the virus tries to flood mobile phone users with useless messages or spam. 

A spokesman for anti-virus company Sophos said it had no reports of customers being hit by the virus.

He said the fact that the virus used Spanish and the recent rash of similar viruses would make people wary and unlikely to be caught out. 

Microsoft was due to unveil a program to close the loopholes that these viruses are exploiting but the release of the software has been delayed.

Moving target

Anti-virus companies are keen to point out that the virus does not copy itself to the mobile phone.

However many think it is only a matter of time before mobile phones are hit by malicious programs designed specifically for them. 

The latest mobile phones can already connect to the internet using  Wireless Application Protocol or WAP technology.

Mobile phones are starting to be used for very sensitive applications such as accessing bank balances. Soon they could be used to replace tickets or wallets.

The sophisticated phones often they have to be remotely configured by the company providing the service people sign up for.

Anti-virus companies fear that this remote control ability will be exploited by malicious programmers keen to cause havoc or steal personal information.

But the military is trying to highlight the more insidious threat of electronic warfare, which it fears that China could deploy against the island.

He said Beijing had not yet managed to penetrate the Taiwan military's computer network, even though several government internet sites were the target of mainland Chinese hackers last year.  

But General Lin said the military was earmarking a special budget next year to work on information and electronic warfare.

Increased precautions include such basic measures as warning devices that sound an alert if computer junction boxes are tampered with.

First there was the cheese worm that fixed security holes in some computers, and now comes one that looks for child pornography.

On infected machines the virus searches for image files and, if it finds any it considers suspicious, alerts law enforcement authorities by e-mail. 

But organisations that watch the web for paedophiles and child pornography say they will not react to e-mails sent to them by the virus. They warn that reacting to these messages could stop them carrying out other, more fruitful, investigations. 
Political virus

Computer viruses used to be the equivalent of graffiti sprayed on walls, and tended to be written by teenage boys. Now political activists and concerned cyber-citizens are starting to use viruses for supposedly more laudable ends.
Following Cheese was the Mawanella virus created by activists to draw attention to the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka. There has also been a virus protesting about the actions of former Philippine president Joseph Estrada. The latter two viruses both exploited the security failings of Microsoft's popular Outlook software. 

Now one virus creator has produced a program dubbed ""Noped"" that is a crude attempt to catch paedophiles and those who traffic child pornography. The virus arrives as an attachment to an email entitled ""FWD: Help us all to end illegal child porn now.""

Like the Love Bug and Melissa viruses the Noped program plunders the address book from Microsoft Outlook and attempts to e-mail a copy of itself to every name it finds there.
Image scan

On any infected machine, the virus scans the hard disk looking for any image files stored using the JPEG format. The virus checks the names of any image files it finds against a list of possibly suspicious names generated by whoever wrote the virus. 

If it finds any files that it thinks could contain child pornography, the virus randomly picks an agency known to be tackling the problem from another list, then it sends a message to that address.
 
The automatically generated message reads: ""Hi, this is Antipedo2001. I have found a PC with known Child Pornography files on the hard drive. I have included a file listing below and included a sample for your convenience"".

""The author of this would argue it's doing some good,"" said Graham Cluley of anti-virus company Sophos. ""But I do not think there is any such thing as a good virus.""
David Kerr, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, said the organisation would be unlikely to react to any e-mail it received from the virus.

If set off, the programme plunders the address book of the Microsoft Outlook e-mail programme and attempts to send itself to all the people listed there.

Virus experts say the bogus mail messages have caused the biggest outbreak since the ILoveYou virus, which struck in May 2000.
The flood of e-mail unleashed by that virus paralysed e-mail servers around the world. 

The Love Bug was successful because people were intrigued to get a message saying ""I Love You"" from people they did not know very well.

The Kournikova virus tempts users with the message: ""Hi: Check This!"", with what appears to be a picture file labelled ""AnnaKournikova.jpg.vbs"".

Clicking on the attachment sets off the virus, rather than showing an image of the tennis player.

""Some people are letting their groin do their thinking for them,"" said Graham Cluley from anti-virus company Sophos, adding that it was ""depressing"" that people could be caught out in this way.

Mr Cluley said hundreds of thousands of people had been hit by the Kournikova virus in the biggest infection since the ILoveyou outbreak last year.

He added that the virus programme was not well written or doing anything original but was successful because it played on human frailty - just like the ILoveYou virus. ""People are falling for the same old tricks,"" he said.
Anti-virus companies urged people to update the anti-virus software that scans messages sent to them and to stop files with double extensions getting through corporate firewalls and mail servers. 

The Kournikova virus looks tempting because its attachment uses the .jpg file extension which usually denotes an image. The second extension on the file "".vbs"", which shows it actually holds a small programme, is suppressed by the Microsoft Outlook programme the virus targets.

Following the virus outbreaks in 2000, Microsoft released a patch for Outlook that stopped it setting off attachments with .vbs extensions.

Fast-moving

Although the virus is not believed to damage computers, it could overwhelm companies' computer systems with the huge volume of e-mails it creates.

The virus is more correctly known as a trojan because, like the wooden horse of legend, it hides a damaging payload. It also goes by the name of VBS and SST virus, and was first discovered in August. It appeared to have originated in Europe. Variants of the trojan are now starting to turn up.
Managing director Kenny Liao said his company knew of at least 50,000 Australian computer users who had been hit.

At least 15 corporations in Australia were severely hit, including a leading retailer, an information technology firm and several non-profit organisations, said Mr Liao.

""If we look at the total number of users that have been reported to us and consider we are only contacting a small portion of the Australian population, the estimation would be more than 100,000,"" he said.

Among the organisations affected by the Love Bug were the US State Department and the CIA, the UK parliament, and major companies like Ford and Time-Warner. 

A recent report showed attacks by e-mail viruses soared by 300% last year.

Virus-monitoring company MessageLabs said it had detected and stopped 155,528 e-mail viruses by the end of November - a rate of one every three minutes.

Interserve, which helped build Birmingham's NHS Nightingale hospital, and Bam Construct, which delivered the Yorkshire and the Humber's, have reported the incidents to authorities.
Earlier this month, the government warned healthcare groups involved in the response to the virus were being targeted by malicious actors.
The separate attacks were not linked.
But Bam Construct said the ""significant"" cyber-attack on it ""forms part of the wave of attacks on public and private organisations supporting the national effort on Covid-19"".
A spokesman said the company had shut down its website and some other systems as a precaution, after being hit by a computer virus.
But its day-to-day business had remained largely unaffected.
""Our own precautions have had more of an effect on our normal working procedures than the virus itself,"" he said.
Interserve, meanwhile, said ""some operational services may be affected"".
But it was working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to ""contain and remedy the situation"" and had notified the Information Commissioner's Office and warned its employees, former employees, clients and suppliers to ""exercise heightened vigilance during this time"".

The virus has also spread to the Far East and South America.


It has also become apparent that the virus, which destroys files, scans computers for network connections and exploits these to cause further damage. This means all files on shared drives are in danger if only one connected computer activates the virus.


""It only takes one infected computer to rapidly spread within a company,"" said Mark Zajicek, a member of the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, US. ""That helps explain what we've been seeing - that the program wasn't spreading from site to site as quickly as it was within a site.""



Friend and foe
The main method of virus infection was initially a seemingly friendly e-mail that tricked the recipient into opening an infected file and starting the virus program.


But the researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that the virus would reappear seconds after being removed from a computer - if that machine was linked to another infected machine.


It is now likely to take weeks rather than days to conquer the virus says Dan Schrader at Trend Micro, a maker of anti-virus software.


But he admitted it was ""a very complex bit of code"" and even his own company fell prey to the virus.


False sense of security

The virus propagates in the same way as the Melissa virus that infected computers worldwide earlier this year.


It uses your e-mail address books to send itself to people you correspond with. They get a personalised message which appears to come from you. 
What to look out for: the deceptively friendly email

This can give people a false sense of security, leading them to forget a golden rule of virus protection - do not open files unless you are certain where they have come from.


Unlike the Melissa virus, the Explore.Zip virus carries a destructive payload. It not only destroys Microsoft software files including Word, Excel and Powerpoint files but also several types of programming code files (*.c, *.cpp, and *.asm) which are much harder to replace.


No normal recovery

Furthermore, Catherine Hampton from the alt.comp.virus newsgroup says that ""it deletes files in a special way which means they can't be recovered by any of the normal file undelete or file recovery software available.""


Computers which use alternatives (e.g. Linux) to Microsoft operating systems are not affected by the virus.


The impact of the virus on the many businesses affected is still being assessed. But the cost of recovering or replacing lost data, disinfecting computer systems and lost working time is likely to be huge. 


Malicious viruses are becoming a regular burden on businesses and police authorities are putting a lot of effort into tracing the creator of Explore.Zip. 

The people behind the recent Melissa and Chernobyl viruses were quickly caught, but there is no reported progress in the current case.

Officials said they believed the ransomware was sent in a malicious email link, clicked by an employee.
The US Coast Guard (USCG) issued a security bulletin on 16 December, urging other bases to take measures to prevent further attacks.
""Once the embedded malicious link in the email was clicked by an employee, the ransomware allowed for a threat actor to access significant enterprise information technology (IT) network files, and encrypt them, preventing the facility's access to critical files,"" it said.

Researchers at cyber-security company Secureworks say they reached their conclusion after analysing a new strain of computer virus.
They claim the culprits are the GandCrab crew.
The gang is thought to be Russian and previously sold customised ransomware to other criminals.
Their code had scrambled data on victims' computers and demanded blackmail payments to decrypt it. It is estimated to have affected more than 1.5 million machines, with hospitals among those affected.
In May, the group had surprised many in the security industry when it announced it was ""retiring"" after earning more than $2bn (Â£1.6bn) from the trade.
Someone claiming to be part of the group claimed it had ""cashed out"" its earnings and quit the business.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was a ""matter for the victim"" as to whether a ransom had been paid.

Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files. Messages sent by the perpetrators demand a payment in order to unlock the frozen accounts.
Eurofins deals with over 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year.
It carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK.
Forensic science work has been carried out by private firms and police laboratories in England and Wales since the closure of the government's Forensic Science Service in 2012.
An emergency police response to the cyber-attack was led by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) to manage the flow of forensic submissions so DNA and blood samples which needed urgent testing were sent to other suppliers.
It has led to delays in forensic science provision and is understood to have caused some court hearings to be postponed because information on the results of analysis conducted by Eurofins was not accessible.
The ransom is likely to have been paid between 10 June, when Eurofins issued a lengthy statement about the attack, and June 24 when it published an optimistic update, saying it had ""identified the variant of the malware used"" in the attack and had strengthened cyber-security.
It said: ""We are continuing to work intensively with leading cybersecurity experts to further secure our current systems and infrastructure and to add enhanced security features and measures to protect our systems and data.""
""The investigations conducted so far by our internal and external IT forensics experts have not found evidence of any unauthorised theft or transfer of confidential client data.""
The NPCC refused to comment on the ransom payment but police sources said ""excellent progress"" had been made in dealing with the fall-out of the cyber attack.
Police and law enforcement agencies in the UK are still not submitting new samples to Eurofins for analysis but the company says it is working towards giving them the assurances they need for fresh work to restart.
The Crown Prosecution Service said: ""We are working to make sure all hearings remain fair and based on reliable evidence. While investigations are ongoing, prosecutors will assess the impact on a case by case basis.
""Cases where forensic evidence does not play a major role will continue as âusual if all parties agree.
""If âtest results provided by Eurofins are central, we will seek to adjourn cases for the shortest possible period.""
Eurofins is the third major forensic science problem to hit law enforcement following the collapse of Key Forensic Services and a criminal investigation into alleged irregularities at Randox Testing.",Yes

Eurofins Scientific was targeted by a ""highly-sophisticated"" ransomware virus in June, which led British police to suspend work with the company.
The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) is now clearing the backlog, which includes blood and DNA specimens.
It warned of delays to police investigations and court cases.
The NPCC said it decided three weeks ago that it was safe for police forces to use the firm again.
Since then, it has managed to reduce the backlog to 15,000.
The ""overwhelming majority"" of cases - which include specimens from suspects and evidence from crime scenes - will be cleared within two months, the police body added.
The NPCC lead for the forensic marketplace, Assistant Chief Constable Paul Gibson, said: ""The security and integrity of the criminal justice system is of the highest possible priority, which meant we had to take stringent steps to ensure that police data had, firstly, not been manipulated or changed and, secondly, was suitably protected for the future.""

Because the virus is known to be lurking on more than 300,000 PCs, this scanning could generate large amounts of net traffic as it activates.

The Nyxem-E virus has been racking up victims since it emerged on 16 January.


A website associated with the virus has been keeping count of the machines it has managed to infect and now this counter stands at more than 300,000 victims.

Unlike many other recent Windows viruses, Nyxem-E has been built to delete many popular types of file. Security firms suggest it was written to target businesses because many of the file types it deletes, spreadsheets and presentations, are more common in firms than homes.

However, because many companies have good security systems in place home users are more likely to be caught out. The virus only affects Windows users who must open an infected attachment on an e-mail message to fall victim.

The creators of the virus have tried to trick people into opening the attachments by falsely claiming they contain a variety of pornographic images or videos.

Security firm Lurhq has analysed the data sent to the website counting victims and found that most are in Peru, Turkey and India. Many other nations are reporting infected machines too.

Some unlucky users have already fallen victim to Nyxem-E because the clock on their machine is set to the wrong time.

When the virus strikes it will also start scanning local computer networks for other machines to infect. This could cause problems for some users as the data generated swamps net links.

UK net service firm Easynet has started telling customers if they are using an infected computer and urging them to clean it up and remove the bug.

Security firms said users needed to be vigilant but not panic because many other Windows viruses have been far more successful at infecting machines but have not caused significant problems for the net.

Despite the furore over Nyxem-E, Microsoft said it was not planning to update its malicious software removal tools before the date that the virus is set to strike.

Instead, the next version of the tool which is due to be released on 14 February will spot and remove the worm if it finds it on a PC.

Writing in Prospect Magazine, he said such an incident would trigger a ""collective defence commitment"", known as Article 5 of its founding treaty.
Article 5 has not been triggered since the 9/11 terror attacks on the US in 2001.
Nato's members include the US, Canada and many European countries.
""We have designated cyber-space a domain in which Nato will operate and defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea,"" he wrote in his article.
It's not the first time Mr Stoltenberg has made this claim.
As an example of a major cyber-incident, he mentioned the 2017 Wannacry ransomware attack which crippled the NHS in the UK and caused havoc around the world, although this did not trigger Article 5 at the time.
US President Donald Trump has previously criticised the 70-year-old military alliance, saying the US contributes more funding to it than any other member country.
Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera
The idea that an attack on one is an attack on all underpins Nato - but adapting it to cyber-space raises complicated issues.
In the Cold War, a missile launch or a tank column advancing would have left little doubt of what constituted an attack.
But in the cyber-world it is not always so easy.
When Estonia saw its infrastructure hit through cyber-space in 2007, it was blamed on Russia. But was it the Russian state or ""patriotic hackers"" operating within Russia? And at whose direction?
Another issue is the threshold for considering something an attack.
Russia is accused of turning off a power station in (non-Nato member) Ukraine in December 2015. The crippling of infrastructure is one possibility for reaching a threshold for Article 5.
But what of 2017 when Russia is alleged to have launched the Notpetya computer virus against Ukraine but which then spilled over into other countries (including Nato members) damaging businesses at a cost of billions of dollars?",Yes

The evidence is comments he made in an interview after the FBI arrested him.
He wanted the testimony discounted, claiming he gave it when ""intoxicated"".
A court ruling issued earlier this week threw out the request saying there was no evidence that he was under the influence of drugs.
FBI agents arrested Mr Hutchins on 2 August 2017 at Las Vegas's McCarran International Airport as he was starting his journey home after attending the Def Con hacker conference. He has been held in the US ever since his arrest.
He faces 10 charges related to malware, or malicious software, including a program called Kronos which is designed to steal banking credentials.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Judge JP Stadtmueller wrote: ""Hutchins appeared to be alert, engaged, co-ordinated, and coherent,"" in his ruling, tech news site Ars Technica recorded.
The judge added that there was no evidence that Mr Hutchins was under the influence of drugs but was rather suffering a ""terrible hangover"". This did not render him unable to understand the procedure or be fully aware of why he was being quizzed, said the judge.

Mark Vartanyan, 29, developed and distributed the Citadel Trojan, which lets criminals steal bank account details and hold files to ransom.
US prosecutors said it had infected about 11 million computers worldwide.
He pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud, in a court in Atlanta, after being extradited from Norway.
Launched in 2011, Citadel was marketed on invitation-only, Russian-language internet forums used by cybercriminals.
Its users had targeted the computer networks of major financial and government institutions around the world, prosecutors said.
Vartanyan admitted to the ""development, improvement, maintenance and distribution"" of Citadel between 2012 and 2014 while living in Ukraine and Norway.
Operating under the alias Kolypto, he uploaded ""numerous electronic files"" that consisted of Citadel malware, components, updates and patches, as well as customer information.
Earlier in March, David LeValley, special agent at the FBI Atlanta Office, said Vartanyan's arrest removed ""a significant player"" from the resources available to cybercriminals.
""We must continue to impose real costs on criminals who believe they are protected by geographic boundaries and can prey on the American people,"" he said.
Vartanyan agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison term. He will be sentenced in June.

The attack led to delayed distribution of The Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and other titles belonging to Tribune Publishing.
The company said it first detected the malware on Friday, which hit papers sharing the same printing plant.
The attack is believed to have come from outside the US, the LA Times said.
West Coast editions of the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which share the same production platform in Los Angeles, were also affected.
""We believe the intention of the attack was to disable infrastructure, more specifically servers, as opposed to looking to steal information,"" an anonymous source with knowledge of the attack told the LA Times.

472,61,computer virus,Did Donald Trump tweet classified military imagery?,30 August 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49532408,"President Donald Trump has set a new standard for extraordinary presidential behaviour.
Not only has he tweeted what would normally be a highly classified, military-quality satellite image showing the devastation around the launch pad at Iran's main space centre following a significant explosion.
He has gone further by apparently taunting the Iranians, insisting the US was not involved in the ""catastrophic accident"" but also wishing Iran ""good luck"" in finding out what happened.
Was this presidential sarcasm or misinformation?
Was he implying that somebody else might indeed have been involved?
Or was it just the president's regular habit of responding by saying the first thing that came into his head?
It's hard to say. But, as ever, Mr Trump's intervention raises more questions than it answers.
For some weeks now experts have been reporting preparations for an Iranian space launch.
Commercial satellite imagery of the space centre showed the launch pad being made ready.
The mission, according to Iranian reports, was to put a small telecommunications satellite - Nahid 1 - into orbit.
Two previous launch attempts at the start of this year had ended in failure.
This one, too, appears now to have ended in disaster. The difference, though, is that the full magnitude of the calamity has been revealed by President Trump himself.
So what caused Iran's rocket to explode so dramatically on the launchpad?
We simply do not know. But there are two obvious answers.
Firstly it could have been down to a simple technical malfunction; a problem with fuel or some kind of error in the rocket's manufacture - a faulty weld seam or whatever.
These things happen; think back to some of the disasters during America's own space programme. Even the most technologically advanced nations have setbacks.
But Iran's track record with launches is very poor.
A New York Times article back in February, drawing heavily on interviews with unnamed US officials, suggested that Iran's two earlier failures this year were part of a pattern.
It suggested that some 67% of Iran's orbital launch attempts over the past 11 years had failed.
It described this as ""an astonishingly high number"" compared to the average 5% failure rate for comparable launches worldwide.""
The article indicated that the Trump administration was moving to reactivate a sabotage programme against Iran's missile efforts by introducing faulty parts into the supply chain and so on.
A previous US effort had been phased out by President Obama.
So could sabotage be implicated in this latest accident?  Who knows, but Mr Trump himself has only muddied the waters by his Twitter intervention.
There is a significant history of external forces attempting to hamper Iran's military research.
Israel and the US were involved in efforts to sabotage Iran's uranium enrichment programme using a computer virus.
Iranian scientists and technicians have been assassinated.
And of course both the US and Israel see Iran's space programme as inextricably linked to its wider missile efforts.
However, the most extraordinary aspect of this affair is the president's publication of a normally classified high-resolution satellite image that could only have come from a military source.
This has thrown the missile and arms control community on the Twitter-sphere into a frenzy.
It is an amazing thing for a US president to do, giving all Washington's enemies a very public insight into its extraordinary intelligence-gathering capabilities.",Yes

The woman, Yujing Zhang, 32, told security she was at the Florida club to go to the pool, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court.
""Due to a potential language barrier issue,"" staff believed she was related to a club member and let her in.
Mr Trump was in Palm Beach at the time of the incident on Saturday 30 March.
Ms Zhang - who was described in the affidavit as an ""Asian female"" - is charged with making false statements to a federal officer and illegally entering a restricted area.
According to the court documents, upon entry to the club Ms Zhang changed her story, telling a front-desk receptionist she was there to attend a ""United Nations Chinese American Association"" event.
The receptionist, who knew that such an event had been scheduled, became suspicious of Ms Zhang.
The suspect was transported off the property for further questioning.
She told agents she had been instructed by a friend, identified only as ""Charles"", to travel from Shanghai, China, to Palm Beach to attend the purported United Nations event, but did not provide any more details, according to court documents.
She said ""Charles"" had encouraged her to attempt to speak to a member of the president's family about Chinese-American economic relations, said the affidavit.
Secret service agent Samuel Ivanovich said Ms Zhang carried four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing a computer virus, but no swim suit.
In the court document, Mr Ivanovich notes that Ms Zhang ""freely and without difficulty conversed"" in English, becoming ""verbally aggressive"" with authorities as the investigation progressed.

The suspension has led to delays in forensic testing, which could impact on court cases.
Eurofins Forensic Services carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK.
Its parent company, Eurofins, suffered a ransomware attack on 1 or 2 June, which is under criminal investigation.
Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to unlock access.
It is the latest in a series of major forensic science problems to hit police forces since the closure of the government-owned service in England and Wales in 2012.
An emergency police response has been put in place, led by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which took the decision to ""temporarily suspend"" all submissions to Eurofins.
Eurofins, which caters for over 50% of the UK market, deals with over 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year.
A group of senior officers will ensure the most serious crimes are given priority, as well as ensuring other forensic providers aren't overloaded with submissions.
""Our priority is to minimise the impact on the criminal justice system,"" said the NPCC lead for forensics, Chief Constable James Vaughan.
""It is too early to fully quantify the impact but we are working at pace with partners to understand and mitigate the risks.""
The Crown Prosecution Service said a police investigation was ongoing, but at this stage there was ""no evidence to suggest that previous convictions were unsafe"".
A spokesperson added: ""The CPS is assessing current cases to identify any impact on criminal trials as a result of this attack, and will ensure all necessary action is taken to allow them to proceed fairly.""
Eurofins said the attack ""caused disruption to many of its IT systems in several countries"" in a statement on it website.
It said it believed the attack was carried out by ""highly sophisticated well-resourced perpetrators"" and the ransomware involved appears to have been a ""new malware variant"".
The National Crime Agency is conducting an investigation into the cyber attack, supported by the National Cyber Security Centre.
A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with law enforcement and justice partners to investigate the sources of the attack and minimise any impact on our criminal justice system.""
Forensic science work has been carried out by private firms and police laboratories in England and Wales since the closure of the government's Forensic Science Service in 2012.
Last year 40 drug-driving offences were quashed and thousands of cases were reviewed after data was allegedly manipulated at Randox Testing Services.
Another company - Key Forensic Services - collapsed in January 2018, while the Met Police also had to carry out a review after a forensic scientist apparently botched examinations.
Eurofins has seven laboratories in the UK - Teddington, south-west London; Leeds Dock, in Leeds; Risley, Cheshire; Wakefield, west Yorkshire; Culham, Oxfordshire; Fordham, Cambridgeshire; Tamworth, Staffordshire.

The software shares the cards with the virus's creators who then join the same game and try to fleece the victim.
The sneaky malware has been found lurking in software designed to help poker fans play better, said the security firm that found it.
The software also targets other useful information on a victim's computer such as login names and passwords.
The malware targets players of the Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker sites, said Robert Lipovsky, a security researcher at Eset, in a blogpost.
When it infects a machine, the software monitors the PC's activity and springs to life when a victim has logged in to either one of the two poker sites. It then starts taking screenshots of their activity and the cards they are dealt. Screenshots are then sent to the attacker.
The images show the hand the player has been dealt as well as their player ID. This, said Eset, allows the attacker to search the sites for that player and join their game. Using information about a victim's hand gives the attacker a significant advantage.
""We are unsure whether the perpetrator plays the games manually or in some automated way,"" wrote Mr Lipovsky.
Eset found the Windows malware lurking in some well-known file-sharing applications, PC utilities as well as several widely used poker calculators and player databases.

A successful attacker would be able to change the amount of anaesthetic delivered to a patient, CyberMDX said.
Alarms designed to alert anaesthetists to any danger could also be silenced.
GE Healthcare, which makes the machines, said there was no ""direct patient risk"".
But CyberMDX's research suggested the Aespire and Aestiva 7100 and 7900 devices could be targeted by hackers if left accessible on hospital computer networks.
And analysis by BBC News found multiple references online to the Aespire and Aestiva machines being used in NHS Hospitals.
Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust confirmed to the BBC that ""a small number"" of the devices were currently in use at its facilities, but were being phased out.
""None of the anaesthetic machines are connected to the internet or the NUH network so there is very little risk around these machines within NUH,"" a spokesman told the BBC.
NHS Digital said it could not confirm the extent to which the machines were still in use across the NHS.
""We are currently assessing the volume of these particular anaesthetic machines in use across England and we will be sharing any subsequent advice with trusts in the coming days,"" a spokeswoman said.
Elad Luz, head of research at CyberMDX, said he was aware of hospitals in the US and Asia that also used the devices.
GE Healthcare said it was satisfied a cyber-attack would ""not introduce clinical hazard or patient risk"".
It said this was because anaesthetic devices were ""attended"" by anaesthetists and would be monitored for any errors.
The company told BBC News it did not plan to release any security updates for the anaesthetic machines but hospitals should use secure network protocols to protect them from would-be hackers.
Cyber-security expert Ken Munro agreed that medical devices should be isolated within computer networks but added: ""It's not, frankly, the case in many hospital networks.""
And he said GE Healthcare should bear some responsibility for the issue.
""GE absolutely have a part to play in this and they absolutely should be building devices with strong security,"" Mr Munro added.
A malicious hacker may try to gain access to a hospital's network, locate one of the machines and then adjust its settings, said Prof Harold Thimbleby, an expert in medical device cyber-security, at Swansea University.
And he gave the example of WannaCry, a ransomware outbreak that spread through NHS computer networks in 2017, to illustrate how an attack could unfold.
""As with WannaCry, a phishing attack can gain access and then an attacker can do what they like,"" he told BBC News.
""Given the worldwide profile of WannaCry, it is amazing vulnerabilities like this are still around.""
The likelihood of harm being caused to a patient through any hacking of the devices was ""incredibly small"" said Dr Helgi Johannsson, consultant anaesthetist and Royal College of Anaesthetists Council Member.
""Patients should be reassured that their anaesthetist will be monitoring them constantly, and will have received many years of training to rectify immediately the situation of a device failure.""
A spokeswoman for the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said reports of the cyber-security vulnerability were now part of an ""ongoing area of investigation"".
""Patient safety is our highest priority and where necessary we will take action to protect public health,"" she added.

Teofil Bortos, 36, of Cheltenham Gardens, Newham, east London, was in a gang that targeted 51 ATMs across England in the space of five days, the Old Bailey heard.
Bortos, who admitted conspiracy to defraud ATM provider Cardtronics UK, was sentenced to seven years in prison.

If Rombertik's evasion techniques are triggered, it deletes key files on a computer, making it constantly restart.
Analysts said Rombertik was ""unique"" among malware samples for resisting capture so aggressively.
On Windows machines where it goes unnoticed, the malware steals login data and other confidential information.
Rombertik typically infected a vulnerable machine after a booby-trapped attachment on a phishing message had been opened, security researchers Ben Baker and Alex Chiu, from Cisco, said in a blogpost.
Some of the messages Rombertik travels with pose as business enquiry letters from Microsoft.
The malware ""indiscriminately"" stole data entered by victims on any website, the researchers said.
And it got even nastier when it spotted someone was trying to understand how it worked.
""Rombertik is unique in that it actively attempts to destroy the computer if it detects certain attributes associated with malware analysis,"" the researchers said.
The malware regularly carries out internal checks to see if it is under analysis.
If it believes it is, it will attempt to delete an essential Windows system file called the Master Boot Record (MBR).
It will then restart the machine which, because the MBR is missing, will go into an endless restart loop.
The code replacing the MBR makes the machine print out a message mocking attempts to analyse it.
Restoring a PC with its MBR deleted involves reinstalling Windows, which could mean important data is lost.
Rombertik also uses other tricks to foil analysis.
One involves writing a byte of data to memory 960 million times to overwhelm analysis tools that try to spot malware by logging system activity.
Security expert Graham Cluley said destructive viruses such as Rombertik were quite rare.
""It's not the norm,"" he said.
""That's because malware these days doesn't want to draw attention to itself, as that works against its typical goal - to lie in wait, stealing information for a long time.""",Yes

The malware targets 40 separate games including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft and World of Tanks.

But analysis of the malware, called Teslacrypt, reveals that it shares no code with Cryptolocker and appears to be have been created by a different cybercrime group.
Researcher Vadim Kotov from security firm Bromium said the file was catching people out via a website its creators had managed to compromise. The site involved is a Wordpress blog that is inadvertently hosting a file that abuses a loophole in Flash to infect visitors.
One a machine is infected, wrote Mr Kotov, the malware looks for 185 different file extensions. In particular, it seeks out files associated with many popular video games and online services such as Steam that give people access to them.
""Interestingly, although these are all popular games, none of them matches any particular 'Top Sellers' or 'Most Played' chart, "" said Mr Kotov. ""They could just be games the developer loves to play.""
Files holding gamers' profiles, maps, saves and modified versions of games are all sought by Teslacrypt, he said.
He said anyone who tries to outwit the malware by uninstalling a game they obtained via an online service may end up disappointed.
""Often it's not possible to restore this kind of data even after re-installing a game via Steam,"" he wrote.
Once target files are encrypted the malware pops up a window telling victims they have a few days to pay up and retrieve their data.
To decrypt, victims can either pay $500 in Bitcoins or $1,000 in Paypal My Cash payment cards. The virus tells victims to send payment details to an address located on the Tor anonymous browsing network.
The encryption system used by Teslacrypt has yet to be cracked meaning victims would have to turn to back-ups to restore scrambled files.",Yes
481,70,computer virus,The cyber kidnappers: The day hackers hijacked my phone,4 March 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35720073,"Something wasn't right about the phone screen. It had gone dark. That's when Nick Harvey examined it more closely. It looked odd. And it was then that he saw the message.
His smart phone had, in effect, been hijacked and he was being asked to pay a ransom.
""My device had been locked"", he told BBC Radio 4's PM Programme.
He was being instructed ""to send some money via a voucher code to get the phone unlocked"".
Ken Main knows how Nick felt. It happened to him with the computers at his hairdressing salon in Glasgow.
""It was a pale blue screen with the message right in the middle,"" he explained. ""If we wanted the information back we would have to pay a ransom.""
They had both become victims of what is known as ransomware - a type of computer virus which unlocks the users out of their computers or phones and demands money for the return of the files.
""It's like somebody breaking into your house"", Ken said."" It was a message which kind of created the same sort of emotional fear and then you start thinking 'God, what happens if I can't get this information back?'""
You are probably now trying to guess how much Ken and Nick were being asked to pay. It is possibly quite a lot lower than you would think.
""They asked me for $50 or â¬50"" Nick recalled.
For Ken it was slightly more.
""They were looking for a ransom of $350 initially,"" he said. ""When we contacted them by email, they put that up to â¬1000.""
The demands are set at what is regarded as a payable level, according to Jornt van der Wiel from the security software company, Kaspersky Lab.
They tend to be for ""the amount of money that people are still willing to pay in order to get their files back.""
He explained, for a small business, ""Sometimes it's cheaper for the company just to pay the ransom than to put back the backup because that in the end costs more"".
Nick Harvey did not have to part with any money. He managed to get his phone working again although he did lose some data. Ken, however, felt he had no choice but to pay up.
""I said, 'Well I need that bloody information back. I've got a business to run here.' I think any businessman in my position would say 'Yes! Let's do it', because I've got no other way of getting information to rebuild that database.""
According to Mr van der Wiel, ransomware can enter your computer via malicious email attachments. His advice is not to open any file which you are suspicious about. He says there can also be a problem if the latest ""security patches"" on your internet browser have not been installed.
Such are the difficulties that a ransomware attack can create; even those responsible for enforcing the law have given into the criminals.
When the systems at the police department in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, were affected, computer experts tried everything but to no avail.
""We couldn't restore it from an external back-up"" Chief Timothy Sheehan said ""because that was also corrupted and the taped back-up we had was at least 18 months old. We realised we were in a perfect storm. We were in a very bad situation.""
The police department paid the ransom via a third party.
""Ultimately we decided that in our particular situation we should take the shot of paying the 500 dollars in bitcoin and see if we got the decryption key returned to us and we could return all of the data that was encrypted back to its normal status.""
Chief Sheehan conceded that it meant paying money to criminals and he now wants to highlight the threat ransomware poses.
According to Raj Samani, Intel Security's chief technology officer in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, those behind ransomware are making hundreds of millions of dollars. He said there has been ""enormous growth in ransomware certainly over the last 12 months"".
He believes people in the UK are particularly vulnerable. There are many different types of ransomware viruses but according to Mr Samani ""in almost every single type we look at, the UK is either second or third on that list, so I would argue that the UK is targeted disproportionately  with regards to the number of internet users that we have.""
Security experts have found ways of unlocking some forms of ransomware but those behind the cyber criminals are developing more sophisticated viruses too.
Back in the hairdressers in Glasgow, Ken Main has no regrets about paying the ransom. However, it didn't solve all his problems. Do not think paying up means all will end well.
""I would say 80 to 90% of the information was corrupted"" he said. ""In terms of hard cash income I would say we were probably down by about Â£20,000.""",Yes
482,71,computer virus,Iran nuclear talks: Israel denies bugging venues,11 June 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33090381,"Israel has denied it bugged talks on Iran's nuclear programme, after a security company said a computer virus hacked the venues of the negotiations.
The Russian firm Kaspersky Lab said the hacking at three European hotels was so sophisticated, it must have been created by a government.
World powers and Iran have been holding talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear programme ahead of a 30 June deadline.
Switzerland and Austria have both opened investigations into the hacks.
The US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China are seeking a final agreement to curtail Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
They fear Iran wants to build a nuclear bomb - something Iran strongly denies.
Israel is not a party to the negotiations although it feels particularly threatened by the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran.
In March, the Wall Street Journal reported concerns by US officials that Israel had been spying on the behind-closed-doors talks.
At the time, Israel denied the claims it had been spying.
Kaspersky, and an American security firm, Symantec, believe the so-called Duqu 2.0 software was employed to gather information.
The virus infects computers across a network and is difficult to detect.
Kaspersky said on Wednesday that its own systems had recently been compromised by hackers but the intrusion had been detected at an early stage.
Security experts had previously speculated that Duqu may have been created by Israel or the US.
""The international reports of Israeli involvement in the matter are baseless,"" said Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's deputy foreign minister.
""What is much more important is that we prevent a bad agreement where at the end of the day we find ourselves with an Iranian nuclear umbrella.""
Karl-Heinz Grundboeck, a spokesman for Austria's interior ministry, told AFP investigations in Vienna were focused on the Palais Coburg hotel, where talks took place in July last year.
Switzerland's attorney general has also opened an investigation, although it is not known which Swiss hotels are affected.
Police have seized computers in Switzerland.
As well as Vienna, negotiations have been held in the Swiss cities of Geneva, Lausanne and Montreux, and in Germany.",Yes
483,72,computer virus,Durham Sixth Form Centre paid ransom after cyber-attack,9 May 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-44045355,"A school paid out Â£1,500 in ransom money after it fell victim to a cyber-attack, the BBC has learned.
Durham Sixth Form Centre was hit in the run-up to exams in April 2017 when a computer virus encrypted college files which contained students' work.
The County Durham school confirmed it had made the payment and that it had informed police about the hack.
Durham Police has not commented on the case, but a spokesman said it would not recommend a ransom be paid.
Phil Butler, a former police officer and cyber-crime expert at Roxburgh Forensics, said it was ""madness"" the payout was made by the school, which had responded to a Freedom of Information request from BBC Newcastle.
He said: ""You're exposing yourself to a whole world of pain, becoming an easy target for future attacks, and not only that you're encouraging the criminality, actually potentially facilitating money laundering.""
Student Tommy Davis said his grade in his IT A-level suffered because his coursework was never recovered.
""They tried to decrypt it but they were never able to, so basically all the IT coursework I left over there to get marked was gone,"" he said.
""So I didn't get the marks I'd actually done work for.""
Lewis Russ, 19, was about to take his A-levels when the attack happened.
Mr Russ said: ""Rumours started going round to say we've been hacked and they've taken all of our files, which was quite alarming considering the fact that I took lots of subjects which had literally all my work on the computers.""
His work was recovered and he is now studying at Northumbria University.
The school has not confirmed the source of the attack, but it happened at the same time as the global WannaCry cyber-attack on businesses and banks across the world, as well as the NHS.
In relation to that, Mr Butler said: ""We weren't dealing with computer nerds sat in a dark bedroom somewhere.
""The USA Department of Homeland Security believe North Korea was behind this attack, so it was a state-sponsored terrorist attack upon the western world essentially so it wasn't just the school that was affected. It was a really serious attack.""
Durham County Council has refused to comment on the school's case as it manages its own IT system.",Yes

When the computer virus struck on Friday 47 trusts were affected and seven had to close their doors in A&E to ambulances.
Some routine surgery and GP appointments were also cancelled across the NHS in the aftermath.
Services are returning to normal, but some places are still having problems.
The ransomware program demanded a payment worth Â£230 to unlock the affected computers.
Hackers wanted their payment in the virtual currency Bitcoin, which is harder to trace.
At the time Prime Minister Theresa May said it was not an attack targeted at the NHS.
She said it was an international attack with a number of countries and organisations affected.
National incident director Dr Anne Rainsberry said: ""Patients are no longer being diverted away from hospital accident and emergency units and, while there is still some disruption in a small number of areas, most patients are being treated as normal.
""We are grateful for the hard work of staff at trusts and GP practices who are still suffering IT issues but have found ways to work around this, as well as the patience of people who have been affected.""",Yes
485,74,computer virus,'I kept my multimillion dollar business secret',22 July 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49015609,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Marcin Kleczynski, chief executive and co-founder of US antivirus software company Malwarebytes.
A lot of entrepreneurs have ""a moment"". A moment that makes them realise they're on to something.
For Marcin Kleczynski it came while he was discreetly working on his antivirus software business from his student digs.
His start-up company Malwarebytes was less than a year old back in late 2008, but already gaining a good reputation in the cyber security world.
Marcin, then only 18, was just about managing to juggle running his start-up with participating in student life at the University of Illinois when he hit a snag.
""I was having some real trouble analysing the latest computer virus, when all of a sudden I get a white page on my screen that says 'you've been banned from the school network due to malicious activity on your desktop',"" he says.
""They'd obviously detected that I had a virus on my computer, but didn't realise it was deliberate. So I call the university IT helpline, and they send a kid, no older than me. He sits down at my computer and looks at it and says 'boy you've really screwed this thing up'.
""Then, right in front of me, he logs onto my website and downloads Malwarebytes.
""I didn't say anything, I stood behind him and watched him fix my computer with my software to get me back online. He left never knowing who I was, but to this day I love that moment.""
By the time Marcin graduated with a degree in computer science in 2012, he had quietly grown Malwarebytes into a business earning a few million dollars a year. All without any of his lecturers having any idea what was taking up his time, and pushing his grades down.
Today the company has an annual turnover of more than $126m, and millions of customers around the world.
Born in Poland in 1989, Marcin moved to the US with his family when he was three, settling in Chicago.
As a gaming-obsessed teenager, he'd accidentally got a virus when he was 14, and learned everything he needed to know about computer bugs from internet forums and a ""For Dummies"" book.
Formally launching Malwarebytes in January 2008 when he was just 18, it grew quickly, and he decided that starting university in September of that year would just slow him down. His mother had other thoughts.
""The business was becoming real, and so I went sheepishly to my mum and said 'I don't think I'm going to go to school',"" says Marcin. ""Fifteen seconds later we were packing my stuff and I was going to school.""
What made Mrs Kleczynski initially more alarmed was that her teenage son had launched the business with a man in his 30s called Bruce Harrison. Marcin and Bruce had been writing software together for more than a year, after they first started talking on anti-virus forums.
""Here's this 17-year-old kid... he's this 35-year-old man. Imagine telling your mum?..."" says Marcin.
More The Boss features:
Marcin and Bruce hadn't actually met in person at the time. Bruce was a computer repairman in Massachusetts, and Marcin was at home in Chicago. They didn't in fact see each other in the flesh until Malwarebytes was more than 12 months old.
""We didn't meet until we made our first million about a year after we launched the product,"" says Marcin. ""Even that was kind of anti-climatic. It was just, 'Hey, Bruce!' - We had a handshake and moved on.""
Today Bruce, who is head of research, still lives and works on the US east coast, while Marcin is based in the head office in Silicon Valley. The company now has more than 750 employees, and overseas offices in the Republic of Ireland, Singapore and Estonia. Since 2014 it has secured $80m of investment funding.
Malwarebytes says its software now performs 187 million virus scans every month for individuals and businesses, and is installed more than 247,000 times every day. Like many antivirus companies it operates a ""freemium"" business model - the basic version is free, but you can then pay for more advanced protection.
While the company has consistently grown strongly, Marcin has learned some hard lessons along the way. The most difficult time was navigating the business through an almost catastrophic period in 2014 where the product glitched on a huge scale.
""We had a false positive which means we detected a piece of malicious software that wasn't actually malicious at all,"" he says.
""Our software ended up mistakenly bringing down hundreds of thousands of computers. We had 911 emergency centres go down, hospitals go down, it was bad. This has happened to every anti-virus company, by the way, but these mistakes can be company killing because you lose trust.
""But we fixed it and got through it. Even today, the system that we created to prevent this from happening again is called 'The Malwarebytes Extinction Prevention System' - our engineers have a great sense of humour.""
Carl Gottlieb, a cyber security podcaster, says that despite operating in the ""notoriously hostile"" antivirus industry ""Malwarebytes is thriving"".
""With so many competing vendors, brand awareness is key, and that step [which Malwarebytes took] to offer a free product years ago is paying dividends, with so many customers knowing the name and already using it in their homes. What Marcin and his team have achieved is impressive to see.""
Still only 29, Marcin says his young age has been an advantage. He encourages other budding teen entrepreneurs to start their own business.
""You've heard my story, I started the company when I was living with my parents,"" he says. ""And then even at college, it was all paid for on a student loan, so I was getting fed. If you're in college now, instead of going out and getting drunk with your friends, maybe take one night a week just to see if there's anything you want to work on personally.""
He admits that his university years were harder than his friends', that he barely passed his degree, and his social life no doubt suffered. However, he's glad his mum forced him to go. ""For one thing, I met my wife there,"" he says.",Yes
486,75,computer virus,A phone call for Mr Sellan,11 November 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15690898,"The phone rang at home the other day, and when I picked it up a voice down a crackly line asked if a ""Mr Sellan"" was there. He then proceeded to tell me that a problem had been detected with my Windows computer. Having had similar calls before, I thought I knew what was coming.
So instead of putting the phone down, I decided to play along and record the call. The man at the other end told me to go to my computer and type in a complex series of instructions.
Then he asked me if I was seeing a certain string of letters and numbers. ""Ooh yes,"" I said. That was proof, he told me, that my computer was sending out the error message that his company had received - and which had led him to call in the first place.
So I then sought to find out what he was suggesting I do about my badly infected computer.
""We will first have to check out the problems and what it will take to fix them,"" he told me.
That might cost nothing or just a minimum charge but if I wanted complete protection over a longer period that would be Â£159.
At that point, I decided to reveal that I had been stringing him along. I do not have a Windows computer at home, so I had not been typing in the instructions - though when a colleague tried it later on a PC at work following the same commands, he came up with same string of numbers and letters.
The man at the other end was first bemused, then rather cross. He accused me of wasting his time and energy, then when I asked for a telephone number to contact his firm's PR department, he terminated the call.
Now this is a well-known scam, which can involve selling you software you don't need or even having your computer taken over for malicious purposes. There are plenty of warnings from Microsoft and from security experts that any call you get from someone claiming they know what is happening to your PC should be terminated rapidly.
But some people are getting repeated calls, and there must be quite a few who are worried enough to fall for the scam. My caller - who appeared by the way to be completely convinced that he was offering a legitimate product - told me that his firm had lots of satisfied customers.
The other question which I wanted answered was how the firm had got hold of my number - which I've listed with the Telephone Preference Service in order to avoid getting these calls.
The caller said it was on ""an international database"". If that is so, then someone is involved in a potentially illegal trade in personal data.
But as this company - like most of them - was based overseas they may not care too much about that. So it looks as though we can all expect to carry on getting these calls - and will have to choose to ignore them, or perhaps string them along for a while to waste their time.",Yes

488,77,computer virus,'Contagious' wi-fi virus created by Liverpool researchers,26 February 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26352439,"A computer virus that can spread via wi-fi like a ""common cold"" has been created by researchers in Liverpool.
In densely populated areas with lots of wi-fi networks, the virus can go from network to network finding weaknesses.
Once in control of a wi-fi access point, it leaves computers on the network extremely vulnerable.
The team's lead researcher told the BBC it was working on software to prevent such attacks being possible.
""Rather than rely on people to use strong passwords, you want to integrate intrusion detection systems to the access points,"" said Alan Marshall, professor of communication networks at the University of Liverpool.
He would not go into detail about the methods in order to prevent the attack being used on real victims but said a proof-of-concept attack had been developed at the university.
The virus, dubbed Chameleon, seeks out wi-fi access points - devices that transmit the wi-fi signal, found in many homes - that have not had their admin password changed.
This password is different from the one used to log on to the wi-fi network itself, and is often left unchanged from the default setting.
Once an access point is under a hacker's control, new firmware can be installed.
""So it's now under our control,"" explained Prof Marshall.
""Once you do that you can then do other things with it. You can recover passwords, steal data - anything you want.""
But it is the next step of the virus that is most unusual.
Once installed on one access point, the virus can - without being controlled by a human - automatically seek out other vulnerable access points, taking them over as and when they are found.
Prof Marshall told the BBC that this was unlikely to be a threat to big business wi-fi networks, which should have enhanced security in place.
However, networks in homes, or at small premises like coffee shops, are typically found with less stringent protection measures in place.
Now that his team has demonstrated the threat, Prof Marshall said attention would turn to creating a product that could be installed in wi-fi access points to prevent this kind of hijacking - without requiring the user to take responsibility.

The White House said June's NotPetya ransomware attack caused billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas.
UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was ""ripping up the rule book"" and the UK would respond.
Moscow denies being behind the attack, calling such claims ""Russophobic"".
Ransomware, which threatens to delete the target's files unless they pay a ransom, is regarded as the fastest growing form of computer virus.
Experts believe about 2,000 NotPetya attacks were launched, mainly aimed at Ukraine. The country Ukraine has been locked in a simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.
In the NotPetya attack, businesses with strong trade links with Ukraine, such as the UK's Reckitt Benckiser, Dutch delivery firm TNT and Danish shipping giant Maersk were affected. The attack is estimated to have cost companies more than $1.2bn (Â£850m).
Reckitt Benckiser - maker of Dettol, Durex and Strepsils - said the attack disrupted its manufacturing output and shipping capacity for up to two months.
On Thursday the UK government took the unusual step of publicly accusing the Russia military of being behind the attack.
""The UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,"" the foreign office said in a statement. Later, the White House also pointed the finger at Russia.
""In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,"" a statement said.
""This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber attack that will be met with international consequences.""
Russia, however, said the claims were ""groundless"" and that Russian businesses were among those whose systems were affected.
""It's not more than a continuation of the Russophobic campaign,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said: ""The UK government judges that the Russian government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber attack.""
""Its reckless release disrupted organisations across Europe costing hundreds of millions of pounds.
""We call upon Russia to be the responsible member of the international community it claims to be rather then secretly trying to undermine it.""
Mr Williamson warned that the West had ""entered a new era of warfare, witnessing a destructive and deadly mix of conventional military might and malicious cyber attacks"".

491,80,computer virus,Latvia resists US call to extradite 'virus maker',2 August 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23546186,"Latvia is resisting calls to extradite a man the US alleges wrote a computer virus used to steal millions.
In January, Latvian Deniss Calovskis was named by the US as one of the creators of the Gozi virus.
Latvian courts have twice rejected Mr Calovskis' appeal to prevent himself being extradited, but the country's foreign minister opposes the move.
He said the potential jail term Mr Calovskis faced was too severe for the crimes he is alleged to have committed.
The US began its campaign to extradite two of the three men alleged to have used Gozi soon after publicly accusing the trio of infecting more than one million computers with the virus and stealing data that was then used to plunder bank accounts.
They ran a ""modern-day bank robbery ring, that required neither a gun or a mask"", said US attorney Preet Bharara in January.
Romanian Mihai Ionut Paunescu and Russian national Nikita Kuzmin were named as the co-creators of Gozi. Mr Kuzmin is already in jail in the US following his arrest in May 2011 on separate hacking and fraud charges. Extradition proceedings against Mr Paunescu are currently on hold pending an appeal.
In a message posted to the website of Latvia's Foreign Ministry, minister Edgars Rinkevics said Latvian law guaranteed that people who broke the law suffered only ""proportionate punishment"".
Mr Rinkevics said the US sought a jail term for Mr Calovskis that exceeded 60 years.
While he could not take a view on whether Mr Calovskis broke the law or not, the jail term amounted to an effective life sentence, he wrote.
""In my view, such a penalty is disproportionate to the amount, and so far no-one has been able to conclusively dispel my fears that it might be otherwise,"" he said.
In addition, he said, there were questions over whether any of the crimes Mr Calovskis is alleged to have committed actually took place on US soil. The trans-national nature of much cyber crime would make it hard to prove his involvement, wrote Mr Rinkevics.
Finally, said the minister, if Mr Calovskis was found guilty there was no reason why he could not serve a sentence for his crimes in his native Latvia.
Security analyst Graham Cluley said Gozi was a very successful trojan that pilfered huge sums from bank accounts.
""If you caught a criminal who stole sums like that in traditional bank robberies, you would expect them to have the book thrown at them and wouldn't be surprised if they ended up with a serious criminal sentence,"" he said.
""It's important to see more co-operation internationally to bring internet criminals to justice, and a consistency in the treatment and sentencing of convicted hackers,"" he added.
""It's necessary when investigations cross national boundaries that proper legal processes are followed, which can mean it takes a lot of time and effort to get a result,"" said Mr Cluley.",Yes
492,81,computer virus,NHS told to ditch 'absurd' fax machines,9 December 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46497526,"The NHS will be banned from buying fax machines from next month - and has been told by the government to phase out the machines entirely by 31 March 2020.
In July, the Royal College of Surgeons revealed nearly 9,000 fax machines were in use across the NHS in England.
The Department of Health said a change to more modern communication methods was needed to improve patient safety and cyber security.
An RCS spokesman said they supported the government's decision.
In place of fax machines, the Department of Health said secure email should be used.
Richard Kerr, who is the chair of the RCS's commission on the future of surgery, said the continued use of the outdated technology by the NHS was ""absurd"".
He added it was ""crucial"" that the health service invested in ""better ways of communicating the vast amount of patient information that is going to be generated"" in the future.
The group's report from earlier this year found the use of fax machines was most common at the Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust, which still relied on 603 machines.
Three-quarters of the trusts in England replied to the survey - 95 in total. Ten trusts said that they did not own any fax machines, but four in ten reported more than 100 in use.
Rebecca McIntyre from Manchester, who works as a cognitive behavioural therapist, said fax machines are ""a continued risk to the confidentiality and safeguarding of patients"".
""You would not believe the palaver we have in the work place trying to communicate important documents to services (referrals etc),"" she said.
""We constantly receive faxes meant for other places in error but this is never reported.""
Meanwhile, Taz, from Doncaster, works in a pharmacy and said discharge notes, emergency documents and out-of-hours services ""all are stuck in the dark ages"".
""I hope this is just the start of many changes,"" he said. ""The amount of time wasted and potential errors that exist from not using technology is shocking and often it's the patients that suffer.
""My next hope is that hand written prescriptions are scrapped completely and we use tablets to send them electronically for patients like most GPs have been doing for years.""
However, Tim Owen. from Bolton, who works in blood services, asked: ""So what happens when a computer virus attacks a hospital's IT infrastructure, as happened recently?

493,82,computer virus,Lois Lane actress Margot Kidder dies aged 69,14 May 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44115166,"Actress Margot Kidder, best known for her role as Lois Lane in Superman, has died aged 69.
A funeral home in Livingston, Montana, where the actress lived, said Kidder died at her home on Sunday.
She rose to fame starring alongside Christopher Reeve in the Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s.
The Canadian-born actress acquired American citizenship in 2005, and became a political and women's rights activist alongside her acting.
The cause of her death is not yet known.
Kidder starred alongside Reeve in the 1978 film Superman and its sequels, as well as horror classics Black Christmas and The Amityville Horror.
The actress was also an outspoken critic of the Gulf War, of fracking by energy companies, and was at times a vocal supporter of Democratic party candidates.
After settling in the US state of Montana, she became a supporter of Montana Women For, a non-profit organisation which describes its goals as the ""participation and empowerment of women in our democracy through education and advocacy on critical issues"".
As an activist, she was arrested in 2011 while taking part in a protest at the White House against the Keystone XL pipeline, which remains controversial today.
Kidder also suffered from mental health problems, which resulted in her high-profile disappearance for several days in 1996.
In an interview with People magazine later that year, she referred to her disappearance as ""the most public freak-out in history"".
While working on her memoirs, a computer virus destroyed all of her work, she told the magazine - something she concluded was deliberate, and involved her former husband and the CIA.
She was eventually found safe, and would talk openly about her experience of manic episodes and of depression in the years ahead, raising awareness about bipolar disorder while advocating the use of alternative medicine as a treatment.
On social media, film and superhero fans paid tribute to the actress. DC Comics, publisher of the Superman comic books, said Kidder was ""the Lois Lane so many of us grew up with"".
Eric Goldman, editor at rival comic book maker Marvel, said Kidder ""made sure my generation knew just how awesome Lois Lane was"" - a sentiment echoed by famed comic book writer Mark Millar, who said she was ""my Lois Lane"".
Teri Hatcher, who played Lois Lane in the 1990s TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, wrote that it had been ""a privilege"" to step into Kidder's role - while her co-star Dean Cain also tweeted his condolences.
English actress Sarah Douglas - who played supervillain Ursa, famously sucker-punched by the plucky Lane - tweeted that Kidder had been ""a joy to be around"".
Some fans recalled the landmark cinematic moments from the original 1978 Superman film, while others applauded the actress' open discussion of mental health issues at a time when it was unpopular to make such things public.
Actor Cameron Cuffe, currently starring in Superman spin-off TV series Krypton, wrote: ""On screen there are few who have brought a legend to life in the same way Margot Kidder did. As a person there are few who have been as honest and brave when it came to being open about mental health.""
""A pioneer and inspiration always.""
Kidder married and divorced three times. She is survived by her only child, Maggie, and two grandchildren.",Yes

It quoted unnamed ""Western officials with knowledge of the effort""  
          
 
          as its sources
.
The powerful malware was discovered after the UN noticed data disappearing from PCs in the Middle East.
The Post said the US National Security Agency, the CIA and Israel's military had collaborated on the project.
It had ""intended to slow Iran's nuclear program, reduce the pressure for a conventional military attack and extend the timetable for diplomacy and sanctions"", the newspaper said.
Reuters subsequently reported  
          
 
          that current and former Western national security officials
 had told the news agency the US had been involved in making the virus.
The BBC has been unable to confirm or disprove the allegations.
Flame is thought to have been first noticed when Iran's servers were taken offline in April following a malware attack on key oil terminals.
A later report by anti-virus company Kaspersky Labs said there had been 189 attacks in Iran, 98 in Israel and Palestine, and 32 in Sudan.
A ""former high-ranking US intelligence official"", who it said had spoken on the condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post: ""[Flame] is about preparing the battlefield for another type of covert action.
""Cyber-collection against the Iranian programme is way further down the road than this.""
Iran has said it is now able to defend itself against the malware and clean up infected PCs .
But the attacks could lead the country to develop its own sophisticated cyber-capabilities, Mark Phillips, a research fellow at defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told BBC News.
""If it did originate from the US and/or Israel, Iran is going to feel under siege as a result of a number of attempts - a previous one was Stuxnet - and will seek to improve its cyber-defences,"" he said.
""The better you are at detecting cyber-actions, the better you are at infiltrating others.
""This cyber-onslaught that Iran has been facing from Stuxnet through to Flame is actually helping it to become a really serious cyber-power in its own right, which would not have been an intended effect of whoever developed Flame.""
Security experts call Flame one of the most complex threats ever seen, suggesting a nation state rather than individual hackers are likely to have been behind its development.
""The reason [sources] may want to stay anonymous is because of the sensitive nature of technologies and capabilities involved,"" said Mr Phillips.
""We're probably stuck with a situation where we'll only have this speculation for a foreseeable future.""

A recent Office of National Statistics survey suggested there are 5.4 million fraud and computer misuse cases a year.
Other findings include:
Which said that it could not explain why certain frauds occur more in some areas rather than others, partly because so many fraud cases go unreported so the data is incomplete.
There were 264,204 frauds reported to Action Fraud in 2016 but this is likely to be a fraction of those that occur.
Which's report did suggest that certain demographics are targeted by different scams  - so, for example, fake computer fixes tend to focus on elderly women living in rural areas.
Members of the public can click on an interactive map to find out the most commonly occurring fraud in their county.
Gareth Shaw, Which? money expert, thinks there is little doubt that online fraud is on the rise: ""This research highlights how reported fraud in the UK is on the increase and the kinds of scams you are most likely to fall victim to will depend on where you live.
""These criminals are constantly finding new ways to rip us off and those tackling fraud should be upping their game. The government needs to set out an ambitious agenda to tackle fraud, while law enforcement agencies need to be working harder to identify and protect the people most at risk from fraud.""

The malicious software - dubbed Stars - was capable of inflicting minor damage, according to the head of Iran's civil defence organisation.
If the reports are accurate, it would be the second major attack in a year.
The recently discovered Stuxnet worm is thought to have been created to take control of equipment used in Iran's nuclear programme.
It would take some time to establish Stars' intended purpose, said Gholam Reza Jalali, military head of the Iranian Passive Defence Organisation.
""The Stars virus has been presented to the laboratory but is still being investigated,"" he said.
""No definite final conclusions have been reached.""
Mr Jalali revealed that the virus could have been ""mistaken for executive files of governmental organisations"", but gave no indication about who might be behind the attack.
Last week, the same official suggested that Stuxnet was the work of the United States and warned that it could have caused large-scale accidents and loss of life.
Stuxnet first came to light in July 2010.  Analysis by security firm Symantec showed that, while it could be transmitted via the internet, it was designed to infect specific types of industrial controllers.
The machinery in question was used to control centrifuges at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
Most experts who have looked at the case agree, given the scale and complexity of Stuxnet, that a foreign state was probably behind its development.

Deniss Calovskis admitted in a New York court hearing that he had been hired to write part of the Gozi computer virus.
The code Calovskis wrote changed banking websites and helped make the virus more effective.
Gozi was first found in 2007 but remained active for years and is thought to have infected more than one million computers worldwide.
""I knew what I was doing was against the law,"" Calovskis said in court, answering charges of conspiring to commit computer intrusion.
Calovskis was extradited to the US from Latvia in February after lengthy negotiations between the two nations over the potential sentence he would serve.
Latvian government officials initially resisted calls to hand over Calovskis, saying US plans to sentence him to more than 60 years in jail did not represent ""proportionate punishment"".
A plea agreement on sentencing reached with lawyers representing Calovskis means he will not appeal against any jail sentence of two years or less.
It is not clear whether the 10 months Calovskis spent in jail in Latvia during the extradition row will count as part of the sentence he eventually receives.
He is scheduled to be sentenced on 14 December.
Two other men have been arrested in connection with the creation and administration of Gozi.

The 23-year-old is believed to have written the program behind the mariposa virus, also known as butterfly.
The botnet, one of the world's largest, was dismantled earlier this year after infecting 12.7 million computers.
It was designed to steal personal financial details and was also found in the PCs of banks and major companies. Officials from around the world have been chasing the cyber criminals.
In December 2009, three people believed to have been running it were arrested in Spain.
""To use an analogy here, as opposed to arresting the guy who broke into your home, we've arrested the guy that gave him the crowbar, the map and the best houses in the neighbourhood,"" Jeffrey Troy, deputy assistant director for the FBI cyber division told Associated Press.
Botnets are networks of computers with malicious software installed. This puts them under the control of cyber criminals without the knowledge of individual owners.
They can send spam e-mail from the host's machine or search for information such as credit card details and send them back to their creator. They also send replica programmes to other computers, sometimes via the e-mail of the host.
Security expert Rik Ferguson told the BBC that the mariposa botnet had got out of control.
""They guys behind it said it was more successful than they had intended to be,"" he said.
""As is the case with most botnets, the more widespread they are the more likely they are to be discovered. They were a victim of their own success.""
Mr Ferguson, senior security adviser at Trend Micro, added that while it was not unusual for a botnet to infect hundreds of thousands of computers, one infecting several million was rare.
Nobody has yet been arrested in connection with the Conficker worm, a similar virus which is currently running on 6 million Windows PCs and is believed to peaked at up to 12 million, he said.
While the core group behind a particular botnet is generally quite small, there is a whole industry of people offering ""cyber crime services"" such as tool kit building and program writing, he added.
""The thing with the underground economy is that it's full of niche vendors and players, it mirrors legitimate business. There's a lot of competition - it's not unusual to see malware designed to remove other malware, just so that it can take over.""",Yes

Nasa has confirmed that laptops carried to the ISS in July were infected with a virus known as Gammima.AG.
The worm was first detected on Earth in August 2007 and lurks on infected machines waiting to steal login names for popular online games.
Nasa said it was not the first time computer viruses had travelled into space and it was investigating how the machines were infected.
Orbital outbreak
Space news website SpaceRef broke the story about the virus on the laptops that astronauts took to the ISS.
Nasa told SpaceRef that no command or control systems of the ISS were at risk from the malicious program.
The laptops infected with the virus were used to run nutritional programs and let the astronauts periodically send e-mail back to Earth.
The laptops carried by astronauts reportedly do not have any anti-virus software on them to prevent infection.
Once it has scooped up passwords and login names the Gammima.AG worm virus tries to send them back to a central server. It targets a total of 10 games most of which are popular in the Far East such as Maple Story, HuangYi Online and Talesweaver.
Nasa is working with partners on the ISS to find out how the virus got on to the laptop in the first place.
The ISS has no direct net connection and all data traffic travelling from the ground to the spacecraft is scanned before being transmitted.
It is thought that the virus might have travelled via a flash or USB drive owned by an astronaut and taken into space.
The space agency also plans to put in place security systems to stop such incidents happening in the future.

510,99,computer virus,Three US hospitals hit by ransomware,23 March 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35880610,"The IT systems of three US hospitals have been infected with ransomware, which encrypts vital files and demands money to unlock them.
The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again.
None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom.
And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI.
The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system.
A message on its homepage said: ""Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services.
""We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications.""
It later said no patient data or care had been affected.
Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: ""It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems.
""However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online.""
The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware.
In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back.
Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky.
The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros ""if the data encoding is incorrect"".
Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked.
In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016.
Security expert Brian Krebs said: ""It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted.

511,100,computer virus,A quarter century of computer viruses,20 July 2007,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6906414.stm,"Until recently virus writers were keen to be noticed




The Apple II computer was a pioneer in many ways - some of which its inventors intended and some they most certainly did not.

In 1982, the machine had the dubious distinction of being used to create and distribute the first virus for a personal computer.

Called Elk Cloner, the virus was created by the then 15-year-old Rich Skrenta as a prank to catch out his friends.

Prior to its appearance, virus-like programs had been seen on other machines and networks, said computer security veteran David Perry from anti-virus firm Trend Micro.

In the 1970s a benign worm called Creeper circulated on Arpanet - the forerunner of what became the internet - by using free computer cycles on various nodes of the network.

But, said Mr Perry, most of the other malicious programs before 1982 existed only in laboratories.

In fact, he said, the term ""virus"" got one of its first uses in an academic paper written by Fred Cohen about some destructive programs he had created while doing a computer science course.
Trend setter

Elk Cloner is widely seen as being the first to spread ""in the wild"" which means it managed to escape the confines of the computer it was created on to infect many other machines.

Very few of the personal computers in use in 1984 were networked but Elk Cloner managed to travel via the ""sneaker net"" when Apple II users took a floppy disk it was lurking on, walked across the room or campus and put it into a clean machine.






The first virus hit the Apple II machine





""Most people infected with Elk Cloner infected themselves just to see what it did,"" said Mr Perry.

Viruses for IBM PCs followed in 1986 and many of those followed the path set by Elk Cloner in that they were created by teenagers; were nothing but a nuisance; travelled by floppy disk and were written to reflect glory on hobbyist hackers.

For years afterwards, said Mr Perry, all the viruses for the PC conformed to these basic characteristics. 

The viruses were easy to spot, rarely did any damage and as a result outbreaks were few and far between and, as a result, anti-virus companies only updated their security products every six months or so.

Greg Day, security analyst at McAfee, who started out doing customer support for the Dr Solomon anti-virus company, said: ""Four of us were doing technical support and if the telephone rang we would argue about who was going to answer it.""

""Often we'd say 'I've done two today; it's your turn',"" he said.
 
Every big outbreak was a story, said Mr Day, and he remembers 1991 when TV crews camped outside the doors of the Dr Solomon office in the days leading up to 6 March when the Michelangelo virus was due to strike.

This virus was scheduled to activate on the anniversary of the birth of the sculptor and overwrite hard drives with nonsense. 
Virus deluge

The situation in 2007, he said, could not be more different. 






Now most viruses are aimed at Windows machines





Now, said Mr Day, anti-virus updates were done on a daily basis, sometimes more, and the majority of people employed by anti-virus companies are in customer support helping people cope with the relentless wave of malicious programs hitting their networks and inboxes.
 
Instead of one company getting hit every few months, many get caught out every single day, he said. 

It took the numbers of viruses about 20 years to hit the 100,000 mark, said Mr Day, but in the last three years that number has ballooned to more than 250,000.

""It's so high no one counts any more,"" he said.
 
What has made the difference, say both Mr Perry and Mr Day, is cash. Hi-tech criminals have cottoned on to the fact that viruses and malicious programs are an easy way to getting hold of lucrative information, be it login names and passwords or credit card numbers.

The ""giant criminal conspiracies making malware"" have steamrollered the teenage wannabes out of the way, said Mr Perry, and now dominate the online hi-tech crime scene.

By contrast to the teenagers virus writers, he said, the cyber criminals do not want their malicious creations noticed. 

Far better that they lurk unseen for a long time mining information or using a PC as a platform to relay spam or launch attacks on websites.

As well as viruses travelling via e-mail, there are spyware programs that watch what people do and adware programs that bombard people with pop-up adverts they never asked to see. Even benign-looking applications such as screensavers can be booby-trapped with a malicious program.

And, said Mr Perry, it was unlikely to get any safer for a long time to come.

""The more items we turn over to computers the higher the temptation will be for people to mess with it,"" he said. ""There's going to be a time when you need a firewall or anti-virus for your car.""

The American-Israeli company's researchers documented 1,200 victims being targeted by the campaign, living in seven countries.
There had been more than 600 successful infections, it said.
The second group, known as Infy or Prince Of Persia, is said to spy on the home and work PCs of dissidents in 12 countries, extracting sensitive data after tricking people into opening malicious email attachments.
The Iranian government has not commented on the report.
Domestic Kitten's operation was first identified in 2018.
And Check Point said there was evidence it had run at least 10 campaigns since 2017.
Four of these were still active, with the most recent beginning in November 2020.
And it was using an Iranian blog site, Telegram channels and text messages to lure people into installing its infected software, which the researchers have dubbed Furball, which could:
The 600 successful infections are said to have included dissidents, opposition forces and people belonging to the Kurdish ethnic minority in:
The other group, Infy, is said to have been operating as far back as 2007.
Its most recent activity had targeted PCs, with fake emails with attractive content, usually with an attached document, Check Point said.
One example provided was of a document apparently about loans being offered to disabled veterans.
Once the document was opened, a spying tool was installed and sensitive data stolen, the company said.
Two documents recently used are said to have included a photo of an Iranian governor, with alleged contact details.
The researchers said Infy's capabilities were ""far superior"" to most other known Iranian campaigns, thanks to its ability to be highly selective about its targets and to have generally have gone undetected.
""It is clear that the Iranian government is investing significant resources into cyber-operations,"" Check Point cyber-research head Yaniv Balmas said.
""The operators of these Iranian cyber-espionage campaigns seem to be completely unaffected by any counter-activities done by others, even though both campaigns had been revealed and even stopped in the past.

513,2,spyware,Al Jazeera journalists âhacked via NSO Group spywareâ,21 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55396843,"Dozens of Al Jazeera journalists were allegedly hacked with the help of spyware developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, cyber-security researchers say.
Details of the alleged hack targeting 36 members of staff, including TV anchors and executives, have been published in a report by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.
It says a vulnerability in iPhone operating system software was used.
NSO Group has denied the allegation, saying it âlacks any evidence"".
Citizen Lab researchers say they concluded with âmedium confidenceâ that two attackers who had spied on the phones of Al Jazeera journalists were doing so on behalf of the Saudi Arabian and UAE governments.
âThe phones were compromised using an exploit chain that we call Kismet,â the researchers write.
In July 2020, Kismet was a ""zero-day"" attack - meaning Apple was supposedly unaware of the flaw - and it worked on at least iOS 13.5.1, and could hack Appleâs iPhone 11, the latest model at the time.
Citizen Lab was first alerted to potential spying activity on the journalistsâ phones when contacted by Tamer Almisshal, an investigative filmmaker at Al Jazeera.
Mr Almisshal had expressed concerns that his iPhone had been hacked and so allowed Citizen Lab to monitor activity on the device.
âWe noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an Installation Server for NSO Groupâs Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,â the Citizen Lab researchers allege in their report.
Hitting back at the allegations, a spokesman for NSO Group said: âThis memo is based once again on speculation and lacks any evidence supporting a connection to NSO.â
He added that the firm provided software to governments, who used it tackle serious organised crime and terrorism, and did not operate the software itself.
NSO Group would continue âto work tirelessly to make the world a safer placeâ, he added.
The exploit described by the Citizen Lab team fails to work on iPhones running iOS 14, the latest version.
Users should update to this version immediately, the researchers said.
A spokesman for Apple added that iOS 14 was âa major leap forwardâ in protecting against such attacks.
âThe attack described in the research was highly targeted by nation states against specific individuals,â he said.
âWe always urge customers to download the latest version of the software to protect themselves and their data.â

514,3,spyware,Flubot: Warning over major Android 'package delivery' scam,23 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56859091,"A text-message scam that infects Android phones is spreading across the UK, experts have warned.
The message - which pretends to be from a package delivery firm, prompts users to install a tracking app - but is actually a malicious piece of spyware.
Called Flubot, it can take over devices and spy on phones to gather sensitive data, including online banking details.
Network operator Vodafone said millions of the text messages were already being sent, across all networks.
""We believe this current wave of Flubot malware SMS attacks will gain serious traction very quickly, and it's something that needs awareness to stop the spread,"" a spokesman said.
Customers should ""be especially vigilant with this particular piece of malware"", he said, and be very careful about clicking on any links in a text message.
Other networks, including EE and Three, followed with warnings of their own.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) later issued guidance about the threat, including advice on what to do if you have already downloaded the attacker's application by mistake.
""If users have clicked a malicious link it's important not to panic - there are actionable steps they can take to protect their devices and their accounts,"" the NCSC said in a statement.
The malware also has the ability to send more text messages to an infected user's contacts, helping it spread.
""The seriousness of these malicious text messages is underlined by Vodafone making the decision to alert its customers,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.
""This has the potential to become a denial-of-service attack on mobile networks, given the clear risk that a rogue application can be installed on users' smartphones and start spewing out endless text messages.
""The broader risk for users is a loss of highly sensitive personal data from their phones,"" he added.
While text message scams claiming to be about a package delivery firm are common, they have mostly focused on phishing - trying to trick the user into filling in a form with bank details and other information.
This newest wave differs because it tries to install malicious software on the phone itself - and because of the scale of its spread.
One version of the scam reported online pretends to be a text message from DHL, with a link to a website for parcel tracking.
If someone using an Android phone clicks on the link, they will be taken to a page ""explaining"" how to install the parcel tracking app using something called an APK.
APK files are a way of installing Android apps outside of the secure Google Play store. By default, such applications will be blocked for security reasons, but the scam page includes instructions on how to allow the installation.
That can be confusing, as there are some niche genuine cases for installing those kind of apps - such as downloading the Fortnite video game, which was removed from the official app store amid a major legal row between its owner and Google.
Apple iPhone users are not affected as those phones cannot install Android APKs.
In a blog post detailing the scam, security researcher Paul Morrison wrote that he expects the ""success rate would be low"" due to the hurdles involved.
But he said: ""With the number of SMS being sent out, just a 0.1% success rate could be very profitable.""
The Flubot malware has also spread in other countries in recent months - notably Spain, Germany and Poland.
Kate Bevan, computing editor at consumer magazine Which? said people have to be ""wary"" of texts.
""If you're not sure, contact the delivery company's official customer service helpline,"" she said.
""As ever, it's important to make sure that your mobile phone is up to date with security patches. Consider also installing mobile security software from a trusted brand.""
Industry body Mobile UK said users who receive a suspicious message should forward it to 7726 to report it, a spokesman said - and then delete the message.",Yes
515,4,spyware,NSO Group: Israeli firm 'impersonated Facebook to spread spyware',21 May 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52758784,"Israeli security company NSO Group impersonated Facebook as part of a ploy to get users to install its phone-hacking software, a new report alleges.
An investigation from news site Motherboard claims a Facebook security lookalike domain was set up to spread NSO's Pegasus hacking tool.
It also claimed to have found evidence that servers inside the United States were used to spread the spying tool.
NSO denies the allegations, labelling them ""recycled conjecture"".
The Pegasus spyware, once installed, can read text messages and other data on the phone, track its location with GPS, and access the microphone and camera.
The Israeli firm is already locked in a legal battle with Facebook, which alleges it deliberately spread its software over WhatsApp, compromising hundreds of phones - including those of journalists and human rights activists. It is also, separately, accused of supplying software to the Saudi government which was allegedly used to spy on journalist Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed.
Facebook's complaint alleged NSO operated the spyware itself. But NSO has asked the court in California to dismiss the case, in part because it says it never uses its spyware - only sovereign governments do.
Motherboard's latest investigation revolves around a former NSO employee who, it is claimed, provided it with details of a server allegedly designed to distribute the spyware by tricking people into clicking links.
The server investigated was connected to several different web addresses over a number of years - including one that impersonated Facebook's security team, the Motherboard report claims.
Facebook told the BBC it had gained ownership of the domain in question four years ago, to stop it being misused.
Other domains used over time included ""a link a person could click on to unsubscribe themselves from emails or text messages... and package tracking links from FedEx,"" Motherboard reports.
But NSO fiercely denies that it has ever used its products itself.
""We are incredibly proud of our technology's role in tackling crime and terrorism, but NSO does not operate any of its products,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""As we have repeatedly made clear, NSO products are offered to and operated solely by verified and authorised government agencies.""
Motherboard also alleged that one of the servers used to launch the malware was located within the United States - something that NSO says is not possible. Facebook has previously made similar allegations in the WhatsApp legal case.
""We stand by our previous statements that NSO Group products cannot be used to conduct cyber-surveillance within the United States, and no customer has ever been granted technology that enables targeting phones with US numbers,"" a spokesman said.
Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said the possibility of US-based servers being used to deploy the spyware raised ""more questions than answers"".
""They appear to have some sort of infrastructure in the US,"" Prof Woodward said. ""The question is whether the US government is aware of it.""
A Facebook spokesperson said: ""NSO Group is responsible for cyber-attacks against human rights activists, journalists, and diplomats, in violation of US law.
""We are committed to protecting the security of our community and are seeking to hold them accountable in court.""
NSO said its official stance remained that which it had put forward in the legal case with Facebook.
""Revisiting and recycling the conjecture of NSO's detractors... doesn't change the overall truth of our position, which we have stated to the US Federal Court in California,"" it said.
""Factual assertions on all the above have been provided as part of the official court record, and we do not have anything else to add at this time.""",Yes
516,5,spyware,Coronavirus: Israeli spyware firm pitches to be Covid-19 saviour,2 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52134452,"A controversial Israeli cyber-security company is marketing software that uses mobile phone data to monitor and predict the spread of the coronavirus.
NSO Group says it is in talks with governments around the world, and claims some are already testing it.
The surveillance software-maker is being sued by WhatsApp for allegedly sending malware to the phones of human rights activists and journalists.
It has denied that allegation ""in the strongest possible terms"".
The company also faces a lawsuit in which it is accused of supplying software to the Saudi government, which the country is said to have used to spy on the journalist Jamal Khashoggi before his murder.
Last year, NSO responded to that claim by saying that its products were ""licensed for the sole use of providing governments and law enforcement agencies the ability to lawfully fight terrorism and crime"".
But now, it is pitching its tools as a means to help better understand how coronavirus is spreading.
""The software is here to solve a global pandemic,"" a spokesman told the BBC.
""This is about giving governments the ability to understand the situation they're facing and make informed decisions. It's a really powerful piece of software.""
NSO says its employees will not have access to any data, but its software will work best if a government asks local mobile phone operators to provide the records of every subscriber in the country.
Each person known to be infected with Covid-19 could then be tracked, with the people they had met and the places they had visited, even before showing symptoms, plotted on a map.
But John Scott Railton, of the Toronto-based privacy watchdog Citizen Lab, said governments would be foolish to use the system.
""The last thing that we need is a secretive company claiming to solve a pandemic while refusing to say who its clients are,"" he said.
NSO gave the BBC a demonstration of how its system works, via a video conference link.
A heat map of Israel showed hotspots where there were a high number of cases of the virus.
Zooming in, individual phones of people with the infection were mapped, and represented by an anonymised ID number. Details were also shown of other phones they had encountered and the relevant times and locations.
The engineer demonstrating the system said that it could be used to:
NSO said a number of governments around the world were piloting the system, but would not reveal their identity or whether any of them had started using it in the field.
A spokesman added that the firm had made it a requirement that the authorities involved were operating in compliance with Europe's GDPR privacy law or their own data protection rules.
Software requiring mobile networks to hand over customer data represents a very different approach from the contact-tracing apps being considered in the UK and many other European countries.
Such apps, would use a phone's Bluetooth connection to alert users if they had been in contact with someone infected with the virus, and would almost certainly be voluntary to download.
Citizen Lab previously investigated NSO's Pegasus software. It found evidence that it had been secretly installed on the phones of journalists and dissidents in countries from Mexico to the Middle East.
""NSO has shown that it is uniquely capable of damaging public trust,"" said Mr Railton.
""I can't think of a better brand name to make citizens nervous about a governmental tracking effort.""
There has been controversy in Israel over a separate project which could see its defence ministry work with NSO Group to assess the likelihood that individual citizens might spread the coronavirus.
Defence minister Naftali Bennet proposed giving NSO access to highly sensitive data about citizens collected by the Shin Bet security services. But Israeli lawmakers attacked the plan, warning that handing data to a private company raised serious concerns.",Yes
517,6,spyware,WhatsApp: Indians among those 'targeted' by spyware,31 October 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-50245209,"Messaging app WhatsApp has said Indian journalists and activists are among some 1,400 people worldwide who were targeted with Israeli-made spyware.
WhatsApp filed a lawsuit against NSO Group on Wednesday, alleging it was behind cyber-attacks that infected devices in April and May.
The Israeli company, which makes software for surveillance, has strongly disputed the allegations.
India has 400 million WhatsApp users, making the country its biggest market.
Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices by using a major vulnerability in the messaging app.
""We believe this attack targeted at least 100 members of civil society, which is an unmistakable pattern of abuse,"" WhatsApp said in a statement.
After discovering the cyber-attacks in May, WhatsApp quickly rolled out a fix, adding ""new protections"" to their systems and issuing updates.
Cyber experts at Toronto-based internet watchdog Citizen Lab helped WhatsApp identify cases where the suspected targets of this attack were members of civil society, such as human rights defenders or journalists.
Citizen Lab said it had identified more than 100 cases of ""abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe, ranging from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America"".
""Indian journalists and human rights activists have been the target of surveillance and while I cannot reveal their identities and the exact number, I can say that it is not an insignificant number,"" WhatsApp spokesperson Carl Woog told The Indian Express newspaper.
Mr Woog said the service had contacted each of the people targeted and informed them about the cyber attack.
WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are encrypted end-to-end. This means they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device.
The firm, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014, said this was the first time an encrypted messaging provider had taken legal action of this kind.
Israel's NSO Group said it would fight the allegations.
""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,"" the company said in a statement to the BBC.
""The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.""",Yes

Unnamed US national security officials, quoted by Bloomberg, said microchips were found in gadgets used by US government agencies.
Lenovo's shares fell more than 15%, while ZTE lost more than 10%.
Lenovo said it did not source parts from Super Micro, the firm at the centre of the allegations.
ZTE has declined to comment.
According to the report, Super Micro is said to have supplied servers that allegedly contained the malicious hardware.
Tiny chips on its server circuit boards had been used to siphon off data, the news agency said.
Super Micro has rejected Bloomberg's claims, calling them ""untrue"".
Apple and Amazon have also denied that their computer systems were among those reportedly containing the devices.
ZTE is one of China's leading state-owned companies and has long laboured under suspicions that the use of its equipment and services poses a security threat to Western nations.
In July, Washington lifted an order that blocked ZTE from doing business with US companies.

519,8,spyware,Data-stealing spyware 'traced to Lebanon',19 January 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42746772,"A security bug that has infected thousands of smartphones has been uncovered by campaign group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).
Working with mobile security firm Lookout, researchers discovered that malware in fake messaging designed to look like WhatsApp and Signal had stolen gigabytes of data.
Targets included military personnel, activists, journalists and lawyers.
Researchers say they traced the malware to a Lebanese government building.
The threat, dubbed Dark Caracal by the researchers, looks as if it could come from a nation state and appears to use shared infrastructure linked to other nation-state hackers, the report said.
The malware takes advantage of known exploits and targets mainly Android phones.
Data was traced back to a server in a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut, according to researchers.
""Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the GDGS is associated with or directly supporting the actors behind Dark Caracal,"" the report said.
""People in the US, Canada, Germany, Lebanon, and France have been hit by Dark Caracal. Targets include military personnel, activists, journalists, and lawyers, and the types of stolen data range from call records and audio recordings to documents and photos,"" said EFF director of cybersecurity Eva Galperin.
""This is a very large, global campaign, focused on mobile devices. Mobile is the future of spying, because phones are full of so much data about a person's day-to-day life.""
Mike Murray, vice-president of security intelligence at Lookout said: ""Dark Caracal is part of a trend we've seen mounting over the past year whereby traditional advanced persistent threat actors are moving toward using mobile as a primary target platform.""
In a statement published on the Lookout blog, Google said it was confident that the infected apps were not downloaded from its Play Store.
""Google has identified the apps associated with this actor, none of the apps were on the Google Play Store. Google Play Protect has been updated to protect user devices from these apps and is in the process of removing them from all affected devices.""
The researchers believe Dark Caracal has been operating since 2012 but it has been hard to track because of the diversity of seemingly unrelated espionage campaigns originating from the same domain names.
Over the years Dark Caracal's work has been repeatedly misattributed to other cybercrime groups, the researchers said.
In November, Afghanistan moved to ban WhatsApp and Telegram as a way to stop insurgent groups from using encrypted messaging. And in December, Iran moved to restrict use of the apps after a series of anti-establishment protests.
Use of an app that can steal data would give nation states much more information than simply banning them, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.
""It is always hard to prove that a nation state is involved. During the Cold War, countries made use of mercenaries and that's what we are seeing online now.""
He said it was unclear where the infected apps had been downloaded from.
""Google is saying that they were not downloaded from there but it is difficult to know where else they came from. It may be that people are getting suckered into something that looks like an official site. People need to be careful what they are downloading.""",Yes

The software was reportedly stolen from a security firm called NSO Group, known for creating surveillance software.
The former NSO developer is believed to have stolen the code after learning he was going to be sacked.
Israel's Justice Ministry said if the sale had gone ahead it could have harmed state security.
In a statement, the ministry said the accused was a senior programmer at NSO who had access to the firm's development systems including its stores of source code.
The ministry said once the programmer had downloaded company code, he posed as a hacker and sought to sell the software on dark web markets.
It is claimed that he asked for a payment of $50m to be made in crypto-cash to make it harder to trace.
The unidentified individual who agreed to buy the software contacted NSO before the deal went ahead. A sting was set up and the suspected thief was arrested.
Daily newspaper Israel Hayom reported that the indictment against the former NSO employee said: ""The defendant's âactions seriously jeopardised the NSO Group and âcould have led to its collapse.""

An internet watchdog based in Canada, Citizen Lab, said the surveillance software is only sold to governments.
Last week, Citizen Lab also said that 12 journalists and human rights lawyers had been targeted.
At the time, the Mexican President, Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, described accusations that the government was involved as false.
Mr PeÃ±a Nieto said surveillance software was only used for matters of national security and for fighting organised crime.
He added that he had ordered an investigation by the attorney general's office.
Citizen Lab said the head of the Conservative National Action Party (PAN), Ricardo Anaya, a PAN Senator, Roberto Gil Zuarth, and the party's communications secretary, Fernando Rodriguez, were targeted.
""There is strong circumstantial evidence implicating the government of Mexico"", the watchdog said.

The Israeli-made spyware was only sold to governments, according to Citizen Lab, which is based in Canada.
Mexican journalists, human rights activists and opposition politicians have made similar allegations.
Mexico's government denies using the spyware to snoop on its opponents.
It says it has only used intelligence tools in the interest of national security or to fight organised crime.
The students, from an all-male college in the southern town of Ayotzinapa, were declared dead after disappearing in 2014 in the south-western state of Guerrero.
Their relatives have accused the authorities of a cover-up. Some Mexicans have held out hope that members of the group may yet be found alive.
The foreign experts, convened by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, were called in to investigate the disappearance of the students.
The team has repeatedly accused the Mexican government of blocking their work.
Citizen Lab, which is based at the University of Toronto, says in its analysis that it has found forensic evidence to show that the investigators' mobile phones were being targeted by Israeli-made spyware.
One member, Spanish investigator Carlos Beristain, said the attempt to install spyware could be a ""more serious crime given the diplomatic protected status"" the group held.
Attempts to infect their devices reportedly took place in March 2016, shortly after the group accused the Mexican government of hampering its inquiry, and as they were preparing a final report.
The software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by the Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists.
It is usually sent in a text message to a smartphone.
If the person taps on it, the spyware is installed, and huge amounts of private data - including text messages, photos, emails, location data, the device's microphone and camera - are hacked.
One message sent to investigators in March was from someone pretending to pass on personal information about a funeral. ""Here are the details. I hope you can come,"" it read.
According to the New York Times, the same link was sent last year to an academic trying to impose a sugar tax in Mexico and, in that case, the message was confirmed as a Pegasus trick.
Mr Beristain said he had received the message but had not opened it as he suspected some form of espionage.
On the evening of 26 September 2014, a group of 43 Mexican students disappeared in Guerrero.
They had been studying at an all-male teacher training college that has a history of left-wing activism.
Before they disappeared, the students reportedly clashed with municipal police while on their way to a protest. Police opened fire on their buses.
According to the official government report, the group was then handed over by corrupt officers to members of a local drugs gang.
The government version of events says their bodies were burnt in a fire at a rubbish dump. Authorities identified one student, Alexander Mora, from charred bone they said they had found at the site, and they partially identified another.
The international investigators have disputed the fire theory, saying they have yet to find sufficient evidence.
The Mexican attorney general has declared them all dead but their relatives still want proof of what happened that night, and justice.

One is ransomware that encrypts data and demands payment before files are released.
The other is spyware that watches what users do and scoops up valuable information.
Experts said they represented a threat because their creators were letting anyone use them for free.
The two programs were uncovered by the security firms Fortinet and AlienVault, which found a portal on the Tor ""dark web"" network that acted as a shopfront for both.
In a blog, Fortinet said the site claimed that the creators behind it were professional software engineers with ""extensive experience"" of creating working code.
Those wishing to use either of the programs had been urged to get in touch and provide details of how they wanted the malware to be set up. The malware's creators had said that payments made by ransomware victims would be split between themselves and their customers.
Researchers at Fortinet contacted the ransomware writers pretending they were interested in using the product and, soon afterwards, were sent a sample of the malware.
Analysis revealed that it used much less sophisticated encryption than the many variants seen targeting Windows machines, said the firm.
However, they added, any files scrambled with the ransomware would be completely lost because it did a very poor job of handling the decryption keys needed to restore data.
""Even if it is far inferior to most current ransomware targeting Windows, it doesn't fail to encrypt victim's files or prevent access to important files, thereby causing real damage,"" wrote the researchers.
The free Macspy spyware, offered via the same site, can log which keys are pressed, take screenshots and tap into a machine's microphone.
In its analysis, AlienVault researcher Peter Ewane said the malicious code in the spyware tried hard to evade many of the standard ways security programs spot and stop such programs.
Mr Ewane said Mac users needed to start being more vigilant as malware creators targeted them.
""As OS X continues to grow in market share we can expect malware authors to invest greater amounts of time in producing malware for this platform.""
Statistics gathered by McAfee suggest that there are now about 450,000 malicious programs aimed at Macs - far fewer than the 23 million targeting Windows users.
Aamir Lakhani from Fortinet said Mac users should make sure their machines were kept up to date with the latest software patches and be wary of messages they receive via email.
""Mac ransomware is definitely becoming bigger,"" he told EWeek. ""Although market share is still small, hackers know that there is valuable data on the Mac.""

The script in the site targeted visitors using the anonymising web browser Tor and sent information about their computers to a server in France.
The code may have been written by a law enforcement agency and there are fears it could have been used on other sites to track law-abiding people.
An update to the Tor browser has disabled the tracker.
Tor is designed to let people access pages from the so-called dark web and browse free from surveillance.
But the hidden code in the illicit website exploited a security flaw in Tor to send user information back to a mysterious server in France.
The vulnerability also affected the Mozilla's Firefox browser, on which Tor is based.
Technology news site Motherboard found online posts referring to the discovery of the tracking code on the child sex abuse website.
One user described the code as a network investigative technique (Nit), which can be used by law enforcement to help identify people browsing the web anonymously.
The website in question was shut down on 15 November.
The party behind the tracking code has not been identified, but one security researcher told news site Ars Technica that a majority of the code matched a script deployed by the FBI in 2013.
Daniel Veditz, security lead at Firefox-maker Mozilla, said in a blog: ""The exploit in this case works in essentially the same way as the 'network investigative technique' used by [the] FBI to deanonymise Tor users.
""This similarity has led to speculation that this exploit was created by FBI or another law enforcement agency.  As of now, we do not know whether this is the case.
""If this exploit was in fact developed and deployed by a government agency, the fact that it has been published and can now be used by anyone to attack Firefox users is a clear demonstration of how supposedly limited government hacking can become a threat to the broader web.""
The security flaw has now been patched in both Firefox and Tor.",Yes
525,14,spyware,Malware found on laptops given out by government,21 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55749959,"Some of the laptops given out in England to support vulnerable children home-schooling during lockdown contain malware, BBC News has learned.
Teachers shared details on an online forum about suspicious files found on devices sent to a Bradford school.
The malware, which they said appeared to be contacting Russian servers, is believed to have been found on laptops given to a handful of schools.
The Department for Education said it was aware and urgently investigating.
A DfE official told BBC News: ""We are aware of an issue with a small number of devices. And we are investigating as an urgent priority to resolve the matter as soon as possible.
""DfE IT teams are in touch with those who have reported this issue.""
""We believe this is not widespread.""
Geo, the firm which made the laptops, told the BBC: ""We have been working closely with the Department for Education regarding a reported issue on a very small number of devices. We are providing our full support during their investigation.
""We take all matters of security extremely seriously. Any schools that have concerns should contact the Department for Education.""
According to the forum, the Windows laptops contained Gamarue.I, a worm identified by Microsoft in 2012.
The government has so far sent schools more than 800,000 laptops, as it tries to distribute more than a million devices to disadvantaged pupils who may not have access at home.
""Upon unboxing and preparing them, it was discovered that a number of the laptops were infected with a self-propagating network worm,"" wrote Marium Haque, deputy director of Education and Learning at Bradford Council.
She recommended that schools also check their networks ""as an added precaution"".
Information security consultant Paul Moore told the BBC that the Gamarue worm ""presents a very severe threat to any PC or network"".
""Ideally users should reboot into safe mode and run a full scan with an anti-virus product,"" he said.
""However with this type of malware, it is advisable to seek professional assistance in order to ensure it has been correctly removed.""
The malware in question installs spyware which can gather information about browsing habits, as well as harvest personal information such as banking details.
""The fact that these devices were not checked and scrubbed before being sent to vulnerable children is a concern,"" said George Glass, head of threat intelligence at security firm Redscan.",Yes
526,15,spyware,Apple tackles iPhone one-tap spyware flaws,26 August 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37185544,"Flaws in Apple's iOS operating system have been discovered that made it possible to install spyware on a target's device merely by getting them to click on a link.
The discovery was made after a human rights lawyer alerted security researchers to unsolicited text messages he had received.
They discovered three previously unknown flaws within Apple's code.
Apple has since released a software update that addresses the problem.
The two security firms involved, Citizen Lab and Lookout, said they had held back details of the discovery until the fix had been issued.
The lawyer, Ahmed Mansoor, received the text messages on 10 and 11 August.
The texts promised to reveal ""secrets"" about people allegedly being tortured in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s jails if he tapped the links.
Had he done so, Citizen Lab says, his iPhone 6 would have been ""jailbroken"", meaning unauthorised software could have been installed.
""Once infected, Mansoor's phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone's camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,"" said Citizen Lab.
""We are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as part of a targeted attack campaign, making this a rare find.""
The researchers say they believe the spyware involved was created by NSO Group, an Israeli ""cyber-war"" company.
""[It is] the most sophisticated spyware package we've seen,"" said Lookout.
""It takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile - always connected (wi-fi, 3G/4G), voice communications, camera, email, messaging, GPS, passwords, and contact lists.""
This is in many ways a textbook case of the cybersecurity community acting precisely as it should. Researchers were alerted to a vulnerability, investigated it, and made Apple, the company responsible for fixing it, aware so it could issue a fix. Apple, to its credit, understood the severity and acted quickly - it took them just 10 days.
These types of vulnerabilities are rare and extremely lucrative. A genuine ""zero day"" - the name given to previously unknown security flaws - can be sold for upwards of $1m when it affects a major piece of software like Apple's iOS. In this case, it looks like several zero days were combined to make a hugely sophisticated attack package.
Now attention is shifting to the secretive organisation said to be behind the attack, the NSO Group, described by researchers as a cyber arms dealer, and described by itself as firm capable of being a ""ghost"" on victims' devices - working undetected but gathering enormous amounts of private data.
According to Privacy International, NSO Group has sold its products to clients in Mexico and in Panama - but little is known about other deals involving the company which is said to be worth more than $1bn.
Pressure is also being put on Francisco Partners Ltd, the San Francisco-based venture capital firm that has a controlling stake in NSO Group. It is yet to comment on the controversial attack.
NSO has issued a statement acknowledging that it makes technology used to ""combat terror and crime"" but said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents and made no reference to the specific spyware involved.
""These are rather rare zero-day flaws,"" commented security expert Prof Alan Woodward, referring to the technical name for previously unknown vulnerabilities.
""To have several found at once is even rarer. As can be seen from how these have been exploited to date, it represents a serious threat to the security and privacy of iOS users.
""Apple has been remarkably responsive in providing fixes for these issues, so I would encourage any iOS users to update to the latest version of the operating system.""
For its part, Apple has limited itself to saying: ""We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5. We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.""",Yes
527,16,spyware,French firm offered spyware to 'find out if your son is gay',23 August 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41022827,"A French company offering ""invisible PC spy software"" has been criticised after it said its product could be used ""to find out if your son is gay"".
Listing a series of ""clues"", the company, Fireworld, suggested that ""hacking his Facebook account"" and seeing if he had visited gay websites could confirm a parent's suspicions.
The company has since taken down the article.
The post was highlighted by a French youth LGBT rights group.
L'Amicale des jeunes du Refuge's thread about Fireworld's article (in French) was retweeted by French Secretary of State for Equality MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa, who wrote that it showed that ""homophobia and sexism have their roots in the same gender stereotypes. We will fight them together"".
In its online article, since removed, the firm said that ""family is fundamental. That's why the sexual orientation of your children, directly responsible for the continuation of your family, is very important to you"".
The article went on to list the clues that might cause a parent to suspect that their son might be gay. The article makes no mention of female homosexuality.
They include ""taking good care of himself"", being more interested in reading and theatre than in football, being shy as a young boy, having certain piercings and liking female singers and divas.
It then suggested a variety of ways to be sure, including ""monitoring his Facebook use"", seeing ""if he has visited gay forums"" and ""spying on his private messages"".
In a response to L'Amicale des jeunes du Refuge, Fireworld wrote that ""the article had the sole aim of improving search engine optimisation and was never intended to be read by humans"".
""We regret not having reflected on the consequences of this type of content..."" the firm emailed. ""We sincerely apologise to all those who may have felt offended by this content,"" it added.
However, the English language version of Fireworld's site suggests a range of scenarios in which a potential customer might want to monitor someone else's computer, including ""control your teenage offspring's PC"", checking ""what your employees are doing"" and ""detecting infidelity in your marriage or relationship"".
It is not legal in France to install spyware on someone else's computer in order to monitor it, without their knowledge.
Fireworld points out to customers that they must comply with the law when using their products. However, it says, ""installing [its product] to make sure that your children are not endangering themselves on the Internet or on social networks, come[s] closer to being legal"".
French newspaper Liberation reports that spyware vendors are usually more subtle in their claims for their products, as French law does not allow advertising which incentivises the illegal use of such tools.
There are a range of products on the market that offer parental monitoring and report back to parents on what their children have been doing online.",Yes

529,18,spyware,Spyware maker faces legal battle over alleged affair,18 August 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37118673,"A spyware company faces legal action after a US court ruled that its software was used unlawfully to intercept an unwitting man's messages.
Javier Luis started an online friendship with Catherine Zang in 2009.
Her husband used WebWatcher spyware to track the pair's private emails and online chats over several months, as evidence for divorce proceedings.
The US appeal court has now ruled 2-1 that Mr Luis can sue the software firm Awareness Technologies.
Mr Luis claims the software, which logged web history, searches, chat logs and email threads, illegally intercepted his communications with Ms Zang.
Legal action by Mr Luis against Mr Zang and other unnamed parties has been settled.
But Mr Luis pursued his case against Awareness after a district court initially dismissed his claims against the company.
While the two never met in person, Mr Luis said he developed ""a caring relationship"" with Ms Zang.
Mr Zang grew suspicious that his wife was conversing with other men, and installed the WebWatcher software on a shared computer to intercept her messages in real time.
He read copies of the messages on the WebWatcher servers, and used the information to divorce Ms Zang on terms favourable to him in 2010.
WebWatcher is marketed as parental monitoring software for ensuring children are using technology appropriately.
Its terms of use require that the software is only installed on devices belonging to the purchaser or with permission to monitor a phone or computer belonging to someone else.
Awareness Technologies denied Mr Luis' assertions that it intercepted the communications - illegal under the US Wiretap Act - arguing it merely stored them as data.
It claimed that the term intercept applied only to situations in which a device captures a communication ""either before [it] reaches the intended recipient or contemporaneous with the transmission not after it reaches the destination where it is placed in electronic storage.""
The court of appeals disagreed. It concluded that Mr Luis ""has indeed alleged enough facts to reasonably infer that Awareness intercepted his communications"".
Awareness has been contacted for comment.
The case has now been sent back to the lower court for it to continue.",Yes

531,20,spyware,The Dissident: Jamal Khashoggi documentary points finger at Saudi Arabia's crown prince,27 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56210362,"The Oscar-winning director of a documentary investigating the murder of Jamal Khashoggi says he does not believe Saudi Arabia's crown prince will ever face formal investigation for his killing.
A newly-released US CIA report has implicated Mohammed bin Salman in the death of the Saudi journalist, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.
Bryan Fogel's film The Dissident explores what happened to Khashoggi and who might have ordered his murder. His body has never been recovered and the Saudi crown prince has denied involvement.
In November 2019, five men were tried and sentenced to death in a Saudi court for Khashoggi's killing and three others were jailed. The death sentences were later commuted to 20 years in prison.
Using transcripts obtained from the Turkish government, Fogel's film suggests that Khashoggi, a journalist for the Washington Post who had exiled himself to the US, was suffocated and then dismembered inside the consulate.
The film also investigates the use of spyware and phone hacking against Saudi activists living in exile. These include Canada-based video blogger Omar Abdulaziz, with whom Khashoggi was in close contact before his death.
""I don't believe the crown prince is ever going to face an Interpol arrest warrant that'll pick him up when he lands his private jet somewhere and haul him off to The Hague or extradite him to Istanbul or the US,"" says Fogel. ""That's never going to happen.
""This is the environment that we find ourselves in, which is constantly in conflict with human rights. Leaders like Mohammed bin Salman see their money can buy their way out of these sorts of events, and there isn't accountability unless there's a cumulative and combined effort from countries.""
Fogel says he welcomes a re-evaluation of ties between the US and Saudi Arabia under the Biden administration, citing the close relationship the two countries had during Donald Trump's presidency.
""Biden's definitely not following the playbook of Donald Trump,"" the US director comments. ""Signing off [on] the declassification and releasing the CIA findings into Khashoggi's murder is a blow to US-Saudi relations.""
According to Fogel, the recent release of human rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul after almost three years in detention is ""clearly a peace offering to the Biden administration"".
""There appears to be support from both Democrats and Republicans to re-examine the relationship with Saudi Arabia in the light of the war in Yemen, so time will tell,"" he continues.
Fogel's last investigative film, Icarus, won an Oscar in 2018 for exposing the scandal of state-sponsored Russian doping in athletics. The Dissident was also critically acclaimed following its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020, yet Fogel queries why global streaming services including Amazon and Netflix have not bought the film for their platforms.
""I think the film lays bare that unfortunately there is a contrition and a cowardice amongst these huge companies to take on subject matter that might affect their shareholder value, or their business or investor interests, even though they know hundreds of millions of people would be interested in watching the film,"" he argues.
Fogel is also critical of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, who also owns the Washington Post, the newspaper that employed Khashoggi.
""He chose not to acquire this film for global distribution on his platform,"" Fogel says. ""But a few months later, he acquired Souq, the so-called Amazon of Saudi Arabia.""
Amazon actually acquired Souq.com in 2017, subsequently rebranding it as Amazon.ae.
""Is Amazon still doing business with Saudi Arabia? Yes,"" says Fogel. ""Is he actually standing up for the murder of his employee? He's certainly made some statements, but actions speak louder than words.""
Fogel's film includes footage of a 2017 vigil held near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul which Bezos attended and spoke at.
""I'm not mad at any of these companies,"" the director goes on. ""It's business. But it's disappointing as this sort of behaviour eventually allows murders like Jamal Khashoggi's to happen, and when there's no standing up for content like this it becomes increasingly difficult for filmmakers like myself. But I'm optimistic that the climate will change.""
The aim of The Dissident, its director says, is not to make ""an archival film"". ""It's to make a living, breathing thriller that looks deeply into Khashoggi's murder and the ramifications of it,"" he contends.
Fogel also interviews Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Turkish scientist Hatice Cengiz, as well as Omar Abdulaziz, whose activism was financially supported by Khashoggi.
The film puts forward the theory that this act may have tipped Jamal Khashoggi into being viewed as an activist and dissident himself, rather than just an outspoken journalist.
""But I think even in the final weeks of Jamal's life he never saw himself as a dissident,"" Fogel argues. ""He was holding onto the notion that he was a journalist. Yet what you see in the film is that the work he was doing and what he was writing about made him one, at least as we understand it.
""Jamal Khashoggi was someone who wanted to make his country a better place and was silenced in the most horrific way,"" Fogel concludes.
""In the film, you'll see that the choice he faced was either to stay in Saudi Arabia and be silent, or leave Saudi, risk his life and go into exile and speak truth to power. It cost him his life.""
The Dissident will have its UK premiere online at the Glasgow Film Festival on 6 March.

532,21,spyware,Top Catalan politician accuses Spain of 'political spying',14 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-53409702,"A leading Catalan pro-independence politician has accused the Spanish government of spying on his mobile phone.
Roger Torrent, speaker of the Catalan parliament, spoke out after details of the alleged espionage were revealed in a joint investigation by the Guardian and El Pais newspapers.
Mr Torrent said it was proof of ""political spying against political opponents"" in Spain.
Madrid has denied the allegations.
The Guardian and El Pais newspapers reported that Mr Torrent had been warned that his phone was targeted last year using Pegasus, an Israeli-made spyware tool.
The makers of the tool say it is only sold to governments to track criminals and terrorists.
Mr Torrent was warned about the spyware by researchers working with WhatsApp.
Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Torrent called for a full investigation into what happened.
""This is the first time that we have concrete confirmation of what many of us knew and had been denouncing... We knew that illegal practices were being directed against the independence cause. Now we have certain proof,"" he said.
The office of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez denied the accusations.
A spokeswoman told AFP news agency the government was not aware that Mr Torrent and another former Catalan lawmaker ""had been subjected to a hacking attack via their mobile phones"".
""In Spain, any intervention concerning a mobile phone is always done legally,"" she said.
Catalonia's drive for independence has plunged Spain into its biggest political crisis in 40 years. The region had its autonomy suspended for almost seven months by Madrid after a failed bid to break away in 2017.
In October last year, Spain's Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan politicians and activists to jail terms of between nine and 13 years for that independence bid.",Yes

Tracking and listening devices, often disguised as everyday objects, retail online for under Â£50 and are easy to install, says the Digital-Trust.
There are no official figures but ""digital abuse"" is often experienced by victims of domestic violence, it adds.
People with abusive partners should also be wary of gadgets given to their children, the charity warns.
""Eighteen months ago I issued advice to domestic violence groups about fathers gifting smartphones or even allowing them to take them on access visits because it is so easy for abusers to use them as surveillance,"" said Jennifer Perry, chief executive of the newly formed Digital-Trust.
""I recommend children are given inexpensive pay as you go phones when visiting an abusive parent.""
Ms Perry said incidents of digital abuse - ranging from surveillance to accessing voicemails, emails and cloud accounts, is escalating in the UK.
In addition cheap surveillance devices - small GPS trackers, listening devices and cameras hidden inside books, lamps, plug sockets and carbon monoxide detectors, are freely available online despite some of them being illegal.
""If I have a domestic violence victim I assume there will be some type of digital abuse - it's not the exception, it's the assumption,"" she told the BBC.
Ms Perry added that in her experience it is more likely to happen to female victims.
""I get a lot of criticism for saying it but I don't see this level or type of surveillance used against male victims,"" she added.
""I see men using it against women. It is rare to see a man targeted surveillance-wise by women.""
Ms Perry began working in the field of e-crime in 2005. She said that often victims need very specific advice, which is not easily available.
""Safety advice is often done by topic but if you don't know what you're looking for it doesn't help,"" she added.
""We'll ask a series of questions that deal with the symptoms - are you being harassed by your partner? Is he showing up where you are? Has he had access to your house or your PC?""
Smartphone owners may have not set up their device themselves so may not know what has been installed on it, she added.
""The main thing I try to do is stop any form of data leaking. That's my number one objective,"" Ms Perry said.

Fraud prevention organisation Cifas said fraudsters were sharing tips and getting more sophisticated in their attempts to steal money.
Cases of a particular scam targeting shoppers, which often spikes at Christmas, have tripled this year.
Criminals harvest personal information then buy items in someone else's name.
The so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff.
Criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. Online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers.
Cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. This is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines.
Criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again.
There were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from January to September recorded by Cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019.
There was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones.
Cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies.
Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""We often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so I would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police.""
Last month, banking trade body UK Finance warned criminals were using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails.

535,24,spyware,Security firms uncover 'sophisticated' Regin spyware,24 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30145265,"An ""extremely complex"" and ""stealthy"" spying program has been stealing data from ISPs, energy companies, airlines and research-and-development labs, a security company has said.
With a ""degree of technical competence rarely seen"", Regin had probably taken years to develop, Symantec said.
And a nation state may have written it to serve its spying agencies' needs.
The program had been used in ""systematic spying campaigns"" over the past six years, Symantec said.
Aimed at Windows users, Regin slowly infiltrated its targets, taking care at each stage to hide its tracks, the company said.
""Many components of Regin remain undiscovered and additional functionality and versions may exist,"" it added.
""Its design makes it highly suited for persistent, long-term surveillance operations against targets.""
Jason Steer, director of technology strategy at security firm FireEye, said: ""These types of toolkits have existed for a few years now.""
He added: ""It's a challenge to the whole security industry as to how they find these malicious and sophisticated pieces of code,""
Security firms were better at spotting such things even though Regin and its ilk were built to fool modern-day tools that look for malicious programs and monitor activity to spot anything suspicious. The techniques Regin used to sneak on to a network and communicate with its creators were very complicated, he said.
""It's clearly been written by someone that has much more than making money in mind,"" he said.
Mr Steer said the tip-offs about Regin and similarly sophisticated threats often came from government agencies who kept an eye on the cyber spying capabilities of both friendly and hostile nations.
Victims had been infected via spoofed versions of well-known websites and by exploiting known vulnerabilities in web browser software, said Symantec in a detailed analysis.
In a blogpost, security company F-Secure said it had first encountered Regin in 2009 after investigating what was making a server on the network of one of its customers crash repeatedly. Closer investigation revealed the culprit to be Regin which was attempting to insert itself into the heart of the software controlling the server.
Chief research officer Mikko Hypponen said: ""Finding malware of this calibre is very rare.
""We're still missing big parts of the puzzle.""
""Nevertheless, it's obvious this is a very complicated malware written by a well-equipped nation-state."" He added that the malware did not look like it originated in China or Russia - the places suspected of creating many other stealthy, spying programs.
Security firm Kaspersky Lab said it too had spotted Regin being used to infiltrate networks and steal data. In one attack, Regin was used to gather administrative details for a mobile phone network in the Middle East that, if used, would have given attackers control over the system.
Symantec said it had captured the first copies of Regin in a small number of organisations between 2008 and 2011.
Soon after, the malware had appeared to have been withdrawn, but a new version found in 2013 was now being actively used.
Only about 100 Regin infections have so far been identified.

536,25,spyware,Spyware demo shows how spooks hack mobile phones,5 August 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33772261,"Intelligence agencies' secretive techniques for spying on mobile phones are seldom made public.
But a UK security firm has shown the BBC how one tool, sold around the world to spooks, actually works.
It allows spies to take secret pictures with a phone's camera and record conversations with the microphone, without the phone owner knowing.
Hacking Team's software was recently stolen from the company by hackers and published on the web.
Almost any data on a phone, tablet or PC can be accessed by the tool and it is fascinating how much it can do.
When Joe Greenwood, of cybersecurity firm 4Armed, saw that source code for the program had been dumped online by hackers, he couldn't resist experimenting with it.
Although he had to fiddle with the code to make it work, it only took a day before he had it up and running.
The software consists of the surveillance console, which displays data retrieved from a hacked device, and malware planted on the target device itself.
4Armed was careful to note that using it to spy on someone without their consent would be against the law.
After testing the software on his own PC, Mr Greenwood soon realised the scope of its capabilities.
""You can download files, record microphones, webcam images, websites visited, see what programs are running, intercept Skype calls,"" he told the BBC.
The software even has some in-built features to track Bitcoin payments, which can be difficult to associate with individuals without additional data about when and how transactions were performed.
In a live demonstration of the system, Mr Greenwood showed how an infected phone could be made to record audio from the microphone, even when the device was locked, and use the phone's camera without its owner knowing.
""We can actually take photos without them realising.
""So the camera in the background is running, taking photos every number of seconds,"" explained Mr Greenwood.
It was also possible to listen in on phone calls, access the list of contacts stored on the device and track what websites the phone user was visiting.
Both Mr Greenwood and 4Armed's technical director, Marc Wickenden, said they were surprised by the sleekness of the interface.
Both point out, though, that customers could be paying upwards of Â£1m for the software and would expect it to be user-friendly, especially if it was intended for use by law enforcers on the beat.
For the tracked user, though, there are very few ways of finding out that they are being watched.
One red flag, according to Mr Greenwood, is a sudden spike in network data usage, indicating that information is being sent somewhere in the background. Experienced spies, however, would be careful to minimise this in order to remain incognito.
At present, spy software like this is only likely to be secretly deployed on the phones and computers of people who are key targets for an intelligence agency.
The version of the spyware distributed online is now likely to be more easily detected by anti-virus programs because companies analysing the source code are in the process of updating their systems to recognise it.
Security expert Graham Cluley said it should be as easy to detect as malware.
""The danger will be that malicious hackers could take that code and augment it or change it so it no longer looks like Hacking Team's versions, which might avoid detection,"" he added.
The best course of action, said Mr Cluley, is to keep operating systems and software as up to date as possible.
In a statement, a spokesman for Hacking Team said it advised its customers not to use the software once the breach was discovered.
""As soon as the event was discovered, Hacking Team immediately advised all clients to discontinue the use of that version of the software, and the company provided a patch to assure that client surveillance data and other information stored on client systems was secure.
""From the beginning Hacking Team has assumed that the code that has been released is compromised,"" he said.
The spokesman added that the software would be operated by clients of Hacking Team, not Hacking Team itself, and therefore no sensitive data relating to ongoing investigations had been compromised in the breach.
""Of course, there are many who would use for their own purposes the information released by the criminals who attacked Hacking Team.
""This was apparently not a concern of the attackers who recklessly published the material for all online.
""Compiling the software would take considerable technical skill, so not just anyone could do that, but that is not to say it is impossible,"" he said.",Yes

Symantec says the bug, named Regin, was probably created by a government and has been used for six years against a range of targets around the world.
Once installed on a computer, it can do things like capture screenshots, steal passwords or recover deleted files.
Experts say computers in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Ireland have been hit most.
It has been used to spy on government organisations, businesses and private individuals, they say.
Researchers say the sophistication of the software indicates that it is a cyber-espionage tool developed by a nation state.
They also said it likely took months, if not years, to develop and its creators have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks.
Sian John, a security strategist at Symantec, said: ""It looks like it comes from a Western organisation. It's the level of skill and expertise, the length of time over which it was developed.""

A German security firm reported on Tuesday that the Android-powered Star N9500 sent personal data to a computer server in China, adding that the Trojan could not be removed.
It said the malware was disguised as the legitimate Google Play Store app.
The handset remains on sale on Amazon, which could not be reached for comment.
But eBay said it was rolling out the ban globally.
""Due to reports that some Star 9500 smartphones are loaded with spyware, eBay is not allowing the sale of these devices as a precautionary measure,"" a spokesman told the BBC.
Although the brand Star is far from being a household name, the handset may have appealed to some customers because of its close resemblance to the Samsung Galaxy S4 coupled with the fact it sells for about a third of the cost.
Security firm G Data said it was alerted to the case after receiving tip-offs from its customers.
""The spyware runs in the background and cannot be detected by users,"" it said.
""Unbeknownst to the user, the smartphone sends personal data to a server located in China and is able to covertly install additional applications.
""This makes it possible to retrieve personal data, intercept calls and online banking data, read emails and text messages or control the camera and microphone remotely.
""The program also blocks the installation of security updates.""
The Associated Press news agency has reported that although several Shenzhen-based firms used eBay and other sites to sell the model, it had been unable to track down the manufacturer.
If the allegations are true, it is not known whether the manufacturer itself would have been aware of what was being done at its plant.
This is not the first time that a Chinese factory has been accused of shipping devices preinstalled with malware.
In 2012 Microsoft reported that several PC makers in the country had been found to load malicious programs onto their computers.
Then, last year German firm E-Plus reported that some of its China-made Android smartphones were being shipped with SD memory cards infected with a computer worm.",Yes
539,28,spyware,Post Prism: The new meaning of spyware,22 November 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24931374,"If you thought you were pretty clever knowing that spyware refers to pieces of malicious code put on computers in order for cybercriminals to steal your passwords and other IDs, think again.
These days it has a much more literal sense, at least if the latest documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden to the Der Spiegel newspaper are to be believed.
The documents allege that spies are regularly using tools more usually associated with cybercriminals.
It is alleged UK spy agency GCHQ operatives created fake web pages that injected malware into the computers of engineers running one of Belgium's largest telecommunications companies in order to be able to access its systems.
""We have to realise that a number of GCHQ staff are indeed hackers,  but licensed by the state and protected by the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and ministerial warrant,"" said digital forensic expert Prof Peter Sommer.
""They will deploy every type of hacker trick to achieve their aims.""
It is a view endorsed by Dwayne Melancon, chief technology officer of security firm Tripwire and a man used to looking at malicious code as part of his daily job.
""It seems you can't throw a rock these days without hitting a nation state surveillance operation,"" he said.
It raised some pretty fundamental questions about whom we trust online, said Prof Alan Woodward, security expert and lecturer at Surrey University, who has undertaken consultancy work for GCHQ.
""When the criminals start to look like law enforcement, that is a very dangerous practice,"" he said.
""Where do you draw the line? Is it with engineers who control machines or should they be allowed to have malware on everyone's PC 'just in case' they want to use it as a route to some high value target?""
There is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that the use of malware is standard practice for the police as well as the intelligence services.
In the summer it was revealed that the FBI used mobile malware to infect and control a suspect's handset.
And in September the FBI admitted that it had planted hidden code on the dark net, a part of the internet favoured by cybercriminals because it is unreachable by standard search engines.
Security researchers who dissected the code found it exploited a security hole in Firefox, which reported back to a mysterious server in northern Virginia.
Meanwhile leaked German police documents suggest that the Federal Criminal Police Office is working on its own surveillance software, which it hopes to have ready by the end of 2014.
Prof Sommer said: ""I'd hope that the intelligence service uses highly targeted malware.
""So if they target someone specifically, they send an email with a booby trap - but they will only be sending it to the target and the malware wouldn't have any self-replicating properties.""
But Mr Melancon is not so sure, particularly if the authorities are using so-called ""watering hole"" websites, which are popular with specific groups of users.
In the Belgian case, GCHQ is alleged to have targeted LinkedIn and tech news site Slashdot in order to lure the engineers it was targeting.
""Such sites are notoriously indiscriminate,"" said Mr Melancon.
"" You can limit the risk of accidental infection of uninvolved persons, but you can't eliminate that risk entirely.
""Collateral damage and inadvertent surveillance of non-targeted individuals is almost certain.""
The other big question raised by the allegations published by Der Spiegel is just whom the spooks are after.
If you hear the word ""target"" from an intelligence agency, you probably assume they are referring to a terrorist or some other individual intent on harm.
What the Belgian case reveals is that engineers can also be targets.
So is it ethical to put malware on the computer of an innocent employee who just happens to have access to a computer system you may want to look at?
""If the result is damaging or destroying data or property, then it could certainly be deemed unethical by a reasonable person.
""Likewise, violating the civil liberties of an individual crosses the ethical line. You can rationalise damage to engineers by lumping them into a collective as part of 'their organisation', but this is very subjective,"" said Mr Melancon.
For its part, GCHQ offered a pretty standard response to the particular allegations about breaking into Belgian servers.
""All GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensure that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the Interception and intelligence services commissioners and the Intelligence and Security Committee,"" it said.
The only way to be sure you too do not become a ""target"" is to ""consider all networks untrustworthy"", according to Robert Hansen, technical evangelist at WhiteHat Security.
""Unfortunately, there isn't much hope for the individual because most of the things that would otherwise secure the user have historically been controlled by groups that have close ties to the government,"" he said.
He is talking about the companies that register websites and encryption certificates.
Sir Tim Berners Lee, inventor of the world wide web, has described attempts by spy agencies to crack encryption as ""appalling and foolish"".
But through it all the general public seems to have been remarkably sanguine.
Prof Sommer said: ""In Germany and the US people are outraged but in the UK that is less the case.
""People are rather proud of what GCHQ did during the war and they think it probably is not going to affect me.""
What the Snowden leaks have dispelled once and for all is any lurking suspicion that the security forces are some bumbling Johnny English sort of outfit.
""The fact is that intelligence agencies are using advanced techniques actually more advanced than those used by criminals,"" said Amichai Shulman, chief technology officer of security firm Imperva.
""We have enough proof now that governments do have the necessary technology and personnel that can effectively fight cybercrime. They just chose to put it to a different use.""",Yes
540,29,spyware,UAE Blackberry update was spyware,21 July 2009,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8161190.stm,"An update for Blackberry users in the United Arab Emirates could allow unauthorised access to private information and e-mails.The update was prompted by a text from UAE telecoms firm Etisalat, suggesting it would improve performance. Instead, the update resulted in crashes or drastically reduced battery life. Blackberry maker Research in Motion (RIM) said in a statement the update was not authorised, developed, or tested by RIM. Etisalat is a major telecommunications firm based in the UAE, with 145,000 Blackberry users on its books. In the statement, RIM told customers that ""Etisalat appears to have distributed a telecommunications surveillance application... independent sources have concluded that it is possible that the installed software could then enable unauthorised access to private or confidential information stored on the user's smartphone"". It adds that ""independent sources have concluded that the Etisalat update is not designed to improve performance of your BlackBerry Handheld, but rather to send received messages back to a central server"". The concern over this unauthorised access only came to light when users started reporting problems with their handsets. After downloading the update, users across the country noticed significantly reduced battery life, poor reception and in some cases, handsets stopped working altogether. Users have complained that the firm's customer service is unable to provide information on the problem. Initial advice led many users to simply buy new batteries. 'Surveillance solutions'The update has now been identified as an application developed by American firm SS8. The California-based company describes itself as a provider of ""lawful electronic intercept and surveillance solutions"". It is not clear why Etisalat wanted to include the software in the download. The firm issued a brief statement last week, calling the problem a ""slight technical fault"", saying that the ""upgrades were required for service enhancements"". Etisalat told BBC News that it stands by last week's statement and has not yet responded to further requests for comment. ""There may be a good reason they wanted to install the software,"" said one Blackberry user in Dubai who did not want to be named. ""But my biggest problem is that my phone won't work. If you call customer service you either can't get through, or they don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to do."" RIM has now issued its own update allowing users to remove the application. Customers of the country's rival service, Du, have not been affected.

541,30,spyware,Germany spyware: Minister calls for probe of state use,11 October 2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15253259,"Germany's justice minister has called for a national and state level probe into the use of controversial computer software to spy on people.
The German state of Bavaria has admitted using the spyware, but claimed it had acted within the law.
Three other states have also confirmed they have used spyware in order to investigate serious criminal offences, a German newspaper reports.
Use of the software was exposed by a German hacker group.
The Berlin-based Chaos Computer Club (CCC) said it had analysed a ""lawful interception"" malware programme called Federal Trojan, used by the German police force.
They found that, once installed, the programme allows its operators to monitor exactly what the user is looking at - from which websites they have visited, to the emails they send and receive and the calls made through Skype.
""The malware cannot only siphon away intimate data but also offers a remote control or backdoor functionality for uploading and executing arbitrary other programs,"" the group wrote on its website.
The program, it said, had ""significant design and implementation flaws"", which made ""all of the functionality available to anyone on the internet"".
The CCC had analysed a laptop allegedly belonging to a man accused of illegally exporting pharmaceuticals. His lawyer claims the Trojan program was installed on his client's computer when it passed through airport customs.
Bavaria Interior Minister Joachim Herrman has confirmed that state officials have been using the software since 2009 - though he made no mention of any specific incidents - and insisted that they had acted within the law. However, he promised a review of the software's use.
The German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported on Tuesday that three other states - Baden-Wurttemberg, Brandenburg and Lower Saxony had confirmed using spyware, although it is not clear if all four states had used the same software.
Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has called on the federal and state governments to launch an investigation into the matter.
""Trying to play down or trivialise the matter won't do,"" she said. ""The citizen, in both the public and private spheres, must be protected from snooping through strict state control mechanisms.""
The BBC's Stephen Evans says the incident has sparked a row because Germans, given the country's Nazi and Communist past, feel strongly about spying on citizens. Germany's constitution stipulates strict protection against it, he adds.",Yes
542,31,spyware,Pegasus breach: Will quitting WhatsApp make your phone safer?,4 November 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-50285350,"With WhatsApp confirming that its software was used to install spyware on phones, many are considering deleting the popular messaging app. However, experts say this is not the answer.
There has been considerable outrage and worry in many countries including India, after WhatsApp confirmed that some of its users were targeted with spyware.
Some in the country have pointed fingers at the government, accusing them of being behind the hack, given that the group accused of creating the software, NSO Group, reportedly sells only to governments.
WhatsApp has sued the company over the allegations, which it has strongly rejected. The Indian government has also denied involvement.
Some users have been looking at options other than WhatsApp, including messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, believing that they are more secure.
But experts say that WhatsApp, an app used by approximately 1.5 billion people in 180 countries and 400 million in India, is bearing the brunt of a hack that is not completely its fault.
While a vulnerability in the app's video-calling feature allowed the spyware to go through without user intervention, it ultimately took over the phone because of gaps in the phone's operating systems.
""The vulnerabilities the spyware exploited were at the level of the operating system, be it Android or Apple,"" Vinay Kesari, a technology lawyer specialising in privacy, said.
""If there's spyware in your handset, everything that is readable or even whatever that comes through your camera or mic is at risk,"" technology writer Prasanto K Roy said.
WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are encrypted end-to-end. This means they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device.
""In this case, it doesn't matter if the app is end-to-end encrypted or not - once spyware is on your handset, hackers are able to see whatever is on your phone as you see it - this is already decrypted and in a readable form at this stage,"" Mr Kesari said.
""You may as well have unlocked your phone and handed it over,"" he added. ""But importantly, this breach shows just how vulnerable operating systems are.""
Much of the chatter has focused on switching to other messaging apps, particularly Signal, which is known for its open source code - but does that mean your phone would be better protected against spyware?
Not necessarily, they say.
""With Signal, there is an added layer of transparency because they release their code to the public - so if you are a sophisticated coder, and the company says they have fixed a bug, you can access the code and see for yourself,"" Mr Kesari said.
""But that doesn't mean the app has an added layer of protection against such attacks.""
Mr Roy told the BBC that the attack went beyond the app.
""For those whose handsets were compromised, all their information was at risk - not just WhatsApp,"" Mr Roy said.
As of now, there is no reason to believe that WhatsApp is ""any less safe"" than other apps, he added.",Yes

544,33,spyware,'I was a victim of the WhatsApp hack',31 October 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50249859,"In April, Faustin Rukundo received a mysterious call over WhatsApp from a number he did not recognise.
He answered, but the line was silent and then it went dead. He tried calling back but nobody answered.
He didn't know it but his phone had been compromised.
As a Rwandan exile living in Leeds, Mr Rukundo was already privacy conscious. He searched for the number online and found the dialling code was from Sweden.
Strange, he thought. But he soon forgot about it.
Then the number called once more. Again nobody picked up.
There were also missed calls from other numbers he did not recognise and he began to get worried about his family's safety, so he bought a new phone.
Within a day, the unknown number called again.
""I tried to answer and they hung up before I heard any voice,"" Mr Rukundo told the BBC.
""Whenever I called back, no-one answered. I realised something was wrong when I started seeing files missing from the phone.
""I spoke to my colleagues at the Rwanda National Congress and they too had similar experiences. They were getting missed calls from the same numbers as me.""
The Rwanda National Congress is a group that opposes the Rwandan regime.
It was not until May, when Mr Rukundo read reports that WhatsApp had been hacked, that he realised what had happened.
""I first read the story about the WhatsApp hack on the BBC and thought, 'Wow, this could explain what's happened to me,'"" he said.
""I changed my phone and realised my mistake. They were following my number around and putting the spy software on each new device by calling the same number.""
For months, Mr Rukundo was convinced that he and his colleagues were some of the estimated 1,400 people targeted by attackers exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp.
But it was only confirmed to him this week following a call from Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.
For six months, the organisation has been working with Facebook to investigate the hack and find out who was affected.
Researchers there say: ""As part of our investigation into the incident, Citizen Lab has identified over 100 cases of abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe.""
Mr Rukundo's profile as an outspoken critic of the Rwandan regime is consistent with the sort of people who were targets for this spyware.
It was allegedly built and sold by the Israel-based NSO Group and sold to governments around the world.
Hackers used the software to spy on journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents and diplomats.
Mr Rukundo says he has not had any calls since the original hack, but the experience has made him and his family feel paranoid and scared.
""Honestly, even before they confirmed this, we were gutted and terrified. It looks like they only bugged my phone for around two weeks but they had access to everything,"" he told the BBC.
""Not only my activity during that time but my whole email history and all my contacts and connections. Everything is watched, the computers, our phones, nothing is safe. Even when we talk, they could be listening. I still don't feel safe.""
Mr Rukundo fled Rwanda in 2005 when critics of the government were being arrested and jailed. He says he fought to have his wife released after she was kidnapped and detained for two months on a family visit in 2007.
Facebook, the owner of WhatsApp, is attempting to sue the NSO Group.
The NSO Group denies any wrongdoing.
In court documents, Facebook accuses the company of exploiting a then-unknown vulnerability in WhatsApp.
The app is used by approximately 1.5 billion people in 180 countries.
The service is popular for its end-to-end encryption, which means messages are scrambled as they travel across the internet, making them unreadable if intercepted.
The filing at the US District Court of Northern California describes how the spyware was allegedly installed.
The powerful software known as Pegasus is an NSO Group product that can remotely and covertly extract valuable intelligence from mobile devices, by sharing all phone activity including communications and location data with the attacker.
In previous spyware attacks, victims have been tricked into downloading the software by clicking on booby-trapped web links.
But with the WhatsApp hack, Facebook alleges that it was installed on victims' phones without them taking any action at all.
The company says that between January 2018 and May 2019, NSO Group created WhatsApp accounts using telephone numbers registered in different counties, including Cyprus, Israel, Brazil, Indonesia, Sweden and the Netherlands.
Then in April and May, the victims were attacked with a phone call over WhatsApp, it is claimed.
The filing says: ""To avoid the technical restrictions built into WhatsApp Signaling Servers, defendants formatted call initiation messages containing malicious code to appear like a legitimate call and concealed the code within call settings.
""Disguising the malicious code as call settings enabled defendants to deliver it to the target device and made the malicious code appear as if it originated from WhatsApp Signaling Servers.""
The victims would be completely unaware that they had been bugged. In some cases the only thing they noticed were mysterious missed calls in WhatsApp logs.
The document states that Facebook:
NSO Group has been accused of supplying the spyware that let the killers of journalist Jamal Khashoggi track him down.
NSO Group denies involvement in that incident and says it will fight these latest allegations.
""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,"" the company said in a statement to the BBC.
""The sole purpose of NSO Group is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.""",Yes

Rob Freeman, Click's very own Mr Fixit, troubleshoots your PC problems and helps you get the most out of your computer. This week he talks you through Microsoft PowerPoint, firewalls and anti-spyware software.
You look everywhere on the web nowadays and it is all about sharing media. So, what happens when you try to share something, and cannot?
""I have done a presentation in PowerPoint and want it to run independently. I just want the person viewing the presentation to see it without running powerpoint.""
Lawrenton Haick, Ghana
The solution you want could be two different things, so I will tell you both of them just in case.
First, if you want them to see just the presentation slides, then save your presentation as a Powerpoint show.
After you have prepared your presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint, go to the file menu and choose 'Save As'. Choose a filename as normal, but instead of saving it as a PPT file, as you would normally, drop down the menu and choose PowerPoint Show - it has a PPS file extension.
When you open that PPS file, it will immediately show your slides full screen.
This method is sometimes used by people who think that they can prevent people editing their slides - that is not true.
Second, if you have a PowerPoint file, but the person viewing it does not have PowerPoint installed on their computer, then they need to download the free PowerPoint viewer from Microsoft (http://tinyurl.com/5y728).

""I haven't got round to downloading Service Pack 2 for Windows XP, I run the ZoneAlarm firewall which was free and probably not the best firewall out there, but it's better than nothing. I also have Spybot Search & Destroy. With the service pack, will I be able to do away with these and rely on Windows?"" 
Liam Pearson, Portsmouth, UK
Service Pack 2 was an important update for Windows XP over two years ago, which fixed some bugs and added a significant amount of additional security features to prevent online attacks on Windows machines.
One of these is firewall software which controls how your computer connects to the internet, and stops anything coming in without your permission.
But it is pretty basic and if you are used to ZoneAlarm, carry on using it, it is one of the best free firewalls out there, although I notice that the free version is considerably more difficult to find on their website than it used to be, so here it is: www.zonealarm.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_za.jsp
Incidentally, the new version of Microsoft Windows Vista, does include a much more fully featured firewall so we will take a closer look at that, and other Vista features, in a few weeks.

Spyware is software which is loaded onto your computer without your knowledge, or possibly without the full functionality being made clear to you. It can, among other things, slow your internet connection down and make frustrating changes to your browser.
""A pop-up window on my computer told me that Errorguard found 163 critical faults on my computer. Is this organisation safe to pay $30 to fix the problems?""
Maurice Lewis, UK
I would be very cautious of any piece of software which first suggested that you had alarming sounding faults on your computer, and then tried to get you to part with $30. In some cases software which scares you into installing it can turn out to be exactly the kind of spyware they claim to protect you against!
Besides, many good anti-spyware programs are free and Liam in Portsmouth is already using a good one.
Spybot Search and Destroy is free and simple to use (www.spybot.info).

Microsoft do now have their own Anti-Spyware software which changed its name recently to Windows Defender. It is also free.
I like it. It is simple to use, and you can schedule regular scans for spyware, just like Anti-virus software, and best of all, updates are free and come automatically. But you must verify that your copy of Windows is genuine before Microsoft will let you download it (www.microsoft.com/defender).
If you have Windows XP, but not Service Pack 2, you can get it from Windows Update (http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com).
It is an enormous download, so only to be tried if you have got broadband, and it may slow your computer down a little.
However, I think the firewall protection is the most important part of the upgrade, so if you are running up to date firewall software then you might be able to do without Service Pack 2, but it really is recommended.

Warning screen

Legal action was first taken by the FTC against Mr Wallace in 2004. Under an agreement brokered between the two in 2005 Mr Wallace agreed to stop putting his advertising programs on computers.

The FTC said that the programs created by Mr Sanford and his company Smartbot.Net exploited a loophole in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to install themselves stealthily on PCs. 

One program made the computer's CD tray open and then flashed a warning up on screen saying: "" If your cd-rom drive's open . . .You DESPERATELY NEED to rid your system of spyware pop-ups IMMEDIATELY!"".

The FTC said the software was installed without user's knowledge or consent - a violation of US laws.

A judgement against Mr Wallace and Smartbot.Net orders them to hand over $4,089,500 generated by the spyware. 

It also bans Mr Wallace and Smartbot.Net from downloading software to users' machines and stops them using the tactics many spyware firms employ to get their software installed.

Now grassroots online security activists in the UK hope testimonies can raise awareness of the problem.

The number of malicious infections worldwide soared in 2005, said security firm Webroot.


In its annual report into spyware, Webroot, which develops legitimate anti-spyware software, expressed concern over the increasing sophistication of attacks.

New laws in the US allow disgruntled computer users to petition the Federal Trade Commission about unsolicited software.









People hear so many horror stories about keyloggers, phishing sites, rootkits and trojans that they pay good money for a useless program

If the FTC gathers evidence of a crime, it can - and does - launch prosecutions. Last month two companies were ordered to hand back more than $2m (£1.14m) garnered through selling fake anti-spyware products.

But in the UK, which has the highest rate of spyware infection in Europe, prosecution is more difficult.

Local Trading Standards offices can register complaints, as can regional police forces, but there remains no easy central pathway to the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit.

Part-time saviour

Gwynne Brothwood, a volunteer who works feverishly in online forums training people to remove spyware and other infections, believes the issue needs to be resolved.

""The people who push this software make life a misery for vulnerable users, not just in the UK but worldwide,"" Mrs Brothwood told the BBC News website.

Last year Mrs Brothwood was named a Most Valuable Professional by Microsoft for her security work.

She holds down a full-time job in the real world and can only work on the Malware Removal University website in her spare time.

In an effort to stir up public interest in the problem, she has helped set up an online forum for people infected with spyware, located at malwareremoval.com.

""All of a sudden people are bombarded with messages that they have spyware on their computer and that this particular program will clean them up,"" Mrs Brothwood said.

""They hear so many horror stories in the news about keyloggers, phishing sites, rootkits and trojans that will steal your personal data that they panic and part with good money to pay for a program that is little more than useless.  

""What they don't know is that the makers of this program infected them in the first place.""  

International issue

According to the latest figures from Webroot, there are more than 21 online spies for every Windows PC in the UK, the highest figure in Europe.

But the problem does not respect national borders. Other forms of so-called malware have spread further as internet use has grown.






Andrew Miller MP hopes the UK can fight back against spyware




In Poland, 867 of every 1,000 domestic PCs have been infected by trojans, unsolicited programs that can allow remote users to control the machine.

It is this international reach that concerns those in authority trying to combat the spread of spyware.

""The real problem is that there is a need to encourage active international co-operation to bring about an end to this,"" said Andrew Miller MP, who chairs of the UK Parliamentary Information Technology Committee (Pitcom).

Last year Webroot organised a high-level international conference to raise awareness of the problems.

Major developers of security software have announced plans to collaborate.

Nevertheless, for those millions who find themselves infected today, their first port of call is rarely a government agency or even a high-profile security firm like Symantec or McAfee.

Alliance

Instead worried PC owners wind up at sites run by highly-skilled volunteers like Gwynne Brothwood and her colleague Chris Davis.

Spyware Warrior, a high-profile US-based website, has become a key port of call. The site includes an exhaustive index of rogue anti-spyware programs, and key players Suzi Turner and Eric Howes have emerged as minor celebrities in the fight against spyware.

Andrew Miller MP wants UK web users to see a direct route from infection  to diagnosis, official complaint and, he hopes, possible criminal action by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit.

The government has launched a portal site for users, called Get Safe Online, but making it stand out from the welter of self-help and self-harm websites cluttering the net is a tough proposition.

Mr Miller said that the challenges of streamlining even a UK-wide fight against spyware were ""enormous"".

These extras can bombard users with unwanted adverts, slow down PCs and sometimes steal personal information.

Eventually the project hopes to make tools to help clean up infested PCs.


Name and shame

Although the numbers of computer viruses are growing every day, many makers of malicious programs have started putting their energy into creating so-called spyware and adware programs.

Some of these nuisances sneak on to PCs by exploiting loopholes in Microsoft Windows but many are simply bundled in with other programs that users do want to install.

Also some unscrupulous companies produce fake programs that claim to help users get rid of spyware or block spam but which make sure they receive only ads and spam from the software maker's partners.

The project aims to make clear what users will get when they download and install software. 

Although funded by Google, Sun and Chinese computer firm Lenovo, the research will be carried out by the Oxford Internet Institute and the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Advice will also be provided by Consumer Reports WebWatch.

""We do have companies in mind but we are not going to name names off the bat,"" said John Palfrey, co-director of the Stop Badware Coalition and director of Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet & Society.

""The key message here is that we are putting every company on notice,"" he said.

The project aims to produce its first reports in February. 

To some extent the Stop Badware project will repeat work done by some anti-spyware campaigners such as Suzi Turner and Eric Howes who maintain a list of fake products that users should be wary of.

This is a form of spyware that can subject people to pop-up adverts, hijack their homepage and install bookmarks.

553,42,spyware,ID theft spyware scam uncovered,23 August 2005,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4173218.stm,"Accounts at 50 banks are in danger of being plundered





Thousands of computer users have been caught out by a huge ID theft ring.

Security firm Sunbelt Software said it stumbled across a US-based server storing megabytes of data stolen from compromised computers while researching spyware infections.

The server held passwords for online accounts from 50 banks, Ebay and Paypal logins, hundreds of credit card numbers and reams of personal data.

The FBI has reportedly now started investigating the ring of ID thieves.


Hidden data

The bug that has stolen all the data is thought to be a variant of a family of trojans known as Dumaru or Nibu that exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.

The trojan, a malicious piece of code, automatically downloaded itself on computers when people visited sites harbouring the program. 












The way the data is laid out, the quality of it, it's very easy to go through and use it for nefarious purposes
 


Eric Sites, Sunbelt Software





    



The hidden payload in this bug is a keylogger that grabs a copy of everything a user types. 

What made this bug so effective was its ability to grab text stored on the clipboard and by Internet Explorer, said Eric Sites, vice president of research and development at Sunbelt Software.

Microsoft's browser has a feature, called AutoComplete, that automatically populates boxes on web forms where people typically fill in names, addresses, e-mail addresses, credit card numbers and other biographical details.

The feature is supposed to make filling in forms on websites less of a chore. In this case, said Mr Sites, it helped the ID thieves get hold of enormously valuable data.

Typically a keylogger produces a file containing an unbroken string of characters, said Mr Sites.

""It's usually very hard to take that and do anything with it,"" he told the BBC News website. 

By contrast, AutoComplete data is already labelled and sorted because the browser has to know where to put each item.

""The way the data is laid out, the quality of it, it's very easy to go through and use it for nefarious purposes,"" he said. ""This is about getting money and stealing.""

Megabytes of data

The BBC News website was shown the server and some of the files containing personal data that it was storing. Each file was full of login names, e-mail addresses, credit card details and everything needed to steal someone's identity or simply empty their bank account.

Analysis of information in the files revealed login details for online services at 50 banks as well as user details for many Ebay and Paypal accounts. One bank account had more than $380,000 in it. 

Sunbelt has contacted some of the people identified in the files to warn them that they have fallen victim to the bug. Banks, credit card firms, Ebay and Paypal have been told about compromised accounts. 

The server at the centre of the ID theft ring had many multi-megabyte sized files on it, said Mr Sites. The server, which was based in the US, was regularly cleaned out by the thieves who created the trojan.

Infected machines sent files back hourly or when the logs of data they were collecting had reached a certain size.

Browser danger

Mr Sites said that, so far, the trojan had been found on porn sites and websites offering cracks for pirated software. But, he said, the trojan was likely to be on many other websites as it had managed to infect so many users. 

Sunbelt believes the trojan has been circulating for about three weeks and in that time has probably infected thousands of victims.

The vulnerability it exploits means that all a user has to do to fall victim is to visit the wrong site. 

""Type in a web link and your machine is infected,"" said Mr Sites. ""You do not have to click on anything, the website forces the installation.""

Many victims may have no idea that they have been infected.

""This version of the trojan was very successful,"" he said. ""It was very small, hard to detect, the file had a very innocuous name and did not cause any problems to the machine.

The size and sophistication of the ID theft ring led anti-virus and security companies to quickly produce tools that can spot if a machine has been compromised by the server and clean up infected machines.

The trojan was tricky to spot because the files being sent back to the server were disguised as data traffic generated by a user's browser.

The potential issue could have been triggered by a video file sent from an unknown number.
WhatsApp said that it had no reason to believe users' phones were affected.
News of the new issue came soon after WhatsApp admitted that its software was used to install spyware on phones.
Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, had announced the fix for the new vulnerability in the system a few days ago.
Cert said that if users opened the video file, the software installed itself on the phone - in similar fashion to the Pegasus malware, which is believed to have been used against journalists and activists.
The agency added that the vulnerability would have allowed attackers to access phones and make changes to the device, no matter where it was geographically located.
The issue would have required requires users to open the video file, unlike the more sophisticated Pegasus which activated itself through a vulnerability in WhatsApp's video calling function and did not require the call to be answered.
The messaging app has also said it has issued a security update that should take care of the issue.

Some websites also take advantage of bugs in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to install spyware on the machines of people that visit.

The dangers of spyware are making people wary of what they do online like no other net threat, said Susannah Fox, lead author on the Pew Internet study.

""People are feeling less adventurous, less free to do whatever they want to do online,"" she said.

556,45,spyware,Coronavirus: Ultra-Orthodox Israeli town of Bnei Brak under lockdown,3 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-52149316,"An ultra-Orthodox Jewish town with one of the highest rates of coronavirus cases in Israel has been placed under effective lockdown.
Residents of Bnei Brak, just outside Tel Aviv, will only be allowed out in exceptional circumstances. Only some key workers will be allowed in.
A senior health official said almost 40% of the town probably had the virus, though his claim was refuted.
Overall, more than 7,000 Israelis have been infected and 37 have died.
Across the country, people have been told to stay within a 100-metre (330 ft) radius of their homes; public gatherings have been banned; and anyone going outdoors has been told to cover their face with a mask or scarf.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in voluntary self-isolation despite testing negative for the disease, has warned that further restrictions might be imposed to try to curb the spread of the virus.
Bnei Brak was declared a ""restricted zone"" at a cabinet meeting on Thursday night. Earlier, police set up cordons around the town to reduce the flow of traffic moving in and out.
The latest measures mean residents will only be allowed out of the town on a case-by-case basis. Non-residents - other than security forces, essential services workers and journalists - will not be allowed in.
About 4,500 elderly residents - those deemed most at risk - will be evacuated from the town and quarantined in specially designated hotels, according to the Jerusalem Post newspaper.
Soldiers from the Israeli military's Paratroopers Brigade were being deployed to help the Homefront Command, the paper said.
Bnei Brak is only second to the much larger city of Jerusalem in terms of the total number of coronavirus cases.
On Thursday, the head of the Maccabi health service used by about half the 200,000-strong population of Bnei Brak told a parliamentary committee that about 38% of residents were likely to have the virus, and that there were probably tens of thousands of cases which had not been officially confirmed.
However, Israeli media later reported that according to the Ministry of Health and Maccabi officials the figure was the result of a miscalculation.
There has been growing disquiet in Israel about the slowness of some ultra-Orthodox communities to adopt official measures to reduce the spread of the virus.
Many ultra-Orthodox live within large families in crowded neighbourhoods. Their access to the internet and social media is also limited for religious reasons, meaning news and information from the outside world is comparatively poor.
In some strictly religious communities, gatherings for prayer and celebrations including weddings have continued to take place, despite the nationwide ban.
However, two days ago Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that there had been a ""very positive shift"" in the attitude of the ultra-Orthodox towards the seriousness of the virus.

557,46,spyware,New bid to tackle spyware scourge,1 February 2006,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4669304.stm,"Five computer security firms are collaborating on a common naming system for spyware and will co-produce tools to remove the malicious software.

The initiative hopes to remove some of the current confusion caused by anti-spyware firms managing their own labelling and removal methods.

The group said collaboration was needed as the amount of spyware in circulation was rising by 50-100% per year.


Common ground

The initiative will see ICSA Labs, McAfee, Symantec, Thompson Cyber Security Labs and Trend Micro join forces to tackle spyware.

In recent years spyware has become a big problem as many hi-tech criminals, over-zealous advertisers and vandals use surreptitious techniques to sneak their software onto users' PCs.

Some of these nuisance programs get onto PCs via e-mail messages that hide the spyware in attachments but others are bundled in with popular software, such as file-sharing programs, and some install automatically if a user visits a booby-trapped website.

Some spyware is simply an unpleasant nuisance as it bombards users with pop-up adverts they did not ask for or services they would never use.

However, other spyware programs are explicitly criminal and aim to hijack home computers or steal confidential information.

The involvement of the respected ICSA Labs in the initiative is significant because for years it has tested anti-virus programs to ensure they meet basic standards for detecting and removing malicious programs. 

The group aims to emulate some of the common labelling and prevention systems of the anti-virus world. The initiative is an acknowledgement of how serious the spyware problem is becoming. The work of the group will be collected on the spywaretesting.org website.

""There is an enormous amount of confusion in the marketplace about the origins of spyware and the effectiveness of the tools designed to fight it,"" said Larry Bridwell from ICSA Labs.

At first the initiative will produce tools and information to help users identify and remove the spyware they have on their machine right now. Eventually it hopes to create programs that help prevent people falling victim to spyware.

The working agreement between the five firms comes only days after the announcement of the Stop Badware campaign set up by Google, Sun Microsystems, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, and the Oxford Internet Institute.

From 1 January, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware.  

The legislation, which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information.  

Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year.  

The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. 

At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers.  

The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate.  

Ad onslaught

One form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing.  

It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close.  

In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead.  

The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer.  

It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware.  

Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software.  

The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights.

A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs.

560,49,spyware,Tech Tent - whoâs spying on you?,17 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48309518,"It was the week when we learned that a missed WhatsApp call could plant spyware on your phone and when San Francisco moved to ban facial recognition technology.
On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move.
When WhatsApp's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it.
The firm briefed journalists that the attack had ""all the hallmarks"" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones.
It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.
The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years.
Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was ""pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company"".
He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link.
But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists.
He says the spyware is quite insidious: ""Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on.""
NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour.
The Israeli firm said in a statement: ""NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror.
""The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.""
Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO.
We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the WhatsApp hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab.
At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: ""We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible.""
Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government.
The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places.
Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: ""Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society.""
Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking.
But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: ""The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government.""
Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.",Yes
561,50,spyware,US spyware bills win large vote,25 May 2005,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4578461.stm,"The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly for two bills which clamp down on spyware programs.

The I-SPY Prevention Act of 2005 and the SPY Act introduce multi-million dollar fines and prison sentences. 

Spyware has become a big problem for computer users. They are programs that sit on a computer collecting sometimes sensitive data and net browsing habits.


The I-SPY Prevention Act of 2005 makes it an offence to access a computer without permission via spyware programs and introduces sentences of up to five years in prison for criminal activity.

The SPY Act, means firms need a user's permission before installing programs onto their computers. 

The bills would also mean harsher penalties for those behind phishing scams. 

Phishing scams are where cyber criminals direct people to spoof websites which look like official bank or e-commerce sites, hence fooling them into giving away confidential information.

The two bills now go to the Senate for further consideration.

""Consumers have a right to know and have a right to decide who has access to their highly personal information that spyware can collect,"" said Californian representative Mary Bono, who introduced one of the bills.

Although the moves are encouraging, there are still obstacles to preventing criminal use of spyware, such as lack of global enforcement policies, as well as the intricacies involved in distinguishing different types of spyware.

Slow down

Spyware programs can surreptitiously find their way onto a computer when free software is downloaded, or when certain websites are visited. They can also be picked up through some peer-to-peer networks.

Once on a computer, they can cause a nuisance by redirecting web searches, installing unwanted bookmarks or bombarding a computer user with pop-up ads tailored to other search terms. 

It can also make computers slower and crash machines. Malicious spyware can also steal confidential information, such as key stroke details which might reveal passwords. 

Spyware was highlighted recently after the criminals who tried to steal money from Sumitomo Mitsui bank used keylogging software to gather confidential data from the financial institution.

The threats on the net






    



The problem for many countries, however, is tracking down the purveyors of spyware. Only two have been sued so far in the US. 

""We know that there are literally hundreds of these cases out there,"" Ari Schwartz, associate director at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a consumer-advocacy group, told the Reuters news agency.

""Unless there's a push for enforcement, passing a new law is really only going to help after the fact.""  

From 1 January 2005, California state introduced the Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act which banned the installation of software that takes control of another computer. 

Companies and websites also have to disclose whether they will install spyware under the Act.

According to a recent survey, 90% of PCs are infested with spyware. Each computer has, on average, nearly 30 spyware programs on them. 

Computer users are urged to regularly scan their machines with more than one anti-spyware program, such as Spybot and AdAware. Webroot and Symantec produce anti-spyware programs too. 

Using a combination of anti-spyware software means one might recognise spyware that the other may have missed.",Yes
562,51,spyware,Spyware tightens grip on user PCs,9 May 2005,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4528801.stm,"If you can say one good thing about computer viruses it is that they spring up and die away quite quickly.

The well-established ways to defend yourself against them mean you can swiftly find them, fix the problem and forget about them.

Sadly, the same cannot be said of spyware - the software that can smuggle itself on to Windows computers.
Infection vector

You can catch spyware lots of ways; visit the wrong website, open the wrong spam e-mail, use the wrong peer-to-peer file sharing program, or fail to keep your PC protected with a firewall and anti-virus software.

What will happen if you do fall victim depends on the spyware writers' motives. Some programs just want to bombard you with ads. Others hijack browser settings and the most malicious steal personal details such as login names and passwords. 

Chances are that you already have some spyware on your PC. In most surveys about 90% of PCs are found to have several pieces of the surreptitious software installed. 

And spyware, unlike viruses, is designed to stay in place for a long time, said Richard Stiennon, vice president of threat research at anti-spyware firm Webroot.






Elliot Spitzer has accused firms of peddling spyware




Programs want to stay in place so that their creators can make money from them, said Mr Stiennon - again in contrast to most virus writers who tend to disdain financial gain. 

Pornographers, spammers and many dubious web enterprises are happy to pay the spyware makers to make sure their adverts reach a wide audience - almost none of whom would sign up for such marketing messages given the choice.

The amount of money being made from spyware is a good motivation. 

Webroot estimates that spyware makers are raking in up to $2bn per year. While some disagree with the size of this estimate there's no doubt that the amount of cash some spyware firms are making is significant.
Legal case

Currently spyware exists in a legal grey area, said Ben Edelman, a Harvard economics PhD student who also studies the stuff.

While there is no legislation that specifically outlaws spyware, the way that the programs get on to computers is ethically dubious.

Many innocuous looking programs such as download accelerators, smiley icon makers, peer-to-peer interfaces and other utilities also include spyware software. 

The question, said Mr Edelman, is whether users know what they are getting when they install these programs.

""The basic argument is one of user consent,"" said Mr Edelman.






Anti-spyware firms recommend that PC owners switch browsers




Many makers of spyware and adware claim they have been installed legitimately because users have to click a ""yes"" button when software bearing spyware installs. 

But, said Mr Edelman, the user agreements are often very long, sometimes more than 50 pages, and its unreasonable to expect that users read all this and know what they are getting.

""My claim is that the installations are deceptive,"" said Mr Edelman who favours a more transparent approach where users are told exactly what they are getting and what they are signing up for.

Legal action against firms that do not do enough to warn users about what they have signed up for has already begun. 

New York attorney general Elliot Spitzer has filed a lawsuit against a company called Intermix claming that it does not do enough to warn users about what they are signing up for.

For its part Intermix denies any wrongdoing and issued a statement that it did not promote or condone spyware.

For PC users keen to avoid spyware there are several remedies they can take. Firstly they should use anti-spyware programs regularly to keep PCs free of the programs.

Spybot and AdAware are the most popular anti-spyware programs but Webroot, Microsoft and Symantec all produce them too.

Secondly, if they use Microsoft's Internet Explorer, they should make sure it is up-to-date with patches, and that pop-up blockers are turned on. It might also be worth using an alternative browser such as Opera or Firefox that do not have as many security problems as IE.",Yes
563,52,spyware,US seeks to fine spyware makers,7 October 2004,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3721262.stm,"US legislators have overwhelmingly backed a proposal to impose penalties on the creators of so-called ""spyware"".

These programs gather information about browsing habits, passwords and credit card details and some even turn home computers into spam relays.

Later this month a second spyware bill is being debated that criminalises secret spyware installations.

Jail sentence
The US Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act (aka Spy Act) was passed 399-1 in the House of Representatives.

The dissenting voter was Representative Ron Paul from Texas who believes the government should not police the net.

The Spy Act aims to impose civil penalties when spyware is smuggled on to a PC without an owner's knowledge or consent. Those found guilty could face a fine of up to $3m.

The measure demands that any maker of a spyware program gets permission from a user to install itself and gets their agreement about what kinds of information can be collected.

However, it does nothing to tackle spy programs that watch the keys being press and steal personal information because existing US laws already criminalise this behaviour.






US politicians have three chances to show how they feel about spyware





	
Spying software exempt from the provisions in the Spy Act include programs used by the FBI and other law enforcement organisations to gather data on suspects.

There are another two anti-spyware bills making their way through the US legislative system.

The Internet Spyware Prevention Act (aka I Spy Act), proposes jail sentences for those who hide installations of spyware and the gather personal information without permission.

House members are expected to try to combine the two bills into one later this month to avoid a lengthy debate later in the year that could delay the adoption of anti-spyware laws.

Also pending is the Software Principles Yielding Better Levels of Consumer Knowledge Act (aka Spy Block Act) is backed by the Senate and also outlaws the surreptitious installation of software to spy on computer users. There is no date set for a vote on this bill.

Critics said these bills would make little difference to the amount of spyware in circulation and cited the US Can-Spam Act which has, so far, done little to curb the amount of junk mail people are being sent.

A survey by US net provider Earthlink has found that, on average, a net-connected PC is home to 26 spyware programs.

To gather its raw data, Earthlink scanned more than three million machines over the last nine months and found more than 83 million spyware programs during its trawl.

Spyware is a broad term for software that hides on a PC, collecting data about you and what you do on the net.

The proposed measures could become law later this year, according to one of the panel members.

PC hijack

Spyware is widely seen by many as a nuisance.  It is often downloaded onto your PC when you download other free software.

The US bill was introduced by California Republican Mary Bono and New York Democrat Ed Towns. It is one of several bills before Congress in response to growing concerns about spyware.

It has now passed a significant hurdle in the race to become law, winning the backing of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. 

""We continue to meet people who have had their web pages hijacked, their browsers corrupted, and in some cases their children exposed to inappropriate material via nefarious programs lurking on their hard drives,"" said subcommittee
chairman Cliff Stearns.

Infested machines

The proposed law would force software makers to alert people before loading programs on a computer.  It would also require that spyware could be easily removed.

But some fear that the spyware bill could inadvertently lead to problems for sellers of legitimate software.

A recent survey by the US internet provider Earthlink found that the average computer was packed with hidden software.

It uncovered an average of 28 spyware programs on each PC scanned during the first three months of the year.

565,54,spyware,Pegasus: India may cite WhatsApp breach to store data locally,28 November 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-50582728,"Indian officials are likely to cite the WhatsApp snooping controversy to push through a plan to compel digital companies to store data of Indian users locally, multiple reports say.Â
Tech experts confirmed that multiple government departments and agencies have proposed such demands.
It was ""a serious issue of national security"", and ""requires measures, including data localisation"", officials were quoted as saying.
Experts called it a ""bizarre response"".
""This makes no sense at all. The location of the data had nothing to do with the Pegasus breach,"" technology expert Prasanto K Roy told the BBC.
""WhatsApp was very transparent about the breach and reported it to the authorities. What is important now, is to find out who did it and how.""
""Data localisation completely goes against the whole concept of the internet which is a global network,"" he added.
Reports have quoted government officials as saying that they wanted user data stored locally as the Pegasus breach ""compromised national security"".
Hackers were able to install surveillance software on phones and other devices by using a major vulnerability in the messaging app.
Targets received video or voice call requests from an unknown number - which even if ignored, allowed the spyware, known as Pegasus, to be installed on the device.
This allowed users to remotely access everything on the phone, including text messages and location.
WhatsApp fixed the vulnerability as soon as it was discovered and informed affected users.
It also filed a lawsuit against Israeli firm NSO Group, alleging it was behind the cyber-attacks that infected devices in April and May.
NSO Group, which makes software for surveillance, says it only works with government agencies and strongly denied responsibility for the attacks.
Activists and politicians pointed fingers at the state after WhatsApp revealed Indian journalists and activists were among those targeted.
The government has denied the claims.
However, it has also repeatedly refused to discuss the issue in parliament.
It refused to answer questions about who had authorised the attacks and instead cited a controversial law that specified the right of agencies to monitor and decrypt information in national security interest.
It also tried to stop a parliamentary committee on cyber security from discussing the matter, saying it did not fall under the purview of the panel.",Yes
566,55,spyware,Stalkerware: The software that spies on your partner,25 October 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50166147,"Amy says it all started when her husband seemed to know intimate details about her friends.
""He would drop snippets into conversations, such as knowing about Sarah's baby. Really private things that he shouldn't have known about. If I asked how he knew these things, he'd say I'd told him and accuse me of losing it,"" she says.
Amy - not her real name - also began to wonder how he seemed to know where she was all the time.
""Sometimes he would say he saw me at a cafe where I was meeting my friends and say he was just passing by chance. I started to question everything and trust no-one, even my friends,"" she says.
For months, these incidents built up, turning an abusive marriage into a nightmare that came to a chilling conclusion after a Halloween family trip.
""We'd been to visit a pumpkin patch and were having a rare good weekend, which basically means my husband hadn't taken anything out on me. Our six-year-old son was playing on the floor and was so happy,"" Amy says.
""My husband passed me his phone to show me a picture he'd taken at the farm and in that split-second I saw an alert pop up on his screen. It read, 'Daily report on Amy's Mac is ready to view.'
""I felt this chill go through me and I stopped breathing for a minute. I had to excuse myself and pretended I needed the bathroom. I had to be there for my son and pretend that I hadn't seen anything.
""The first moment I could, I went to the library to use the computer and look up the spyware he'd used. That's when everything made sense after months of thinking I was going crazy.""
Stalkerware - also known as spouseware - are powerful surveillance software programs typically sold openly online.
On a device, all messages can be read, screen activity recorded, GPS locations tracked and cameras used to spy on what an individual is doing.
According to cyber-security company Kaspersky, the number of people who have discovered such software on their devices has risen by at least 35% in the past year.
Kaspersky researchers say their protection technologies have detected stalkerware on 37,532 devices so far this year.
And principal security researcher David Emm says this is the ""tip of a very large iceberg"".
""Most people will routinely protect a laptop or desktop, not that many people actually protect a mobile device,"" he says.
""This information is coming back from installations of our product on [smartphones]... so this figure doesn't even go close to what the total would be.""
Kaspersky's findings indicate Russia is the country with the highest levels of stalkerware activity. India, Brazil, the United States and Germany complete the top five, with the UK in eighth place with 730 detections.
Another security company says there are practical steps people can take if they suspect they are already being spied on.
""It's always advisable to check which apps are on your phone and conduct a virus scan where necessary and if there are any apps on your device that you do not recognise it is worth searching online for reviews and deleting them,"" says Jake Moore, from Eset.
""As a general rule, if you aren't using an app, delete it.""
Once Amy realised her computer had been compromised, she developed a severe mistrust of technology, which she is only just overcoming.
Charities say this is a common psychological response to such a trauma.
Jessica was another victim of stalkerware. Her ex-husband routinely spied on her through her phone's microphone and would play mind games by repeating specific phrases she and her friends had used in private conversations.
It's been years since she escaped the relationship but she still leaves her phone locked in the car when seeing friends.
Gemma Toynton, from domestic abuse charity Safer Places, says she see this long-term effect a lot in her cases.
""It reduces someone's trust,"" she says. ""It makes them see a phone or laptop as a weapon, because that's what it's been used for.
""Technology has become, in their minds like a net around them and a lot of people do withdraw from using the internet.
""It really does impact your whole life. The fact that this stalkerware is on the rise is a real concern.""
Amy, who is from the US, is now divorced and lives many miles away from her ex-husband.
She has a restraining order preventing him from direct contact with her and he is legally allowed to communicate logistics about their son's care via written letter only.
I tested out one of the most popular consumer products, which costs Â£140 for three months of surveillance.
I bought it online and installed it on to my work phone. It took me about an hour and I used the 24-hour live support offered by the company when I encountered any problems.
Spyware companies advertise their services as ""employee monitoring"" or ""parental control"" products.
In many countries, including the UK, using the spyware on a spouse without their permission is illegal, so many of the companies' websites are littered with disclaimers advising against this.
However, some of the same websites link to articles, seemingly written by associates, recommending the software as a spy tool for ""cheatings wives and husbands"".
In a live chat with the company whose product I was testing, I directly told them: ""I want to install this on my wife's phone, will it be secret?""
The customer service-representative responded: ""The application will start to work in stealth mode right after installation. I'll be happy to help.""
I also downloaded five of the top cyber-security products on to the infected mobile and carried out a free scan.
All of them gave alerts for ""potentially harmful software"".
The Crown Prosecution Service says there aren't specific laws related to the use of stalkerware but any criminal activity like this can be prosecuted by a number of means including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.
Amy says more should be done to legislate against the use of these technologies.
""They need to stop hiding behind plausible deniability,"" she says.
""There is a wink that's given when they send this little disclaimer that says, 'We don't approve of you spying on wives.' They know what their customers are doing though. This software causes real harm.""",Yes

Panorama broadcast hacked footage from inside the call centre which showed how staff charged people hundreds of pounds to fix non-existent computer problems.
The owner of the call centre, Amit Chauhan, denied it was a scam but declined to answer detailed questions.
Mr Chauhan is now in custody after police raided the call centre.
It was located in the Gurugram suburb of Delhi, and Mr Chauhan is due to appear in court on Thursday.
The programme had also obtained the recordings of 70,000 calls where victims were being ripped off in the UK, America and Australia.
Indian police are appealing for British residents who paid money to the call centre to contact them by email at Shocybergrg.pol-hry@gov.in
Perry Adams was one of those who lost money after a bogus warning appeared on his computer, saying it had been infected with pornographic spyware.
He said he will be contacting the Indian police with his evidence.
""I think that it's superb the work that Panorama has done on behalf of the victims, to catch someone who thought they were untouchable. There's nothing to stop him opening up somewhere else, so I'll be interested to see what happens in court,"" he said.
Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in legitimate call centres in India, but there are also dozens of call centres running scams.
Indian police say it is a difficult crime to prosecute because all of the victims are overseas, and they need evidence from victims in order to bring charges.

568,57,spyware,WhatsApp to stop working on millions of phones,31 January 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51329882,"Messaging service WhatsApp will no longer work on millions of smartphones from 1 February.
Android and iPhone devices which only support outdated operating systems will no longer be able to run the Facebook-owned app.
WhatsApp said the move was necessary in order to protect the security of its users.
Smartphones using Android 2.3.7 and older, and iPhone iOS 8 or older, are those affected by the update.
The operating systems that WhatsApp is dropping support for are legacy operating systems, which are no longer updated or installed on new devices.
Most users will simply be able to update their operating systems in order to continue using the messaging service.
However, certain devices, such as the iPhone 4, which only supports iOS 7, will no longer be compatible with the app.
""WhatsApp clearly had no option but to ensure its service remains secure, however it faces the difficult side-effect that the app is no longer compatible with older smartphones,"" said CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood.
""This is likely to disproportionally impact the long-tail of its users, particularly in growth markets where there is a high proportion of older devices.""
WhatsApp, which was one of the most-downloaded apps of the decade, first warned users that these changes would happen back in 2017.
""This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp,"" said a spokesperson for the company.

India has also asked WhatsApp for a detailed explanation, Information and Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a statement on Twitter.
NSO Group has also denied the allegations against them.
""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute the allegations and vigorously fight them,"" NSO Group said in a statement to the BBC.

""While I cannot reveal their identities and the exact number, I can say that it is not an insignificant number,"" WhatsApp spokesperson Carl Woog told The Indian Express newspaper.
Indian news site Scroll says it has confirmed that at least 17 individuals, including activists, scholars and journalists, were affected by the breach.
""The profile of the private Indian citizens targeted in this case suggests the involvement of state agencies in India,"" technology writer Prasanto K Roy told the BBC. ""These people are all activists, journalists and lawyers who work with or represent tribal people and dalits (formerly untouchables) in sensitive areas where people have clashed with the state.""
Mr Roy added that the list of people targeted so far is very specific. ""I can't think of a single foreign government, not even Pakistan, who would be interested in these particular private citizens.""
Lawyer Nihalsing Rathod, who has defended human rights activists arrested after caste-based violence broke out in the western state of Maharashtra in August 2018, told BBC Marathi that his phone had been targeted.
The arrests of the activists had been sharply criticised by many as a ""witch hunt"" against those who challenged the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Another of those targeted  is Bela Bhatia, a writer and human rights lawyer who has alleged constant harassment by police in the volatile central state of Chhattisgarh.
With 400 million users, India is the biggest market for the Facebook-owned company.
However, it is not the first time that the messaging platform has found itself in trouble with local authorities.
A spate of lynchings driven by rumours of child kidnappings circulating on WhatsApp prompted Indian authorities to demand that the company do something to curb the spread of misinformation on its platform.
WhatsApp then took several steps, including advertising in newspapers and limiting the number of forwards a single user could send to five.
It also marked messages that had been forwarded with a label.
Since then, the government has gone a step further by saying that it would introduce new rules in January 2020 that would allow it to monitor, intercept and trace social media messages. In response, WhatsApp has said this would not be possible, ""given the end-to-end encryption"" the app uses.
Soon after it discovered the cyber-attacks in May, the company rolled out a fix, adding ""new protections"" to their systems and issuing updates.
Cyber-experts at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab helped WhatsApp identify more than 100 cases of ""abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe, ranging from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America"".

570,59,spyware,"Tech tales of love, sex and online abuse in India",7 October 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-54275986,"Years ago, when Indian artist Indu Harikumar fell in love, she thought it was the perfect romance.
But within months, the live-in relationship began to unravel - there were frequent fights, mostly over what she was posting on the internet.
""I had no idea what would trigger him. Whenever I would share a photo or a selfie on social media, he would get upset about who's liking my photo, who's commenting on it,"" Ms Harikumar told the BBC.
Since she didn't want to make him angry, she trimmed her friends' list, unfriended her exes and restricted access to male friends.
""Even when he was not present, I was thinking for him - before putting a post, I was trying to anticipate how he would react? Soon, I was putting the same restrictions on my life offline too. I was walking on eggshells.""
But that didn't help - he still found things to get angry about.
""One day, he got upset by a random tweet that someone had put out saying 'I'll do anything for a person with a nose stud'. A friend with a sizeable number of followers tagged me and commented, 'Then you should look at Indu.'
""I had not seen the tweet, but my partner sent me a message saying 'you have pimps in high places',"" she says, adding that it was not the only abuse she'd faced online.
Ms Harikumar's latest crowd-sourced Instagram art project - LoveSexandTech - draws from her own personal experiences and those of other women of ""online abuse"". It's supported by Take Back the Tech, a global campaign to make digital space safer for women.
Online abuse is pervasive globally and a lot of it is directed at women. They are trolled for their politics or opinions, many often complain of receiving threats of rapes and sexual assault.
In 2017, Amnesty International polled 4,000 women from eight countries and found that 76% of women who were abused on social media restricted their use - 32% said they had stopped expressing opinions on some issues. In India too, the report said, that increasing access to the internet had resulted in more women facing online abuse for participating in public life and sharing their opinions on social media platforms.
Campaigners say online abuse has the power to ""belittle, demean, intimidate and eventually silence women"".
But the nameless, faceless trolls are one thing, a much bigger problem is how does one deal with abuse from their loved ones?
That is what LoveSexandTech is documenting - how gender-based violence in intimate relationships leads to a shrinkage of the space women occupy online.
Ms Harikumar says when she first put out a post in August asking women to share their stories about ""restrictions, surveillance and control placed by intimate partners"", she didn't think she would get many responses.
She initially called her project Love, Sex and Violence but then ""I realised that in India, a lot of violations are not even considered violence, especially the emotional ones"".
So, she spelt it out in greater details, explaining that ""this could be anything from the threat to make a chat you shared with them public or with friends, threatening to leak your nude photos or leaking them, causing you emotional, physical or sexual harm for talking to someone online or posting something that they don't approve of, or adding spyware to your devices"".
Within days, Ms Harikumar says, lots of women responded with their stories of having faced ""gaslighting, control, slut-shaming, emotional violence and manipulation"".
""I didn't think I'd get such a lot of stories,"" she says, adding that many women said they had suppressed their trauma for long and found that sharing their stories was ""cathartic"". At the same time, they wanted their stories to serve as a warning to others who found themselves in a similar situation.
One woman, who wrote in saying she was ""very conscious of her body"", spoke about her shock on finding out that her lover had shared her nude photo online without her consent.
""Three weeks after he'd shared it, he showed it to me saying 'hope you take it in the right spirit'. He was pleased that so many men said they desired me sexually.
""He said, 'These men can only desire you, but I alone can have you.' I called him a pervert. He said he did it because he wanted me to feel good about my body. But I felt so violated.""
Another wrote in saying she stopped posting selfies because every time she posted one, her boyfriend would berate her, telling her it was her way of seeking validation.
Yet another said her partner badgered her until she shared her email password with him saying ""you're hiding something or you're talking to other men"".
And another woman said her partner used her thumb to unlock her phone as she slept and later shamed her over a video she had watched online.
Almost all the women, Ms Harikumar says, narrated experiences similar to her own - that in an attempt to make their relationship work, they'd stopped talking to their exes, deleted them from their friends' list, and stopped posting selfies. They had also removed photos showing cleavage, or where they were smoking or drinking.
""They were deleting their history in an attempt to appear good. Most women take refuge in the 'good girl narrative'. It's universal - it keeps them safe. We are told women can only be of two kinds - Mother Mary or a slut.
""So, we think if we are good, things will pan out okay. We often blame ourselves when things go wrong.""
But what is heartening, she says, is that the women who ""sent in their stories said they'd realised that they were being abused and stood up to their abusers"".
One woman wrote in about how she stood up to her ex-boyfriend when he threatened to send her photos to her dad. ""I'll tell him your daughter is a slut,"" he said.
Another said her ex-boyfriend threatened to share her nudes online when she broke up with him. He backed down when she threatened to call the police on him.

571,60,spyware,"With UAE deal, Israel opens tentative new chapter with Gulf Arabs",18 August 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-53805828,"""Historic""; ""A breakthrough""; ""A game-changer""; ""A betrayal"": there is no shortage of epithets for this month's sudden announcement - by President Trump - that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is to fully normalise its relations with Israel.
After Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in 1979, followed by Jordan's in 1994, this makes the UAE only the third Arab country to normalise relations. It is the first of the six Arab Gulf states to do so. Oman. Bahrain and possibly Morocco are widely expected to follow.
Discreet contacts between the UAE and Israel had been under way for years but still, the details and timing of this normalisation deal were kept secret right up to the last minute.
There were no consultations between the UAE foreign ministry in Abu Dhabi and its Arab neighbours. Almost everyone was taken by surprise, most of all the Palestinians, who called it ""a stab in the back"" since they have yet to come close to getting a state of their own or ending Israeli occupation.
""For the Palestinians, there is zero upside here,"" comments Emile Hokayem from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
For the UAE's de facto ruler Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed (known as MBZ), this deal is something of a gamble but one with the odds heavily in his favour.
The risk is it could make the UAE leadership highly unpopular in the wider Arab world where some social media postings have been calling it ""a sell-out"". Were the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to renege on his promise to temporarily shelve annexation of parts of the West Bank then that would be extremely embarrassing for the Emiratis and possibly see the whole deal unravel.
But such a move would also draw disapproval from the White House and besides, popular street protests are not usually tolerated in the Gulf.
""In the short term, the pitfalls for the UAE are very limited,"" says Mr Hokayem. ""This deal is not going to affect the UAE regime's stability. It reflects the changing geopolitics of the region and it buys the UAE a lot of goodwill in the US, where its image has been tarnished by its involvement in the Yemen war.""
So what is behind this deal and what's in it for this relatively young Gulf nation and former British protectorate that only became a sovereign nation in 1971?
In short, it is two things - strategic advantage and technology.
The UAE, along with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, has a deep mistrust, even a fear, of its giant, heavily-armed neighbour across the water: Iran.
Gulf Arab leaders look at the map of the region and they note how, despite crippling sanctions, Iran's strategic presence has advanced rapidly across the Middle East ever since the bulwark of Saddam Hussein's regime was removed in Iraq.
Where once Iran was largely confined to its national borders, today it has proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Israel shares this concern, especially when it comes to Iran's secretive nuclear programme.
Then there is what is known as ""Islamism"" or ""political Islam"", a transnational concept often embodied by the Muslim Brotherhood and one which certain Gulf Arab rulers view as an existential threat to their dynastic monarchies. No-one dislikes the Muslim Brotherhood more fervently than the UAE crown prince and this has led to the UAE backing anti-Muslim Brotherhood factions as far away as Libya while seeing its interests clash increasingly with those of Turkey's Islamist government.
In practice, this has led to the formation of an unofficial partnership of conservative Middle Eastern governments, a de facto club to which Israel, with its formidable intelligence capabilities, is now being admitted as an associate member.
And there is technology, including biotech, healthcare, defence and cyber surveillance. Here, the UAE already has form, having purchased Israeli-manufactured spyware some years ago to keep an eye on its own citizens. The UAE has deep pockets - it has vast oil reserves and a per capita GDP of nearly $40,000 (Â£30,000). It also has ambitions globally, and beyond, having just become the first Arab country to send a mission to Mars.
Israel is by far the most technologically advanced country in the Middle East, with cutting-edge inventions. If this alliance works out it could propel the UAE to a new level of prosperity and international prestige, while safeguarding future jobs for its citizens.
Israel's overtures to the Gulf go back some way. In 1995, shortly before Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist, he sent his Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on an official visit to Oman and Qatar. Low-key Israeli trade offices then opened up in both countries' capitals. I remember calling up their office in Muscat for a comment - the Israeli representative inadvertently answered the phone with the Hebrew greeting ""Shalom"" before quickly changing it to the Arabic ""Salaamu aleikum"".
The trade initiative withered away after Mr Netanyahu became prime minister, Israel intervened in Lebanon and the second Palestinian intifada erupted. But more recently quiet diplomacy between Israel and the Gulf states has accelerated as a fear of Iranian expansionism has become the prime preoccupation.
Bahrain, Oman and Qatar may well follow the UAE if this month's announcement passes without major incident.
Saudi Arabia may take longer. But back in 2002 it was the Saudis who launched the Crown Prince Abdullah Peace Plan at the Beirut Arab summit, offering Israel full recognition in exchange for a return to its pre-1967 borders.
The deal briefly put Israeli PM Ariel Sharon on the spot but days later Hamas carried out bombings and all talks were off. Today the Middle East is a very different place and what was then unthinkable is now a reality.
""Guess what were the most searched-for words online in the UAE immediately after the deal was announced?"" said an Emirati official. ""It was 'hotels in Israel'. A lot of people can't wait to visit!""",Yes
572,61,spyware,Adobe patches Flash bug used for planting spying tools,17 October 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41652970,"Adobe has patched a new Flash security flaw that was being used by attackers to install spying tools on victims' computers.
The security bug was delivered using malicious Flash files embedded in Microsoft Word documents, sent as an email attachment to targets.
When the document was opened, the FinSpy malware would secretly install itself.
The vulnerability was discovered by Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab.
The flaw was discovered by Kaspersky Lab researchers on 10 October.
They found that the attacker - thought to be a group called BlackOasis - was targeting the governments of various countries who are members of the United Nations, as well as oil and gas companies in several regions.
In the UK, activists and several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were targeted by the attackers, but not government agencies.
Kaspersky contacted Adobe on the same day it discovered the exploit, and Adobe published the patch on Monday 16 October.
FinSpy is a surveillance software product developed by Anglo-German firm Gamma International.
It is a legal spying tool that is used by law enforcement agencies around the world for lawful surveillance during criminal and anti-terror investigations.
""What is unusual about BlackOasis is that they are using legal surveillance tools to hit other nation states,"" Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky's Global Research & Analysis Team told the BBC.
""This is unusual because everybody was using these tools for lawful surveillance in their own countries.""
Due to the numerous security issues relating to Adobe Flash, the software is now gradually being phased out.
However, some older websites still use it, so web browsers now come with protections to prevent attackers from exploiting Flash to sneakily install malware on consumers' computers.
This has proved effective in curtailing Flash exploits in the web browser, so to make the attack work, BlackOasis appeared to have embedded a Flash file in a Microsoft Word document, because this stops the typical protections from working.
Mr Raiu thinks that Microsoft should consider blocking certain types of files from launching when Word documents are opened.
He recommended that consumers install the patch for Flash even if they don't think they are using it on their computers, because it might still be installed.
""The most worrying thing in this story is that tools produced by these companies specialising in lawful surveillance are being used to fuel cross-country espionage and contribute to the increasing climate of world cyber war,"" said Mr Raiu.
""The creator of the tool is a UK company, and then it is used to spy on British targets. I just find the whole concept a bit worrying.""",Yes
573,62,spyware,"Ban on Chinese apps, including TikTok, surprises India content makers",30 June 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-53232486,"India's ban on 59 Chinese apps, including the wildly popular TikTok and WeChat platforms, has left millions of users surprised and disappointed.
The government in Delhi said the apps were ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"".
TikTok denied sharing any data with the Chinese government. Beijing said it was ""strongly concerned"" about the ban.
Experts describe the ban as a political move amid rising bilateral tensions.
Anti-China sentiment has been high in India since the clashes earlier this month at the disputed border between the two nuclear-armed neighbours left 20 Indian troops dead.
China gave no details on whether there were any Chinese casualties.
The fighting occurred in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, where both countries have increased deployment close to the disputed border.
Calls to boycott Chinese goods soon emerged, and the government issued directives to cancel or limit Chinese contracts with public sector companies.
But the ban on the apps took many by surprise. The list includes the microblogging platform Weibo, the strategy game Clash of Kings, Alibaba's UC Browser, and e-commerce apps Club Factory and Shein.
The app makers have said they are in talks with the Indian government, while Beijing has asked India to reconsider its decision.
""We want to stress that Chinese government always asks Chinese businesses to abide by international and local laws-regulations. Indian government has a responsibility to uphold the legal rights of international investors including Chinese ones,"" ANI news agency quotes Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian as saying.
India's Ministry of Information Technology has said the ban was the result of ""many complaints from various sources"" about apps that were ""stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner"".
Many of the Chinese apps have been linked to controversies over data privacy, and have been accused of sharing sensitive information with the Chinese government. US senators have even called for an investigation into TikTok, which fiercely rejects such claims.
The Indian government said in its statement that, ""the compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures"".
This isn't the first time Chinese apps have been banned in India. In 2017, Alibaba's UC Browser came under scrutiny for allegedly leaking mobile data of Indian users. And that year, India's defence ministry asked all armed personnel and officers to uninstall 42 Chinese apps it classified as ""spyware"", according to media reports.
Some, however, believe that the timing of the ban - amid escalating tensions - is not coincidental, but rather a response to the events at the border.
""This is a purely political move,"" Nikhil Pahwa, the editor of MediaNama, a media watchdog, told the BBC.
""I don't think it will affect the apps - maybe the number of the users [will drop] but it will only have a minor impact on [their] revenue,"" Mr Pahwa said.
The ban is already affecting millions of users across India, who are unable to use the blacklisted apps.
""As China has shown, governments can indeed block apps - not just remove them from the app stores, which has already happened in India, so you can't install them afresh or upgrade an existing install,"" says tech policy expert Prasanto K Roy.
He adds that although there are ways to get around the ban, it will ""effectively kill"" popular apps.
""If over 95% of 100 million users exit, that kills the 'network effect' and most of the content, and hence an app like TikTok is no longer attractive.""
India is TikTok's biggest foreign market, with an estimated 120 million active users. TikTok allows users to publish and share short videos.
In the years since it has launched in India, the app has become a platform for Indians of all ages and classes - from police constables to housewives - who  dance, sing and perform for their followers. The app has turned many ordinary Indians into social media stars.
And Mr Roy says the ban will hurt all Indians who were making money and business connections through these apps.
""The thousands of TikTok influencers who were making a living off the platform and the many Indian traders and businessmen who need to connect to people in China and do that over WeChat âthis cuts them off.""
He agrees that there is cause for concern around how the apps treat user data, but he says the response should be in the form of a privacy law, which India doesn't have.
""It's a soft strike at the Chinese, payback for the claimed border violations and recent violent conflict,"" he adds.
TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, told the BBC, it is ""committed to working with the [Indian] government to demonstrate our dedication to user security and our commitment to the country overall.
Nikhil Gandhi, TikTok's India head, said on Twitter that the company had been invited to meet ""concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications.""
Other app makers are yet to respond to the ban. Experts say that most of these firms will try to lobby policy makers but they are not likely to be allowed as long as tensions continue at the border and anti-China sentiments remain high in the country.",Yes

The hackers remotely installed surveillance software onto phones and other devices using a 'major vulnerability' or 'weakness' in the system.
The app which is owned by Facebook, said the hack targeted a ""select number of users"".
The attack was first discovered earlier this month.
The hackers were able to install the surveillance software by ringing the device.
A report by the newspaper the Financial Times found that even if the call was not picked up the surveillance software could be installed.

The Financial Times said, the spyware was developed by NSO Group, an Israeli cybersecurity and intelligence company.
NSO Group has a software called Pegasus which can collect data from a target device, such as a smartphone. The company has sold the software to governments around the world.
The human rights group Amnesty International wants to stop the company from operating.
The company told the paper: ""Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

575,64,spyware,WhatsApp discovers 'targeted' surveillance attack,14 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48262681,"Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices using a major vulnerability in messaging app WhatsApp, it has been confirmed.
WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, said the attack targeted a ""select number"" of users and was orchestrated by ""an advanced cyber-actor"".
A fix was rolled out on Friday.
On Monday, WhatsApp urged all of its 1.5 billion users to update their apps as an added precaution.
The surveillance software involved was developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, according to a report in the Financial Times.
Facebook first discovered the flaw in WhatsApp earlier in May.
WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device.
However, the surveillance software would have let an attacker read the messages on the target's device.
Some users of the app have questioned why the app store notes associated with the latest update are not explicit about the fix.
""Journalists, lawyers, activists and human rights defenders"" are most likely to have been targeted, said Ahmed Zidan from the non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists.
Android
iOS
It involved attackers using WhatsApp's voice calling function to ring a target's device.
Even if the call was not picked up, the surveillance software could be installed. According to the FT report, the call would often disappear from the device's call log.
WhatsApp told the BBC its security team was the first to identify the flaw. It shared that information with human rights groups, selected security vendors and the US Department of Justice earlier this month.
""The attack has all the hallmarks of a private company reportedly that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,â the company said on Monday in a briefing document note for journalists.
The firm also published an advisory to security specialists, in which it described the flaw as: ""A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP [voice over internet protocol] stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP [secure real-time transport protocol] packets sent to a target phone number.â
Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said it was a ""pretty old-fashioned"" method of attack.
""A buffer overflow is where a program runs into memory it should not have access to.  It overflows the memory it should have and hence has access to memory in which malicious code can potentially be run,"" he explained.
""If you are able to pass some code through the app, you can run your own code in that area.
""In VOIP there is an initial process that dials up and establishes the call, and the flaw was in that bit. Consequently you did not need to answer the call for the attack to work.""
The NSO Group is an Israeli company that has been referred to in the past as a ""cyber-arms dealer"".
While some cyber-security companies report the flaws they find so that they can be fixed, others keep problems to themselves so they can be exploited or sold to law enforcement.
The NSO Group is part-owned by the London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital, which acquired a stake in February.
NSO's flagship software, Pegasus, has the ability to collect intimate data from a target device, including capturing data through the microphone and camera, and gathering location data.
In a statement, the group said: ""NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror.
""The company does not operate the system, and after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions. We investigate any credible allegations of misuse and if necessary, we take action, including shutting down the system.
""Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. NSO would not or could not use its technology in its own right to target any person or organisation.""
WhatsApp said it was too early to know how many users had been affected by the vulnerability, although it added that suspected attacks were highly-targeted.
According to the New York Times, one of the people targeted was a London-based lawyer involved in a lawsuit against the NSO Group.
Amnesty International, which said it had been targeted by tools created by the NSO Group in the past, said this attack was one human rights groups had long feared was possible.
""They're able to infect your phone without you actually taking an action,"" said Danna Ingleton, deputy programme director for Amnesty Tech. She said there was mounting evidence that the tools were being used by regimes to keep prominent activists and journalists under surveillance.
""There needs to be some accountability for this, it can't just continue to be a wild west, secretive industry.""
On Tuesday, a Tel Aviv court will hear a petition led by Amnesty International that calls for Israel's Ministry of Defence to revoke the NSO Group's licence to export its products.
""Using an app as an attack route is limited on iOS as they run apps in very tightly controlled sandboxes,"" said Prof Woodward. ""We're all assuming that the attack was just a corruption of WhatsApp but analysis is still ongoing.
""The nightmare scenario would be if you could get something much more capable onto the device without the user having to do anything,"" he said.
The BBC has asked WhatsApp for clarification.

He said there was ""nothing more false"" than to suggest his government was behind the installation of spyware.
Several alleged victims have filed a criminal complaint following reports that the Israeli-made spyware had been found on their mobile phones.
Mexican prosecutors have opened an investigation.
A report in the New York Times said lawyers, journalists and activists investigating corruption and human rights abuses in Mexico were targeted with spyware that can infiltrate smartphones and monitor calls, texts and other communications.
The software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists.
An internet watchdog at the University of Toronto said it had found more than 76 fake messages sent to Mexican journalists and lawyers which contained links to the NSO Group's spyware.
Speaking at an event in the state of Jalisco, Mr PeÃ±a Nieto said those accusing his administration had to produce more evidence.
""This government categorically rejects any type of intervention in the private life of any citizen,"" he said.
""None of the people who feel aggrieved can affirm, demonstrate or show evidence that their life has been affected by these supposed interventions and by this alleged espionage.""
On Wednesday, the Mexican attorney general's office said prosecutors would investigate the origin of the fake messages as well as the supplier of the spyware.

577,66,spyware,Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi murder suspect had spy training,19 October 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45918610,"The BBC has uncovered new details about one of the men accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist who was critical of his country's government.
Turkish media identified Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb as being part of a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents who flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance from the city's Saudi consulate on 2 October.
He is said to have spent two years working in London, with a source describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence to US news network CNN.
And now BBC Arabic can reveal he was trained how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state.
The source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, has visually confirmed his identity from pictures circulated in the media in the days since Mr Khashoggi's disappearance.
According to him, Mr Mutreb was introduced as ""an intelligence security operative"". The spyware trainers, however, nicknamed him ""dark face"".
""Because he looked always grumpy, like he was on the sad sideâ¦ he was very silent,"" the source added.
Saudi Arabia denies any knowledge of what happened to Mr Khashoggi, insisting he left the consulate soon after getting routine paperwork.
The European surveillance expert described how Mr Mutreb spent two weeks on a course with him in 2011, learning how to use the technology his company was providing the Saudi government so that it could carry out targeted attacks on the phones and computers of its own citizens.
""The training involved things like infecting a computer from potential targets of interest for intelligence and extracting information, so digital evidence, information about this person of interest.
""This information might have been basically everything from [their] GPS position, conversation, microphone audio around the device itself, camera pictures, files on disk, emails, contacts, everything that was on the device itself.""
During the training, which was in a military compound in the suburbs of Riyadh, the surveillance expert says Mr Mutreb ""used to come and go"" and ""almost didn't speak at all"".
""He wasn't one of the guys who was particularly skilled on the technical side,"" the spyware trainer explained.
""The group was split between those doing physical intelligenceâ¦ so cameras, microphones etc, and another group of people that were doing digital surveillanceâ¦ I believe that this guy was more on the physical surveillance than the digital surveillance.""
The tools he was trained in, the source said, were similar to other tools which, according to Citizenlab and Amnesty International, were recently used against several of Mr Khashoggi's friends.
Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London. A document published by the British government in 2007 listed a man with that name as first secretary.
However, he has also been named as a Saudi intelligence officer by several individuals, and some leaked documents.
CNN spoke to a Saudi source in London who said he knew Mr Mutreb, describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence, while the popular Arabic app MenoM3ay - which enables users to see the names people have linked to phone numbers - lists a man with that name as a colonel in the royal court.
On October 12 Wikileaks tweeted the Khashoggi Files, which included emails with the name of Mutreb and five other men who were supposed to have attended a course in Italy in 2011, run by an Italian company called Hacking Team.
The emails were part of a dump of 400GB of data first released by Wikileaks in July 2015, which Hacking Team say was stolen from their internal network.
The emails also included conversations that suggested the intelligence agencies Hacking Team worked with used it to spy on activists and journalists.
The emails included a list of countries they sold their tools to, including Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Hacking Team also sells surveillance software, some of which has offensive capabilities.",Yes
578,67,spyware,Coronavirus: Privacy in a pandemic,2 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52135916,"These are strange times. Germany, perhaps the most privacy conscious nation on earth, is considering a mobile phone app that would trace the contacts of anyone infected with Covid-19.
Earlier this week the British Prime Minister shared a picture of an online Cabinet meeting, complete with the Zoom meeting ID and the usernames of ministers. And millions of us are sharing views of our kitchens over this and other video-conferencing apps, without apparently being too concerned about poor privacy controls.
Meanwhile, the National Health Service in England has sent out a document that appears to mark a shift in its policy on patient data, giving staff more latitude to share information relating to the coronavirus. In particular, it mentions the use of data to understand trends in the spread and impact of the virus and ""and the management of patients with or at risk of Covid-19 including: locating, contacting, screening, flagging and monitoring such patients"".
In other words, hospital staff and GPs, who until now may have been cautious almost to the point of paranoia about data protection, can chill out a little.
As someone who has previously been asked by my optician to take pictures on my phone of an eye scan and take them to a hospital doctor because they were not permitted to email them, the new policy seems sensible.
So are we becoming more relaxed about privacy because of the pandemic, or are we in danger of allowing governments and corporations to trample over our rights using the excuse of the emergency?
The former Portuguese Europe Minister Bruno Macaes, now a writer and commentator, made it clear where he stands in this startling tweet:
The idea that any concern about privacy in the battle against the virus is not only irrelevant but could prove fatal is at one extreme of this argument.
At the other are some privacy campaigners, who appear to think that any form of monitoring people with the virus risks the creation of a surveillance state.
We can see this battle playing out in the debate over the contact-tracing apps now being considered by a number of European countries, including the UK.
A press conference with a consortium of European scientists aiding their development began with a clear declaration about putting privacy at their core.
Hans-Christian Boos, an AI entrepreneur and adviser to Chancellor Merkel, is one of the initiative's leaders.
He said one of the motivating factors was to address the question: ""Can we really build proximity-tracing while preserving privacy completely?""
It is possible, they concluded, if the system is built round the use of Bluetooth signals and anonymous IDs. Singapore's TraceTogether, which already does this, is being cited as a good example.
But some countries are taking a less cautious approach.
Russia's Social Monitoring app for citizens who have tested positive for Covid-19, will request access to calls, location, camera, storage, network information and other data to check they do not leave their home while contagious.
Taiwan has been using network data to monitor citizens in quarantine, in one case resulting in a man getting a visit from the police 45 minutes after his phone went flat.
And perhaps the most extreme option is a software tool being touted by the Israeli spyware firm NSO Group. It envisages governments telling mobile phone operators to hand over all their data on the movements of every subscriber.
When I asked an NHS official whether such an approach would be feasible here, I could almost hear him turn white over the phone.
The team working on an app for the UK is acutely conscious that it needs to retain the trust of the public if they are to achieve a target of getting about 60% of the population to install it when released.
Telling citizens their government will be logging their every move would be a clear deterrent .
But here's the problem. Getting apps and other technology solutions out there fast, while cutting a few privacy corners, could mean that lockdowns and the other restrictions on daily life might be be eased earlier.
Countries like the UK which are more cautious about privacy are likely to be slower in rolling out contact-tracing technology - and that may mean they are locked down for longer.
So, might the public be willing to trade one kind of freedom -  the right to privacy - for another - the right to leave their homes and return to work?
As with so many areas of our lives, the virus is forcing us to confront difficult questions about our priorities.",Yes
579,68,spyware,Disney+ fans without answers after thousands hacked,19 November 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50461171,"Thousands of Disney customers say they have been hacked after signing up to its online streaming service.
Since Disney+ went live, attackers have stolen thousands of customers' accounts and put them up for sale on the dark web, according to a report.
People waited on telephone and online chat lines for hours, and many still say that Disney has yet to sort their problems.
But the firm says it does not believe its systems have been compromised.
""Disney takes the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously and there is no indication of a security breach on Disney+,"" a spokesman said.
The statement indicates that members' details have been stolen by other means.
That could involve spyware on users' devices or the re-use of login details stolen from elsewhere.
Disney's answer to Netflix, Disney+ is an online platform where fans can view its movies, short films and TV shows, including the Marvel and Star Wars franchises.
Ten million people signed up in its first week.
Disney+ has not yet launched in the UK, but is available in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.
On 12 November, its first day live, people had technical problems and many complained on social media.
Others said they were locked out of their accounts, and since they contacted Disney they have not heard back.
According to an investigation by Zdnet, thousands of user accounts went on sale on the dark web.
Only hours after the service launched, hackers were selling Disney+ accounts for as little as $3 (Â£2.30).
A subscription to the service costs $7 (Â£5.40) a month.
With the help of a cyber-security researcher, the BBC also found several hacked customer accounts for sale on the dark web.
Thousands of these stolen accounts show what kind of subscription the person signed up with and when it expires.
Customers say they saw their emails and passwords changed.
Many say they used unique userIDs and passwords to access the streaming platform.
But Jason Hill, a lead researcher with CyberInt, says it looks like many were stolen because people use the same passwords for different sites.
Mr Hill said that hackers can lift someone's password from a different site which has previously been hacked and then try it on a new site, like Disney+. If it works, they steal the account.
""Whilst many may consider having a unique password for each online service to be difficult to manage, password managers simplify this process and allow you to generate and securely store unique difficult-to-guess passwords,"" he said.
The streaming service does not have two-factor authentication.
This is when a separate password is sent upon login, to verify an account identity.
Others are concerned because they can use their Disney+ login to access other products the company provides, like the Disney store and its recreation parks.
The online streaming service was hit by technical issues on its first day. People took to social media to complain that their pre-ordered streaming service did not work and that they faced long waits for customer service.
The company said in a tweet that it had an ""overwhelming response"" and apologised.",Yes

But the independent UN experts - Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression - said the crown prince's ""possible involvement"" had to be investigated.
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post - worsened after Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government and one of the newspaper's staff, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
The killing took place months after the alleged cyber-hack took place.
Mr Bezos's phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from the crown prince's personal account, according to the Guardian newspaper, which broke the story.
An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaire's phone began secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received the encrypted video file.
In a statement, Ms Callamard and Mr Kaye said: ""The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia.""
It said the allegations reinforced ""other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities"".
The experts linked the case heavily to the Khashoggi murder, saying the Post reporter's phone had been hacked at the same time as Mr Bezos's.
They said there had been ""a massive, clandestine online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon, apparently targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post"".
The statement also called for ""rigorous control"" of the ""unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware"".
The UN experts cited ""a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr Bezos' iPhone that assessed with 'medium to high confidence' that his phone was infiltrated on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account utilised personally by Mohammed bin Salman"".
The crown prince and Mr Bezos had reportedly exchanged numbers a month earlier and within hours of the MP4's arrival, there was a ""massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data"" from Mr Bezos's phone.
The analysis cited by the experts says the crown prince then ""sent WhatsApp messages to Mr Bezos... in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos' personal life"".
Private information was then leaked to the American tabloid, the National Enquirer. In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of ""extortion and blackmail"" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren SÃ¡nchez.
A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a ""long period"".
The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy issued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince.
""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,"" the embassy said.
Mr Bezos has made no response to the UN experts' statement, but did tweet an image of himself with Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, along with the tag #Jamal:
Analysis by Jane Wakefield, BBC News technology reporter
A hack such as this was ""horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered,"" says computer expert Prof Alan Woodward. The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone.
From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone, from the GPS locator, to the camera, to the banking facilities and messaging apps.
Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and, last year, a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealed that would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files.
Phone hacking is, says Prof Woodward, all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists, dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes. So-called stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments.
But what about the involvement of the Saudi crown prince? Was it really him who installed the malware? It is unlikely that he set the phone up himself. So was his phone also being spied on? Or was he simply a vessel being used by the Saudi authorities?

581,70,spyware,Anand Teltumbde: Cards and letters for jailed India scholar as he turns 70,15 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-53400138,"Prominent Indian scholar and human rights defender Anand Teltumbde has turned 70 in a Mumbai prison amid growing calls for his release, writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi.
""Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.""
Professor Teltumbde often quoted these iconic words from German Lutheran Pastor Martin Niemoller, criticising silence when faced with evil, in his books and speeches.
On Wednesday, when he turns 70 in a Mumbai jail where he's been imprisoned for 90 days, his family and friends are trying to ensure that he's not greeted with silence.
Scores of letters and cards wishing him well on his birthday are expected to be delivered at Taloja jail where he's being held.
""Anand is a respected academic who's been shut away for completely dubious reasons,"" Balmurli Natrajan, professor of anthropology at William Paterson University in New Jersey, who is among the people writing a letter to Prof Teltumbde, told the BBC.
""We want him to know that we are constantly thinking of him, reading his books.""
Counted among India's best-known public intellectuals, Prof Teltumbde has authored 30 books and is known for his incisive writing on India's harsh caste system.
Born to a Dalit (formerly untouchables in India's rigid caste system) family, he worked in top positions in some of India's biggest oil companies before moving to academia. At present, he's head of the Big Data programme at the prestigious Goa Institute of Management.
A trenchant critic of the government, he's described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ""more dangerous than Hitler and Mussolini"" and a ""narcissist par excellence"".
On 14 April, when Prof Teltumbde turned himself in to federal investigators on court orders, he joined 10 other activists, poets and lawyers who have been arrested in connection with what is known as the Bhima Koregaon case.
They are being held under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) - an anti-terrorism law that makes it almost impossible to get bail.
Police accuse them of instigating caste violence at a Dalit rally in Bhima Koregaon village in the western state of Maharashtra on 1 January 2018.
Although those detained weren't present in the village at the time, police blamed the violence on their speeches at a meeting the night before.
They are also accused of working in tandem with the Naxalites - banned ultra-left Maoist rebels - to ""overthrow the government and cause chaos in India"".
But Indian and international campaigners and rights organisations working for their release say they've been jailed for criticising the state.
""All the 11 activists have worked relentlessly to protect the rights of some of India's most marginalised people, including Dalits and tribals,"" Amnesty International said in one of the several statements it has put out in the past few months calling for their release.
Human Rights Watch has called the detentions ""wrongful"" and ""politically motivated"" and questioned why the government did not investigate the allegations that Hindu nationalist leaders may have had a role in the Bhima Koregaon violence?
In May, the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights wrote to Home Minister Amit Shah saying it was alarmed by the ""intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders"" by the authorities.
The letter also urged India to immediately release all prisoners in view of the coronavirus pandemic - most of the detainees are elderly with underlying health conditions and thus at serious risk of catching the infection in overcrowded jails.
Prof Natrajan says India has always been ""a marketplace of ideas"", pointing out that Nobel laureate Amartya Sen once called Indians ""argumentative"". But in the past eight years, the space for argument and debate has been shrinking.
Prof Teltumbde, he says, has been setting the contours of key debates on globalisation and politics of caste and religion for the past 30 years.
""He's been calling out caste deniers and Hindu triumphalism. He's dared to point fingers at the powerful classes - he's telling them, 'here's what you're doing and how it's put a majority of Indian people in misery'. And that makes him a dangerous man.""
Prof Teltumbde, says his wife Rama, was shocked when his name first came up two years back in the list of accused in the Bhima Koregaon case.
""We hadn't even imagined it in our worst dreams that something like this could ever happen to us,"" she told me on the phone from Mumbai.
""My husband is not a criminal,"" she says, her voice breaking with emotion. ""He's an academic, a workaholic who spent 14-15 hours daily reading, writing and teaching.""
In his free time, she says, he would try to help the poor and the marginalised because he wanted to see an India that's better, more just.
""To be thrown into jail for that is a very high price to pay.""
Since her husband has been jailed, Mrs Teltumbde has been allowed a weekly two-minute phone call with him.
""I always ask him how's his health? And how's the prison food because I know the food there is very bad. He doesn't want to worry us, so he always says he's fine. And then he asks about his mother and our daughters.""
Mrs Teltumbde is the granddaughter of Bhimrao Ambedkar - the author of India's constitution and an icon to millions of Dalits - and says she believes that her grandfather wouldn't recognise today's India.
""I don't think he envisaged this kind of India where people are arrested for speaking their mind. We live in a democracy and freedom of speech is a right guaranteed under the constitution.""
But critics say it's a right that is under grave threat in today's India.
Those criticising PM Modi are attacked on social media by nationalist trolls, and activists and students opposing the government are being jailed. Most of the dissenters are charged under UAPA and being held in prison without bail.
Earlier this year, police in Delhi arrested several students who had protested against a controversial new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims. They were labelled as ""anti-nationals working to break up India"" by news channels friendly to the government. Female activists were slut-shamed on social media.
While most continue to languish in overcrowded prisons, Safoora Zargar, a pregnant female student, was freed after three months in jail following global condemnation.
""The government is playing with the liberties of people by arresting them under flimsy charges,"" says Mihir Desai, Prof Teltumbde's lawyer.
""The central charge against Prof Teltumbde,"" he says, ""is that he was helping the Naxalites by getting them recruits and spreading their ideology and that he was taking money from them.""
But when they raided his house, he says, they did not find any arms or cash.
The only evidence the police have put forth so far are four ""letters"" that they waved at a press conference.
Mr Desai says they are typed and unsigned and there are no addresses or email addresses on them.
He says they are not written by Prof Teltumbde or addressed to him - the one thing they all have in common is the mention of an ""Anand"" which is a common Indian name.
""These letters appear to be manufactured,"" he says adding that ""even if they are real, how do they prove that this Anand is Prof Teltumbde? Also, anyone can write anything to anyone, but is that proof? These can't exist as evidence.""
The evidence is unlikely to stand scrutiny in court, Mr Desai says, but it's the process that's the punishment.
""If a person is jailed for 10 years while the case goes on, their life is ruined.""
As Prof Teltumbde completes three months in prison, his wife Rama says their only demand is for him to be freed on bail and the government to start the trial soon so that ""his name can be cleared"".
A day before he was taken into custody, Prof Teltumbde wrote an open letter where he detailed the harassment he says he's faced in the past two years - he wrote about how his home was raided, his Wikipedia page was vandalised, and how the government inserted Israeli spyware on his phone.
""As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim momentâ¦ I do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again.
""However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes,"" he wrote.
By jailing him, Prof Natrajan says, the government is trying to crush the very people who are trying to reason and debate.
""But mark my words, Anand will not be crushed. You can jail people, torture them, kill them, but you cannot beat ideas.""",Yes
582,71,spyware,Lebanon frees actor Ziad Itani accused of collaborating with Israel,13 March 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43390213,"A prominent Lebanese actor who has spent months in detention accused of collaborating with Israel has had the case against him dropped.
A judge freed Ziad Itani from detention and ordered the arrest of a security officer who built the case against him.
Mr Itani was suspected of gathering information on Lebanese politicians with a view to passing it on to Israel.
Lebanon technically remains at war with Israel and collaborating is punishable by death.
Mr Itani was detained in November on charges of ""collaborating and communicating with the Israeli enemy"".
State security officials said his arrest followed ""several months of monitoring, follow-up and investigations"".
It was alleged that Mr Itani had confessed to being ""tasked to monitor a group of high-level political figures"". However, close associates said his ""confession"" was extracted under duress, a claim denied by the authorities.
The case has been widely covered in Lebanese media and has thrown a spotlight on the country's security apparatus.
As he left Roumieh Prison on Tuesday, a tearful Mr Itani flashed a ""V"" for victory sign and said he had been subjected to a great injustice.
""I am an artist and the son of the stage... how could I be accused of such ugly things?"" Lebanon's official National News Agency reported him saying.
Prime Minister Saad Hariri later met the actor and said the security services had received ""wrong information"".
The security officer arrested on the judges orders was a former head of an anti-cybercrime unit, Lt Col Suzan Hobeiche.
She was taken into detention earlier this month on suspicion of having fabricated evidence against the actor. It is not clear exactly what charges she now faces.",Yes
583,72,spyware,"Serpentine: Yana Peel resigns over 'toxic, personal attacks'",18 June 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/48673980,"Yana Peel, the CEO of the Serpentine Galleries in London, has resigned from her role after three years in the job.
Peel said her decision came ""in light of a concerted lobbying campaign against my husband's recent investment"" referencing ""toxic, personal attacks"".
Peel's husband is an owner of investment company Novalpina Capital Management International, which invests in controversial Israeli tech firm NSO.
Amnesty International has criticised NSO's use of surveillance technology.
In a statement, Serpentine Galleries said Peel ""will be sorely missed. The arts sector will be poorer without her immeasurable contributions to our cultural lives.""
Peel said in her statement: ""The work of the Serpentine... cannot be allowed to be undermined by misguided personal attacks on me and my family. These attacks are based upon inaccurate media reports now subject to legal complaints.
""I have decided I am better able to continue my work in supporting the arts, the advancement of human rights and freedom of expression by moving away from my current role.""
She added: ""The world of art is about free expression. But it is not about bullying and intimidation. I welcome debate and discussion about the realities of life in the digital age. There is a place for these debates, but they should be constructive, fair and factual - not based upon toxic personal attacks.""
Mrs Peel owns one-third of the Novalpina holding company but her representatives stress she has only a single-digit percentage, indirect interest in the relevant fund and no role in operational or investment decisions.
Novalpina began funding NSO Group Technologies earlier this year.
NSO has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.
But the group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour.
According to its own website, NSO Group ""provides the tools that support official authorities to lawfully address the most dangerous issues in today's world. Governments use our products to prevent terrorism, break up criminal operations, find missing persons, and assist search and rescue teams.""
Following an exchange of letters with human rights organisation Amnesty, Novalpina issued a statement last week announcing ""a new framework"" to ""bring NSO Group in full alignment with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights"".
It continued: ""Novalpina and NSO will do whatever necessary to ensure NSO's technology is used only for its intended lawful purpose - the prevention of harm to our fundamental human rights to life, liberty and security from acts of terrorism and serious crime.""
The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab monitors digital attacks against civil society and has been tracking the NSO Group for several years.
In a letter published on Tuesday, Citizen Lab said it had ""sent multiple letters to Novalpina Capital LLP and NSO Group seeking specific answers regarding a number of concerns, including at least 31 reports of abusive targeting. These questions remain largely unanswered"".
The Serpentine said it was ""with a mix of gratitude and regret that the board of trustees of the Serpentine Galleries has accepted the resignation of CEO Yana Peel.
""Since taking on the role in 2016, Yana has done an exemplary job furthering the mission, visibility, and financial standing of the Serpentine, increasing support and donations, overseeing ground-breaking exhibitions, and expanding the Serpentine's programme internationally year over year.""
Peel oversaw programmes from artists such as Grayson Perry and Rose Wylie and commissioned touring exhibitions to Milan, Miami, Paris, Berlin, Chicago, New York and Hong Kong.
Correction 1 April 2020: An earlier version of this article said that Yana Peel was listed on company records as an indirect owner of Novalpina. This has been since amended to explain that at the time of publication she owned one-third of a holding company, Novalpina Capital Group. Ms Peel's representatives have explained this means she had no control or involvement in the Novalpina Capital investment fund, which acquired a stake in NSO Group. Our article has also been updated to make that clear.

His comments on President Donald Trump's administration have caused problems for her government but Theresa May is giving Sir Kim Darroch  - the UK's ambassador to the US - her ""full support"". However, Downing Street says the emails he sent in 2017 ""do not reflect the closeness of, and the esteem in which we hold, the relationship"" between the countries.
Sir Kim's messages described the Trump administration - then in its early days - as ""dysfunctional"" and ""clumsy and inept"". The president has responded to their publication with anger, tweeting on Monday that he and his colleagues would ""no longer deal"" with Sir Kim.
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg describes Downing Street's stance as a ""stiff brush-off"". Here's her take on the situation.
The two men battling it out to be Conservative leader and prime minister meet for the first time in a one-to-one TV debate later. ITV's Julie Etchingham will oversee the hour-long event, in which Tory members and other members of the public ask questions, from 20:00 BST.

""It's important to talk about the cost of going to open days,"" says Rachel, a sixth-former from Plymouth who is looking at university choices. ""Not everyone can afford to go out of their area. Train tickets are expensive and there's most likely accommodation as well.""
This is peak season for university open days, when tens of thousands of teenagers and their families are criss-crossing the country viewing places where they might study. A return trip by train from north to south can cost Â£200 or even Â£300. And even with railcard discounts, when there might be four or five universities to visit, the open-day season can soon become an unaffordable closed door.

585,74,spyware,Alice Ruggles: Police and Army 'failed' stalking victim,19 March 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-47617329,"Police and Army bosses have been criticised for failings leading up to the death of a stalking victim at the hands of her soldier ex-boyfriend.
Trimaan Dhillon cut 24-year-old Alice Ruggles' throat after breaking into her Gateshead flat in October 2016.
A review has found Northumbria Police and the Army failed to properly address signs of L/Cpl Dhillon's jealous and obsessive behaviour.
Dhillon, 26, was jailed for a minimum of 22 years after a trial last year.
A domestic homicide review, carried out by Gateshead Community Safety Board, concluded Miss Ruggles was subjected to ""significant stalking"" and that Army officials failed to record a previous domestic assault charge against Dhillon in Kent.
The review heard Miss Ruggles, who was originally from Tur Langton, near Market Harborough in Leicestershire and worked for Sky, had contacted Northumbria Police about Dhillon's stalking in the days before her death.
In one a call handler asked Miss Ruggles if she wanted him to be arrested, but she declined. The review found police should have made that decision and it should not have been left to the victim.
The review noted that a police officer did contact Dhillon's barracks in Edinburgh and spoke to a superior, but not Military Police or Police Scotland, and Dhillon was then told by the regiment to stop contacting her or face arrest.
But he ignored the warning and eventually drove 120 miles to Tyneside to murder Miss Ruggles.
The report concluded: ""The perpetrator's willingness to travel provided an indication of the level of his obsessive behaviour that was overlooked.
""In addition, there was a lack of clarity about the roles and responsibilities of the Home Office, police and armed forces, which led to some confusion about how best to deal with the perpetrator.""
The review made 20 recommendations, including making it an offence to threaten to release intimate photos of an ex-partner, as Dhillon did when Miss Ruggles called off their relationship.
It also urged the Home Office to review the effectiveness of the police 101 non-emergency number, after it emerged Miss Ruggles abandoned a call to Northumbria Police after being kept on hold for almost seven minutes.
The review described the incident as a ""missed opportunity to support Alice"".
Last year the the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said two Northumbria officers had cases of misconduct to answer while another had performed unsatisfactorily.
It also found the force treated the matter as harassment rather than stalking. The force has since apologised to Miss Ruggles' parents, Sue Hill and Clive Ruggles.
The review also called on the Home Office to review the legality of spyware after concerns about the ease in which Dhillon was able to hack Miss Ruggles' social media accounts.
Responding to the report, Ms Hill and Mr Ruggles said: ""Alice died in tragic circumstances and it is important that failings are acknowledged, lessons learned, and improvements made.
""We hope that the Army will now realise that they have an important part to play when one of their soldiers is accused of criminal behaviour against a civilian and, like other agencies, will proceed to learn lessons from Alice's case.""
Brigadier Christopher Coles, head of Army personnel services group, said: ""We are committed to tacking domestic abuse and last year launched a strategy to help prevent domestic abuse in all its forms.
""This includes prevention of abuse in the home and providing support to the families of service personnel who may be affected.""
Northumbria Police's assistant chief constable Rachel Bacon said: ""With the help of Alice's family we are now leading the way in training officers in the best way to deal with these types of offences.
""Their continued determination to change the law to better protect victims of stalking is commendable.""",Yes

Research by BBC News suggests that a quarter of patients with sepsis have experienced delays in getting treatment. Hospitals are supposed to put a person on an antibiotic drip within an hour if sepsis is suspected. While the charity UK Sepsis Trust says the figures are concerning, NHS England insists hospitals are getting better at spotting the condition.
But the widow of one man who died after developing sepsis told the BBC she was ""angry"" at the delay in treating him with antibiotics. Hayley Scott said her husband, Simon, waited six days to get treated, despite his hospital notes suggesting he should have been on them from day two. The hospital has said there were ""areas of learning"" resulting from his case.
Sepsis is caused by the immune system over-reacting to an infection, and can lead to septic shock, organ failure and even death. Find out more about sepsis here, and why one man wants mandatory training for NHS staff.
It may have been only last Sunday that US President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the demilitarised zone which divides the two Koreas, but relations between them appear to have soured already. Pyongyang's delegation to the United Nations has accused Washington of being ""obsessed with sanctions"" and ""hell-bent on hostile acts"". The rhetorical skirmish came about because the US and other Western nations have written a joint letter calling for further sanctions on North Korea. The US has yet to respond to the North Korea statement.
Meanwhile, an Australian who went missing in North Korea last week has been released and is safe. It is understood Alex Sigley is now in China and will travel on to Japan.

587,76,spyware,'Smart' television watches you,31 October 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-echochambers-29826642,"A review of the best commentary on and around the world...
""The FBI will not have to bug your living room; you will do it yourself.""
So says Michael Price of Salon.com, the nervous new owner of a ""smart"" TV - a web-connected telly that recognises his face, listens to his voice, and could send that information (and more, including emails he receives) to a third party.
""Got that? Don't say personal or sensitive stuff in front of the TV,"" writes Price.
""I do not doubt that this data is important to providing customised content and convenience, but it is also incredibly personal, constitutionally protected information that should not be for sale to advertisers and should require a warrant for law enforcement to access.""
The Daily Mail reports British IT consultant Jason Huntley found his LG smart TV had sent his children's names, unencrypted, over the internet ""because he had watched a family video on his set"".
Price explains current laws offer very little privacy protection to the ""third party records"", including data stored in the cloud (although one federal court of appeals has found this rule unconstitutional with respect to email).
Speaking about web-based ""smart"" devices, retired General David Petraeus, former head of the CIA, said in 2012 that ""Items of interest will be located, identified, monitor, and remotely controlled through technologies such as radio-frequency identification, sensor networks, tiny embedded servers and energy harvester."" That means, Price argues, as the ""Internet of Things"" matures, household appliances - even your socks - may be wired to interact online.
Of course, it is possible to disable data collection, but that immobilises many of the high-tech functions.
""This leaves consumers with an unacceptable choice between keeping up with technology and retaining their personal privacyâ¦ We should not have to channel surf worried that the TV is recording our behaviour for the benefit of advertisers and police. Companies need to become more mindful of consumer privacy when deciding whether to collect personal data.""
A Chinese partner in cyber-security - Russia and China see eye-to-eye on their increased role in cyber-security, according to Elena Chernenko, Vladislav Novyii and Ivan Safronov in Russia's Kommersant. Both countries support the ""internationalisation"" of internet management, which includes the sovereign right of a government to control internet sites in ""its own national segment"" (the US does not recognize the existence of national segments).
Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Beijing next month, where he is expected to sign a bilateral agreement on cyber-security. This follows several collaborative deals between China and Russia in information technology and communications. In May, the Russian state telecom company signed a $60m (Â£37.5m) contract with Chinese company Huawei to build an underwater communication line in the Russian Far East.
Meanwhile, they say, any US-China partnership is mired in disagreement over US accusations of Chinese industrial and government cyber-espionage
An out-of-date economic playbook - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged a number of ""third-arrow"" reforms to bring about Japan's resurgence, but Bloomberg's William Pesek says these would have been appropriate 10 to 15 years ago - more modern measures are necessary.
Today Japan should provide more support for a start-up boom, the end of Amakudari - ""the equivalent of the revolving door that shifts Wall Street bankers into top Washington jobs and back"" - and more flexible immigration policies.
Pesek also says a forward-thinking energy policy, reducing trade barriers and greater gender equality in public-sector leadership roles are necessary if Japan is finally going to turn things around.
Little progress three years after Muammar Gaddafi - The past several months have been a turbulent period of violence, resulting in a divisive political situation, according to Gianluca Eramo of the Libya Herald. The author says in addition to local fighting, neighbouring countries and regional powers are manoeuvring and steering among Libyan militias to gain access, power and control.
""The international community must urgently develop a concrete political strategy to support the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people for security, dignity and democracy,"" said Eramo.
Political discourse that focuses on shared, open and fair transitional justice mechanisms can shift attention from the current tendency to look outside the country for political backing and support, says Eramo. ""It can therefore also help reduce the risk of external actors fuelling cycles of violence.""
Little help on Ebola from within - Almost 40 years after Ebola was first identified, Africa does not have the capacity to play a pivotal role in fighting the virus, argues Brian Sedze of the Standard. The continent, he says, has not invested in research, believing some overseas country would do the research instead.
""The continent seems to be completely outraged at the international community for what they believe is a lethargic reaction to efforts at containing the Ebola epidemic,"" Sedze adds. ""There are also murmurs of disapproval that the US provided 3,900 soldiers to help in the fight of Ebola instead of medical personnel.""
The question, he asks, is how many doctors and nurses did Africa itself provide for this effort. The lack of personnel might be explained by the ever present dependency syndrome.
""While the world was doing all this for us, Africa was busy spending millions sponsoring tribal conflicts, billions of dollars on corruption, funding lavish lifestyles of its corrupt leaders, siphoning billions of dollars to tax havens and sponsoring warped priorities that only encourage political expedience at the cost of lives of its citizens,"" he concludes
Israeli columnists react to an unnamed senior US official insulting Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu in an Atlantic magazine article earlier this week.
""This is just the latest in a series of vindictive acts by the Obama administration because Israel has dared to reject its diktats... Netanyahu should be commended for withstanding the unreasonable pressure from Obama and Kerry, avoiding outright confrontations and in so doing, retaining the support of American public opinion and Congress."" - Isi Leibler in Yisrael Hayom.
""The latest attack signals the policy the United States will adopt toward Netanyahu's government following the upcoming congressional elections and in the two years left for Obama at the White House. The tight security and intelligence cooperation will continue, but the diplomatic protection at the UN and international forums will not be immediate and granted."" - Barak Ravid in Ha'aretz.â

588,77,spyware,WhatsApp hack: Is any app or computer truly secure?,15 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48282092,"WhatsApp has confirmed that a security flaw in the app let attackers install spy software on their targets' smartphones.
That has left many of its 1.5 billion users wondering how safe the ""simple and secure"" messaging app really is.
On Wednesday, chip-maker Intel confirmed that new problems discovered with some of its processors could reveal secret information to attacks.
How trustworthy are apps and devices?
No. Messages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they are scrambled when they leave the sender's device. The messages can be decrypted by the recipient's device only.
That means law enforcement, service providers and cyber-criminals cannot read any messages they intercept as they travel across the internet.
However, there are some caveats.
Messages can be read before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. That means any spyware dropped on the phone by an attacker could read the messages.
On Tuesday, news site Bloomberg published an opinion article calling WhatsApp's encryption ""pointless"", given the security breach.
However, that viewpoint has been widely ridiculed by cyber-security experts.
""I don't think it's helpful to say end-to-end encryption is pointless just because a vulnerability is occasionally found,"" said Dr Jessica Barker from the cyber-security company Cygenta.
""Encryption is a good thing that does offer us protection in most cases.""
Cyber-security is often a game of cat and mouse.
End-to-end encryption makes it much harder for attackers to read messages, even if they do eventually find a way to access some of them.
WhatsApp gives the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but those back-up copies are not protected by the end-to-end encryption.
An attacker could access old chats if they broke into a cloud storage account.
Of course, even if users decide not to back up chats, the people they message may still upload a copy to their cloud storage.
Ultimately, any app could contain a security vulnerability that leaves a phone open to attackers.
WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which typically issues software fixes quickly.
Of course, even large companies can make mistakes and Facebook has had its share of data and privacy breaches over the years.
There is no guarantee a rival chat app would not experience a similar security lapse.
At least, following the disclosure of this flaw, WhatsApp is slightly more secure than it was a week ago.
Some rival chat apps are open-source projects, which means anybody can look at the code powering the app and suggest improvements.
""Open-source software has its value in that it be can tested more widely but it doesn't necessarily mean it's more secure,"" said Dr Barker.
""Vulnerabilities can still be found with any tech, so it's not the answer to our prayers.""
And if someone did decide to switch to a rival chat app, they would still have to convince their contacts to do the same. A chat app without friends is not much use.
In theory, any device or service could be hacked. In fact, security researchers often joyfully pile in on companies that claim their products are ""unhackable"".
They quickly discover vulnerabilities and the embarrassed companies retract their claims.
If people are worried data may be stolen from their computer, one option is to ""air gap"" the device: disconnect it from the internet entirely.
That stops remote hackers accessing the machine - but even an air gap would not stop an attacker with physical access to the device.
Dr Barker stressed the importance of installing software updates for apps and operating systems.
""WhatsApp pushed out an update and consumers might not have realised that security fixes are often included in updates,"" she told BBC News.
WhatsApp did not help the cause, however, by describing the latest update as adding ""full-size stickers"", and not mentioning the security breach.
""People need to be made aware that updates are really important. The quicker we can update our apps, the more secure we are,"" said Dr Barker.
As always, there are simple security steps to remember:",Yes
589,78,spyware,"Mexico 'spied on journalists, lawyers and activists'",20 June 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-40337770,"Several prominent journalists and activists in Mexico have filed a complaint accusing the government of spying on them by hacking their phones.
The accusation follows a report in the New York Times that says they were targeted with spyware meant to be used against criminals and terrorists.
The newspaper says messages examined by forensic analysts show the software was used against government critics.
A Mexican government spokesman ""categorically"" denied the allegations.
The report says that the software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists.
The software can infiltrate smartphones and monitor calls, texts and other communications, the New York Times said. It can also activate a phone's microphone or camera, effectively turning the device into a personal bug.
But instead of being used to track suspected criminals, the targets allegedly included investigative journalists, anti-corruption activists and even lawyers.

Nine people have now filed a criminal complaint. At a news conference in Mexico City, journalist Carmen Aristegui accused the state of criminal activity.
""The agents of the Mexican state, far from doing what they should be doing legally, have used our resources, our taxes, our money to commit serious crimes,"" she said.
A spokesman for President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto rejected the allegations, saying that the government carries out intelligence work against the organised crime and threats to the national security in accordance with the country's laws, but that it does not include journalists or activists.
""The government categorically denies that any of its members carries out surveillance or interference in communications of defenders of human rights, journalists, anti-corruption activists or any other person without prior judicial authorization,"" a spokesman told the BBC.",Yes
590,79,spyware,Amnesty releases anti-spying program for activists,20 November 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30115679,"Amnesty International has released a program that can spot spying software used by governments to monitor activists and political opponents.
The Detekt software was needed as standard anti-virus programs often missed spying software, it said.
Amnesty said many governments used sophisticated spying tools that could grab images from webcams or listen via microphones to monitor people.
It wants to see more regulation of the spying software used by governments.
""These spying tools are marketed on their ability to get round your bog-standard anti-virus,"" said Tanya O'Carroll, an adviser on technology and human rights at Amnesty International.
The makers of spying software did extensive testing to ensure that the way they infected and lurked on a computer did not trigger security alerts, she added.
Detekt has been developed over the past two years to spot the few telltale signs spying programs do leave. The intense scan it carries out on a hard drive means a computer cannot be used while Detekt is running.
Four separate rights groups - Amnesty International, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Privacy International and Digitale Gesellschaft - have worked together to create the spyware spotter, which is available free of charge.
The group is now looking for help to keep Detekt up to date and expand the range of spying programs it can catch.
The first version of Detekt has been written to run on Windows computers because the people most often being monitored use that software, said Ms O'Carroll.
Many repressive governments had been using spying software for some time and the programs were becoming increasingly popular with democratically elected governments too, said Ms Carroll. Spying software has been found on the computers of activists in Bahrain, Syria, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Germany, Tibet, North Korea and many other nations.
""It's easier to name the countries that are not using these spying tools than those that are,"" she said.
The trade in spyware used by governments is now a market worth about Â£3bn ($5bn) a year, said Ms O'Carroll, adding it was time for this trade to be better regulated.
Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey, who advises governments on security issues, wondered how easy it would be for Amnesty and its partners to maintain Detekt.
""It's not really their core business,"" he said. ""Are they going to keep updating the software because the spyware variants change daily?""
He also questioned how useful it would be against regimes that used specially written software rather than commercial versions that were well known and documented.
""If a technique is known about widely, those regimes will assume it's going to be ineffective and use another approach,"" he said.
Claudio Guarnieri, the German security researcher who created Detekt, said there was a growing roster of firms producing spying software.
""People think the uses of spyware by governments are isolated cases. They are not,"" Mr Guarnieri told the BBC. ""Their discovery is isolated.
""Spyware is becoming the final solution for surveillance operations to overcome encryption.
""The real problem is nobody really asked the public whether that's acceptable and some countries are legitimising their use without considering the consequences and inherent issues.""
The software is spread in booby-trapped attachments on email messages, by seeding malware on compromised sites or with fake messaging software, said Mr Guarnieri.
Karl Zetterlund, a senior researcher at security firm Sentor, said the needs of law enforcement were understandably different to those of the average cyberthief.
""Criminals are mainly interested in information that can somehow generate money. Law enforcement spyware may only need to collect a few pieces of identifying information, such as a net address, from the computer,"" he said.
""Generally, policeware may be better at hiding, as normal malware often aims for strength in numbers and spreading is more important than passing under the radar.""
There had also been cases in the past, he said, when computer security companies collaborated with governments to ignore spyware they found planted on machines.",Yes
591,80,spyware,100 webcam blackmails reported to Police Service of Northern Ireland this year,15 October 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37668213,"The Police Service of Northern Ireland have said that 100 webcam blackmails have been reported to them this year.
They say that people of all ages have been targeted and that ""cyber-stalking is becoming a prevalent issue in Northern Ireland"".
Police have warned people to review their privacy and security settings and ensure updated anti-spyware is installed in devices.
They said education on ""the risks of cyber-stalking"" was crucial.
Last year, police said they were investigating claims that a number of people in Northern Ireland were being targeted by international crime gangs in the same way as County Tyrone schoolboy Ronan Hughes.
The 17-year-old from Coalisland, was the victim of what police call webcam blackmail and took his own life in June 2015.
Ronan was tricked into sharing intimate images of himself online, and some of them were then sent to his friends when he failed to pay a ransom.
His family said he was being blackmailed by a gang based in Nigeria.",Yes
592,81,spyware,Firms face Â£17m fine if they fail to protect against hackers,8 August 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40857219,"Firms could face fines of up to Â£17m or 4% of global turnover if they fail to protect themselves from cyber-attacks, the government has warned.
The crackdown is aimed at making sure essential services such as water, energy, transport and health firms are safeguarded against hacking attempts.
Firms will also be required to show they have a strategy to cover power failures and environmental disasters.
Digital Minister Matt Hancock said any fines would be a last resort.
They would not apply to firms which had put safeguards in place but still suffered an attack, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said.
Mr Hancock, who is launching a consultation on the plans, said: ""We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to live and be online, with our essential services and infrastructure prepared for the increasing risk of cyber-attack.""
The DCMS said firms that take cyber-security seriously should already have measures in place to prevent attacks or systems failures.
It said the consultation was aimed at determining how to implement the Network and Information Systems (NIS) directive which becomes law across the EU next May.
It is separate from the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which are aimed at protecting data, rather than services.
The GDPR will replace the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 from 25 May next year and the government has confirmed that the UK's decision to leave the EU will not change this.
Earlier this year, NHS services across England and Scotland were hit by a large-scale cyber-attack that disrupted hospital and GP appointments.
And the threat to firms from cyber-attacks appears to have grown.
Nearly half (46%) of British businesses discovered at least one cyber-security breach or attack in the past year, a government survey earlier this year found.
That proportion rose to two-thirds among medium and large companies.
Most often, these breaches involved fraudulent emails being sent to staff or security issues relating to viruses, spyware or malware.",Yes

Police in Dorset have investigated 18 cases in two months, mainly men being blackmailed over photos or videos.
Criminals from a number of countries are obtaining the material after posing as people looking for romance online.
Officers have identified perpetrators in the US, Ghana, Ivory Coast and the Philippines.
In some cases webcams have been activated by spyware to record victims without their knowledge, police said.
Det Supt Mark Callaghan said: ""The problem we have with locating the perpetrators of 'sextortion' offences is the suspects will often hack in to other people's accounts and use a variety of methods to disguise their location.

594,83,spyware,Child watch: The apps that let parents 'spy' on their kids,29 January 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30930512,"Think your kid's being bullied? Or sending sexts? Or dealing drugs? There's an app for that.
In the United States, nearly 80% of teenagers own mobile phones. About half of those are smartphones - with access to the internet, games, cameras and social media.
That worries many parents. And those fears are fuelling a growing number of so-called parent apps - to track what kids are doing online.
TeenSafe can work as a personal CIA spy for parents.
The company urges parents to tell their children they are being monitored, but the app can work covertly and show what kids are posting on social media as well as deleted texts and messages sent via popular apps such as Kik, WhatsApp and Snapchat.
""It's absolutely legal for a parent to do this discreetly,"" says TeenSafe's chief executive Rawdon Messenger.
""The real question is, 'Is it justified?' and those are moral decisions a parent has to make. What we believe is that when it comes to protecting your child from these things - privacy is trumped by protection.""
Mr Messenger says he believes about half the families who use TeenSafe use it to spy on their kids.
TeenSafe operates in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and is hoping to expand to the UK soon. Since it started in 2011, it says it has had 800,000 people sign up for the service.
Aside from tracking social media use and texting, other parent apps can actually monitor how fast someone is driving or moving in a vehicle as a passenger.
MamaBear offers that service, and co-founder Robyn Spoto says the app is used to link entire families and send alerts when someone is driving above the speed limit or has ventured outside a pre-determined boundary. It cannot be used covertly.
""Technology is your right-hand man to give you the information that you need so that you can have the right conversation,"" says Ms Spoto.
She adds that many families find it reassuring to get push notifications about their children's whereabouts.
Ms Spoto uses MamaBear for her parents and 10-year-old son, who does not have a phone but uses an iPod Touch.
But don't her own parents feel annoyed that their adult daughter gets push notifications every time they speed to work or come home at 01:00 from a party? Laughing, Ms Spoto says they're used to it.
""It's not like I'm creeping on them,"" she says, adding that she likes the assurance of knowing they got home safely.
Teenagers are typically better at using technology than their parents, and apps such as these can create a cat-and-mouse game of kids trying to avoid prying eyes.
But the parent apps are prepared - if your child does not call you back or turns the phone off, you can disable the phone so it only works to call mum or dad.
Some call them the ""stalker apps"", worrying that data gathered by smartphone spyware could be misused by suspicious spouses or mistrustful bosses.
And it seems the US authorities share these concerns.
Last year the FBI arrested a man for distributing an app called StealthGenie, which intercepted emails and texts as well as recorded phone calls.
Prosecutors highlighted that the software was marketed as being ""undetectable"" and suggested it was designed for ""stalkers and domestic abusers"".
In the first ever criminal conviction of its kind, Hammad Akbar was subsequently fined $500,000 (Â£332,840) after pleading guilty to advertising and selling the app.
Smartphone monitoring services are, however, legal to use in the US, so long as the software is installed on a device used by either the customer's:
Several available products highlight their restrictions in their small print, even if, occasionally, they also market their ""cheating spouse""-catching potential.
""As far as the UK is concerned, the use of 'stalker apps' could very easily land you on the wrong side of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable UK laws ,"" commented Vin Bange from the law firm Taylor Wessing.
""Domestic use is treated very differently to surveillance in the workplace - the latter is a complex area which requires close observation of the law and employee 'consent' cannot be seen as a silver bullet.""
When asked if they think their parents are spying on them, a random group of teens at a busy shopping centre in Los Angeles thought it was highly unlikely.
Parents are too busy, they say. They trust them.
But when I visited a primary school in Los Angeles, where cyber-security expert Lou Rabon was addressing parents at his son's school, many of the parents were open to tracking their kids' every move.
""I would chip them like a dog if I could,"" one mother said.
Many of the parents there thought they were tech-savvy and were shocked to see how easy it was for Mr Rabon to pinpoint their geographic location by the photos they posted on Facebook - he then taught them how to turn off geo-tagging on their camera phones.
They groaned in horror as he showed online messages a predator had posted in a chat room posing as a depressed and lonely 14-year-old girl looking for friends.
Mr Rabon, who is in the process of creating a parent app of his own, advises parents to use obscure passwords.
One mother told the story of her nine-year-old son who was taught by an older child on the school bus how to get around parental controls on his phone by using a commonly used password in the family.
""Within minutes he had Googled the word 'sex' and my nine-year-old was on a porn site,"" she told parents at the meeting.
""He saw things we hoped he wouldn't see ever or for at least another 10 years.""
It doesn't bode well for parents trying to instil trust and independence in their children.
Mr Rabon says it's naive for parents to blindly trust their kids - and he agrees that in many ways it's a lousy time to be a teenager.
When asked if the next trend would be for teenagers to turn off their phones, he says it wouldn't work - the app he's creating would alert a group of parents if the children in a circle of friends all turned off their phones and would pinpoint their geographic location - ie the party's busted.
""If you want to completely disconnect and raise your children in that world you've got to go to the jungles of the Amazon or something; in the world we live in today this pervasive ubiquitous technology is only going to expand,"" he says, adding that he doesn't want his sons raised in a bubble, but he can't ignore reality.
""This technology could save lives so I think that it's absolutely a great thing to be able to track our kids.""",Yes
595,84,spyware,'Nearly half' of firms had a cyber-attack or breach,19 April 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39641292,"Nearly half (46%) of British businesses discovered at least one cybersecurity breach or attack in the past year, a government survey has indicated.
That proportion rose to two-thirds among medium and large companies.
Most often, these breaches involved fraudulent emails being sent to staff or security issues relating to viruses, spyware or malware.
The survey was completed by 1,500 UK businesses and included 30 in-depth interviews.
The government said a ""sizeable proportion"" of the businesses still did not have ""basic protections"" in place.
While many had enacted rudimentary technical controls, only one-third had a formal policy covering cybersecurity risks.
Less than a third (29%) had assigned a specific board member to be responsible for cybersecurity.
Businesses' susceptibility to cyber-attacks was a known issue, noted Prof Andrew Martin at the University of Oxford.
""A lot of businesses have responded to the problem with a box-ticking exercise or by paying an expensive consultant to make them feel better - it's far from clear that what people are doing is protecting them very well,"" he told the BBC.
He added it remained difficult for most people to distinguish malicious emails or websites from safe ones.
""It's all very well to say don't open emails from an unknown source - but most of us couldn't do business if [we] didn't do that,"" he added.
The government's survey indicates, however, that fewer businesses in 2017 consider cybersecurity to be of ""very low priority"". It said 74% now agreed it was a high priority issue for senior management.
The report also highlighted some unusual cybersecurity cases.
It said a large materials supplier for the construction industry faced ""significant and ongoing"" attacks, despite not having any e-commerce activities of its own.
""This included over 3,000 phishing emails a month and various ransomware attacks,"" the report noted.
Phishing is a form of cyber-attack in which emails with malicious links or attachments are disguised as genuine.
The most damaging case of ransomware at the firm in question caused its IT team to lose ""around two weeks"" of productivity.
Since then, the business has reviewed its cybersecurity policies.",Yes

Experts at computer security company Kaspersky Lab warned that the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) site had been compromised.
It is believed the malicious software could be used to spy on visitors.
Technical evidence suggests the hackers carried out previous cyber-attacks on human rights groups in Asia.
Tibet.net is the official website of the CTA, which is based in Dharamshala, northern India.
The organisation's spiritual leader is the 14th Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed anti-Chinese uprising, and set up a government-in-exile. China considers the Dalai Lama a separatist threat.
Kaspersky says the CTA website has been under constant attack from the same group of hackers since 2011, but previous breaches have been quietly identified and repaired before attracting significant attention.
Other Tibetan organisations, such as the International Campaign for Tibet, have also been targeted.
Kaspersky Lab researcher Kurt Baumgartner says the hackers used a method known as a ""watering-hole attack"".
A security bug in Oracle's Java software might have been exploited, giving hackers a ""back door"" into browsers' computers.
""This is the initial foothold,"" Mr Baumgartner said. ""From there they can download arbitrary files and execute them on the system.""
Kaspersky's education manager Ram Herkanaidu said the discovery of the attack came after an ""email account of a prominent Tibetan activist was hacked"".
Mr Herkanaidu added: ""The likely actors behind the sustained campaign against Tibetan sites are Chinese speaking, as in many cases we have seen log files written in Chinese.""",Yes
597,86,spyware,Company directors targeted by identity fraudsters,15 June 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40286280,"Company directors are the victims of one in five cases of identity fraud, according to fraud prevention organisation Cifas.
They account for 19% of victims of these type of fraud cases, despite making up less than 9% of the UK population.
Directors have been targeted directly by scams owing to the potential for con-artists to steal large sums.
Fraud victims are most likely to be aged between 31 and 50, Cifas said.
However, the biggest rise in 2016 from the previous year was among those aged 21 and under.
The report, by Cifas and LexisNexis Risk Solutions, also warned that fraudsters were attempting to obtain credit files as a pre-cursor to committing identity fraud.
Some 47% of recorded identity frauds involving fraudulently obtained credit files from company directors took place in London and the South East of England. In comparison, Wales and the North East of England each accounted for 2% of these fraud cases.
The vast majority of identity fraud takes place when a fraudster pretends to be an individual, so as to buy a product or take out a loan in their name.
Fraudsters get hold of the necessary personal material by stealing mail, computer hacking, obtaining data on the dark web, and exploiting personal information on social media, according to Cifas.
They can also gather it though social engineering, where people give up personal information to someone pretending to be from their bank, the police or a retailer.
Cifas advises people to shred important paper documents - and use passwords, privacy settings and anti-virus software on their computers.

598,87,spyware,Jamal Khashoggi: Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad',19 October 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45906396,"Turkish media have named 15 Saudi nationals who Turkish officials suspect were involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist critical of the government who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in the city of Istanbul on 2 October.
Most of the men flew into Istanbul on two private jets hours before Mr Khashoggi arrived at the consulate to collect some routine paperwork, and flew back to Riyadh later in the day on the same jets.
Turkish officials believe the men are Saudi officials and intelligence officers, an allegation that appears to be supported by open source information that is freely available.
Saudi authorities deny any involvement in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. They insist he left the consulate soon after getting the paperwork.
Dr Tubaigy is a forensic pathologist who completed a master's degree at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, and in 2015 he spent three months at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Australia.
The doctor identifies himself on his Twitter account as a professor of forensic medicine and head of the Saudi Scientific Council of Forensics. The account also links to the Saudi interior ministry.
In 2014 the London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq al-Awsat said Dr Tubaigy was a lieutenant colonel working for the forensic science department of the interior ministry's General Directorate of Public Security.
In an interview, accompanied by a photograph of him wearing uniform, the doctor discussed a mobile laboratory that he had designed to allow pathologists to perform post-mortems in only seven minutes in order to quickly determine the cause of death of Muslims performing the Hajj pilgrimage.
Turkish officials have also said that Dr Tubaigy was carrying a bone saw when he flew into Istanbul Ataturk Airport from Riyadh at 03:13 on 2 October on a private jet with the tail number HZSK2. The jet is owned by Sky Prime Aviation Services, a company that was reportedly seized by the Saudi government in an anti-corruption drive last year.
Dr Tubaigy stayed at a MÃ¶venpick Hotel Istanbul, 0.5km (0.3 miles) west of the Saudi consulate, and departed Istanbul airport on HZSK2 at 22:54 on 2 October. The jet returned to Riyadh via Dubai, landing late on 3 October.
Unnamed Turkish officials have since alleged that Dr Tubaigy can be heard in audio recordings from inside the consulate on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance, when they believe the journalist was tortured, killed and dismembered by the Saudi team who flew into the country.
A man identified as the doctor can be heard recommending that other people join him in listening to music on headphones while he cuts up Mr Khashoggi's body, according to the officials.
Dr Tubaigy has not commented. But a man who said he was the doctor's uncle tweeted that he would never carry out ""such criminal acts"".
Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London. A document published by the British government in 2007 listed a man with that name as first secretary.
A surveillance source confirmed to the BBC his identity as ""an intelligence security operative"", having met him in 2011 and trained him in how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state.
The spyware trainers nicknamed Mr Mutreb ""dark face"", the source said, ""because he looked always grumpy... he was very silent.""
CNN cited a Saudi source in London who knew Mr Mutreb as describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence, while the popular Arabic app MenoM3ay - which enables users to see the names people have linked to phone numbers - lists a man with that name as a colonel in the royal court.
Photographs also show that he has travelled abroad with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on at least three occasions since March 2018, suggesting he may have had a security role.
The Turkish pro-government newspaper Sabah also published pictures from CCTV footage that appeared to show Mr Mutreb entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul at 09:55 on 2 October, just over three hours before the journalist arrived, and at the nearby consul-general's residence at 16:53.
Turkish media said Mr Mutreb arrived in Istanbul on the private jet HZSK2 along with Dr Tubaigy, and also stayed at the MÃ¶venpick hotel.
He flew out of Istanbul on another private jet owned by Sky Prime Aviation with the tail number HZSK1, at 18:40 on 2 October, according to Turkish media.

599,88,spyware,"China Uighurs: Detained for beards, veils and internet browsing",17 February 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51520622,"A document that appears to give the most powerful insight yet into how China determined the fate of hundreds of thousands of Muslims held in a network of internment camps has been seen by the BBC.
Listing the personal details of more than 3,000 individuals from the far western region of Xinjiang, it sets out in intricate detail the most intimate aspects of their daily lives.
The painstaking records - made up of 137 pages of columns and rows - include how often people pray, how they dress, whom they contact and how their family members behave.
China denies any wrongdoing, saying it is combating terrorism and religious extremism.
The document is said to have come, at considerable personal risk, from the same source inside Xinjiang that leaked a batch of highly sensitive material published last year.
One of the world's leading experts on China's policies in Xinjiang, Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, believes the latest leak is genuine.
""This remarkable document presents the strongest evidence I've seen to date that Beijing is actively persecuting and punishing normal practices of traditional religious beliefs,"" he says.
One of the camps mentioned in it, the ""Number Four Training Centre"" has been identified by Dr Zenz as among those visited by the BBC as part of a tour organised by the Chinese authorities in May last year.
Much of the evidence uncovered by the BBC team appears to be corroborated by the new document, redacted for publication to protect the privacy of those included in it.
It contains details of the investigations into 311 main individuals, listing their backgrounds, religious habits, and relationships with many hundreds of relatives, neighbours and friends.
Verdicts written in a final column decide whether those already in internment should remain or be released, and whether some of those previously released need to return.
It is evidence that appears to directly contradict China's claim that the camps are merely schools.
In an article analysing and verifying the document, Dr Zenz argues that it also offers a far deeper understanding of the real purpose of the system.
It allows a glimpse inside the minds of those making the decisions, he says, laying bare the ""ideological and administrative micromechanics"" of the camps.
Row 598 contains the case of a 38-year-old woman with the first name Helchem, sent to a re-education camp for one main reason: she was known to have worn a veil some years ago.
It is just one of a number of cases of arbitrary, retrospective punishment.
Others were interned simply for applying for a passport - proof that even the intention to travel abroad is now seen as a sign of radicalisation in Xinjiang.
In row 66, a 34-year-old man with the first name Memettohti was interned for precisely this reason, despite being described as posing ""no practical risk"".
And then there's the 28-year-old man Nurmemet in row 239, put into re-education for ""clicking on a web-link and unintentionally landing on a foreign website"".
Again, his case notes describe no other issues with his behaviour.
The 311 main individuals listed are all from Karakax County, close to the city of Hotan in southern Xinjiang, an area where more than 90% of the population is Uighur.
Predominantly Muslim, the Uighurs are closer in appearance, language and culture to the peoples of Central Asia than to China's majority ethnicity, the Han Chinese.
In recent decades the influx of millions of Han settlers into Xinjiang has led to rising ethnic tensions and a growing sense of economic exclusion among Uighurs.
Those grievances have sometimes found expression in sporadic outbreaks of violence, fuelling a cycle of increasingly harsh security responses from Beijing.
It is for this reason that the Uighurs have become the target - along with Xinjiang's other Muslim minorities, like the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz - of the campaign of internment.
The ""Karakax List"", as Dr Zenz calls the document, encapsulates the way the Chinese state now views almost any expression of religious belief as a signal of disloyalty.
To root out that perceived disloyalty, he says, the state has had to find ways to penetrate deep into Uighur homes and hearts.
In early 2017, when the internment campaign began in earnest, groups of loyal Communist Party workers, known as ""village-based work teams"", began to rake through Uighur society with a massive dragnet.
With each member assigned a number of households, they visited, befriended and took detailed notes about the ""religious atmosphere"" in the homes; for example, how many Korans they had or whether religious rites were observed.
The Karakax List appears to be the most substantial evidence of the way this detailed information gathering has been used to sweep people into the camps.
It reveals, for example, how China has used the concept of ""guilt by association"" to incriminate and detain whole extended family networks in Xinjiang.
For every main individual, the 11th column of the spreadsheet is used to record their family relationships and their social circle.
Alongside each relative or friend listed is a note of their own background; how often they pray, whether they've been interned, whether they've been abroad.
In fact, the title of the document makes clear that the main individuals listed all have a relative currently living overseas - a category long seen as a key indicator of potential disloyalty, leading to almost certain internment.
Rows 179, 315 and 345 contain a series of assessments for a 65-year-old man, Yusup.
His record shows two daughters who ""wore veils and burkas in 2014 and 2015"", a son with Islamic political leanings and a family that displays ""obvious anti-Han sentiment"".
His verdict is ""continued training"" - one of a number of examples of someone interned not just for their own actions and beliefs, but for those of their family.
The information collected by the village teams is also fed into Xinjiang's big data system, called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP).
The IJOP contains the region's surveillance and policing records, culled from a vast network of cameras and the intrusive mobile spyware every citizen is forced to download.
The IJOP, Dr Zenz suggests, can in turn use its AI brain to cross-reference these layers of data and send ""push notifications"" to the village teams to investigate a particular individual.
The man found ""unintentionally landing on a foreign website"" may well have been interned thanks to the IJOP.
In many cases though, there is little need for advanced technology, with the vast and vague catch-all term ""untrustworthy"" appearing multiple times in the document.
It is listed as the sole reason for the internment of a total of 88 individuals.
The concept, Dr Zenz argues, is proof that the system is designed not for those who have committed a crime, but for an entire demographic viewed as potentially suspicious.
China  says Xinjiang has policies that ""respect and ensure people's freedom of religious belief"". It also insists that what it calls a ""vocational training programme in Xinjiang"" is ""for the purposes of combating terrorism and religious extremism"", adding only people who have been convicted of crimes involving terrorism or religious extremism are being ""educated"" in these centres.
However, many of the cases in the Karakax List give multiple reasons for internment; various combinations of religion, passport, family, contacts overseas or simply being untrustworthy.
The most frequently listed is for violating China's strict family planning laws.
In the eyes of the Chinese authorities it seems, having too many children is the clearest sign that Uighurs put their loyalty to culture and tradition above obedience to the secular state.
China has long defended its actions in Xinjiang as part of an urgent response to the threat of extremism and terrorism.
The Karakax List does contain some references to those kinds of crimes, with at least six entries for preparing, practicing or instigating terrorism and two cases of watching illegal videos.
But the broader focus of those compiling the document appears to be faith itself, with more than 100 entries describing the ""religious atmosphere"" at home.
The Karakax List has no stamps or other authenticating marks so, at face value, it is difficult to verify.
It is thought to have been passed out of Xinjiang sometime before late June last year, along with a number of other sensitive papers.
They ended up in the hands of an anonymous Uighur exile who passed all of them on, except for this one document.
Only after the first batch was published last year was the Karakax List then forwarded to his conduit, another Uighur living in Amsterdam, Asiye Abdulaheb.
She told the BBC that she is certain it is genuine.
""Regardless of whether there are official stamps on the document or not, this is information about real, live people,"" she says. ""It is private information about people that wouldn't be made public. So there is no way for the Chinese government to claim it is fake.""
Like all Uighurs living overseas, Ms Abdulaheb lost contact with her family in Xinjiang when the internment campaign began, and she's been unable to contact them since.
But she says she had no choice but to release the document, passing it to a group of international media organisations, including the BBC.
""Of course I am worried about the safety of my relatives and friends,"" she says. ""But if everyone keeps silent because they want to protect themselves and their families, then we will never prevent these crimes being committed.""
At the end of last year China announced that everyone in its ""vocational training centres"" had now ""graduated"". However, it also suggested some may stay open for new students on the basis of their ""free will"".
Almost 90% of the 311 main individuals in the Karakax List are shown as having already been released or as being due for release on completion of a full year in the camps.
But Dr Zenz points out that the re-education camps are just one part of a bigger system of internment, much of which remains hidden from the outside world.
More than two dozen individuals are listed as ""recommended"" for release into ""industrial park employment"" - career ""advice"" that they may have little choice but to obey. There are well documented concerns that China is now building a system of coerced labour as the next phase of its plan to align Uighur life with its own vision of a modern society.
In two cases, the re-education ends in the detainees being sent to ""strike hard detention"", a reminder that the formal prison system has been cranked into overdrive in recent years.
Many of the family relationships listed in the document show long prison terms for parents or siblings, sometimes for entirely normal religious observances and practices.
One man's father is shown to have been sentenced to five years for ""having a double-coloured thick beard and organising a religious studies group"".
A neighbour is reported to have been given 15 years for ""online contact with people overseas"", and another man's younger brother given 10 years for ""storing treasonable pictures on his phone"".
Whether or not China has closed its re-education camps in Xinjiang, Dr Zenz says the Karakax List tells us something important about the psychology of a system that prevails.
""It reveals the witch-hunt-like mindset that has been and continues to dominate social life in the region,"" he said.",Yes
600,89,spyware,Cyber attacks: Two-thirds of big UK businesses targeted,8 May 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36239805,"Two-thirds of big UK businesses have been hit by a cyber attack in the past year, according to government research.
Most of the attacks involved viruses, spyware or malware, the Cyber Security Breaches Survey says. A quarter of large firms experiencing a cyber breach did so at least once a month.
Digital Economy Minister Ed Vaizey said it was ""absolutely crucial businesses are secure and can protect data"".
In some cases the internet-linked attacks cost millions of pounds.
The survey's results have been released alongside the government's Cyber Governance Health Check, launched following the TalkTalk cyber attack in October last year.
The phone and broadband provider, which has over four million UK customers, said some of their banking details and personal information could have been accessed in the breach.
In light of these surveys, businesses are now being urged to protect themselves better.
Mr Vaizey said: ""The UK is a world-leading digital economy and this government has made cyber security a top priority.
""Too many firms are losing money, data and consumer confidence with the vast number of cyber attacks. It's absolutely crucial businesses are secure and can protect data.""
The survey also suggested seven out of 10 attacks could have been prevented, and added that only a fifth of businesses understand the dangers of sharing information with third parties.
The government is investing Â£1.9bn over the next five years to tackle and prevent cyber crime, and a new National Cyber Security Centre will offer security support.
Also, a national cyber security strategy will be published later this year, setting out proposals to improve online security for the government, among businesses and for consumers.",Yes

In a Washington State lawsuit, Indian firm iYogi is accused of using scare tactics to mislead consumers.
It is also accused of falsely claiming affiliation to Microsoft, Apple and HP.
The firm has denied the allegations, describing them as ""false"" and ""baseless"".
""While we are yet to receive the complaint through formal channels, based on our assessment of media reports we would like to firmly state that the allegations are false or baseless,"" said iYogi's co-founder Vishal Dhar in a statement to the BBC.
""We recognise that tech support frauds are a real issue in the US and, as a responsible industry leader, we have been working with authorities... to counter the issue.""
He said that his firm would ""do what is necessary"" to see the case through ""to its rightful end"".
Attorney General Bob Ferguson alleged that ""hundreds, if not thousands"" of Washington residents had been affected by what he described as iYogi's ""unfair and deceptive"" tactics, which he claimed violated Washington's consumer protection and computer spyware laws.
He is seeking $2,000 (Â£1,340) in civil penalties for each violation of the Consumer Protection Act and $100,000 per violation for the Computer Spyware Act.
Microsoft's chief legal officer Brad Smith attended a news conference announcing the lawsuit and applauded the state for its efforts to ""protect consumers from tech support scams that have reached epidemic levels in recent years"".
He said that his firm had received more than 180,000 customer calls regarding tech support fraud.
Microsoft estimates that 3.3 million Americans lose about $1.5bn annually from tech support scams.
Such scams tended to disproportionately affect ""the most vulnerable segments of our society"", he said, adding that tech support scams ""have become a scourge on the internet"".
iYogi has more than 5,000 employees based at call centres in India. It says it serves more than three million customers across 11 countries.
As part of its investigation the Attorney General's Office (AGO) alleged that iYogi used the following tactics:
The AGO also offered advice to avoid tech support scams:

A recent Office of National Statistics survey suggested there are 5.4 million fraud and computer misuse cases a year.
Other findings include:
Which said that it could not explain why certain frauds occur more in some areas rather than others, partly because so many fraud cases go unreported so the data is incomplete.
There were 264,204 frauds reported to Action Fraud in 2016 but this is likely to be a fraction of those that occur.
Which's report did suggest that certain demographics are targeted by different scams  - so, for example, fake computer fixes tend to focus on elderly women living in rural areas.
Members of the public can click on an interactive map to find out the most commonly occurring fraud in their county.
Gareth Shaw, Which? money expert, thinks there is little doubt that online fraud is on the rise: ""This research highlights how reported fraud in the UK is on the increase and the kinds of scams you are most likely to fall victim to will depend on where you live.
""These criminals are constantly finding new ways to rip us off and those tackling fraud should be upping their game. The government needs to set out an ambitious agenda to tackle fraud, while law enforcement agencies need to be working harder to identify and protect the people most at risk from fraud.""
Commander Dave Clark, City of London Police, National Co-ordinator for Economic Crime said: ""Fraud and cyber crime are global problems with many of the offenders targeting UK citizens from overseas,""

Ms Sinclaire, who denies misconduct in public office between 1 October 2009 and 31 July 2010, while a serving MEP, is on trial at Birmingham Crown Court.
She also denies claims that between 14 October 2009 and 31 December 2010 she fraudulently transferred criminal property into her bank account.
The court heard from barrister Sean Hammond, representing Ms Sinclaire, that there was a ""background of hostility"" between his client and Mr Farage.
The defence said Mr Ison was treated by Ms Sinclaire as a ""confidant"" when she was trying to gain entry to the party's national executive committee in 2010, shortly after having lost the party whip.
However, the court was told Mr Ison worked to ""undermine"" her, then sought to exploit confusion over the European expenses system as a back-up tactic.
Mr Ison denied the claims.

605,94,spyware,'Lover Spy' hacker makes FBI 'most wanted' list,8 November 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24868420,"A man who allegedly created malware purporting to catch out cheating lovers has made it on to the FBI's ""most wanted"" list of cybercriminals.
The FBI says Carlos Enrique Perez-Melara ran a website offering customers a way to ""catch a cheating lover"" by sending spyware masquerading as a greeting card.
Opening the card downloaded the malware on to the recipient's computer and recorded keystrokes and messages.
The ""Lover Spy"" program cost $89 (Â£55).
Mr Perez-Melara was indicted in July 2005 but has avoided capture ever since, only now making it on to the FBI's most wanted list.
He ran the operation from his San Diego home in 2003, the FBI says, while he was in the US on a student travel visa.
The charges against Mr Perez-Melara, 33, included making, sending and advertising an interception device, and unlawfully intercepting electronic communications.
The indictment said Lover Spy was designed ""with stealth in mind, claiming that it would be impossible to detect by 99.9% of users"".
But Mr Perez-Melara has avoided the authorities ever since and his last known location was San Salvador, the FBI said.
The agency appears to have added the hacker to its list partly out of frustration at his elusiveness.
""These are sophisticated folks who know how to hide themselves on the internet,'' said John Brown, who oversees the FBI's cyber-division.
The agency has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.
According to the 2005 indictment, Mr Perez-Melara sold the malware to 1,000 customers, who then used it to infect the computers of about 2,000 victims.

606,95,spyware,Poker players targeted by card-watching malware,18 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34289003,"Online poker players are being targeted by a computer virus that spies on their virtual cards.
The software shares the cards with the virus's creators who then join the same game and try to fleece the victim.
The sneaky malware has been found lurking in software designed to help poker fans play better, said the security firm that found it.
The software also targets other useful information on a victim's computer such as login names and passwords.
The malware targets players of the Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker sites, said Robert Lipovsky, a security researcher at Eset, in a blogpost.
When it infects a machine, the software monitors the PC's activity and springs to life when a victim has logged in to either one of the two poker sites. It then starts taking screenshots of their activity and the cards they are dealt. Screenshots are then sent to the attacker.
The images show the hand the player has been dealt as well as their player ID. This, said Eset, allows the attacker to search the sites for that player and join their game. Using information about a victim's hand gives the attacker a significant advantage.
""We are unsure whether the perpetrator plays the games manually or in some automated way,"" wrote Mr Lipovsky.
Eset found the Windows malware lurking in some well-known file-sharing applications, PC utilities as well as several widely used poker calculators and player databases.
Eset said the spyware had been active for several months and most victims were in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia and the Ukraine.",Yes
607,96,spyware,Who are the hackers who cracked the iPhone?,31 August 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37192670,"What do we know about the curious, secretive NSO Group? Very little - but after this week, an awful lot more than we did before.
The group, an Israeli-based but American-owned company, specialises in creating what it calls tools against crime and terrorism. But the security researchers call them something else: a cyber arms dealer.
On Thursday, the NSO Group was thrust into international headlines after being credited with creating malicious software capable of ""jailbreaking"" any iPhone with just one tap of the screen, and then installing vicious spyware.
Security-savvy human rights lawyer Ahmed Mansoor found himself targeted by the attack when his iPhone received a message promising ""secrets"" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates.
Had he tapped on the link, the phone would have been plundered. Huge amounts of private data: text messages, photos, emails, location data, even whatâs being picked up by the deviceâs microphone and camera.
Thankfully, he didn't do that. Instead, he passed on the message to experts at Citizen Lab and Lookout, who peeled back the covers on what they described as one of the most sophisticated cyber weapons ever discovered. With it came evidence that it was the NSO Groupâs expertise at the heart of it all.
Earlier this year, UK-based watchdog Privacy International launched a database tracking the global trade of cyber arms. Its intention was to track deals between cyber arms companies and governments.
According to the Surveillance Industry Index (SII), the NSO Group was founded in 2010 and is based in Herzliya, an attractive city north of Tel Aviv that is known as being a cluster of tech start-ups. The group was likely funded by the elite 8200 Intelligence Unit, an Israeli military-funded scheme for start-ups.
According to Forbes, the 8200 Intelligence Unit was heavily involved in providing expertise and funding for Stuxnet, a cyber attack on Iran that was a joint operation between the US and Israel.
Listed in the SSI were multi-million dollar deals made between the NSO Group and government entities in Mexico and Panama. This is the tip of the iceberg - âpress reports of sales rely on leaks and anonymous sources, and so there are likely many more unknown to the general public.
In 2015, the NSO Groupâs owners - âUS-based venture capital firm Francisco Partnersâ - were looking to sell the company at a value of around $1bn. Neither firm has responded to the BBCâs requests for further comment.
That the NSO Group sells tools to governments is no secretâ - âin a statement released in response to claims it was behind the attack on Mr Mansoor, NSO Group spokesman Zamir Dahbash said: ""The company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations.""
But the company has gone no further than that in describing who its customers are, and what exactly they buy. It does say it has no control over how its tools are used and for what purpose.
Whatever the origin of the NSO Group, what has been created is an extraordinarily talented team of cyber specialists.
The attack on Mr Mansoor, had it worked, would have utilised not one but three zero day attacks. A ""zero day"" is a term given to vulnerabilities that were previously unknown to the security industry, and are therefore wide open to attack. To discover one zero day is rare, to find three is outstanding.
Clues to the origin of the attack came when the experts looked at the messages Mr Mansoor received. A link was included to a web domain known to point to servers set up by the NSO Group for its customers.
When the researchers analysed the spywareâs code, they noticed apparent references to ""Pegasus"", the name given, by the NSO Group, to one of its spying products.
Details about Pegasus were made public last year when another cyber arms firm, called the Hacking Team, was itself breached. Material used to market Pegasus was subsequently leaked.
When Apple was made aware of the vulnerabilities in its iPhone, it acted quickly, patching the problem in 10 days and pushing out an update to all of its users. That has neutralised this specific attack, sure, but there'll likely be many more that remain hidden from view.
In a rare interview with Defense News, the NSO Groupâs co-founder, Omri Lavie, said their attacks would ""leave no trace"".
Thanks to the quick thinking of Mr Mansoor, and the forensic efforts of researchers, the group has been temporarily dragged into the limelight - but it will only be for a brief moment. Soon the NSO Group  will rejoin the rest of the money-spinning cyber arms trade back in the shadows.

And they appear to be working. Internet security firm Kaspersky estimates the malicious software has been downloaded around 10,000 times.
One of the tricks involves promoting videos claiming to be of victims injured in recent attacks by the Assad regime. When attempting to download the clips from file sharing sites, rogue software is downloaded as well, which could give hackers access to the computer. If successful, they can record keystrokes, obtain passwords, and record online phone calls. Another piece of bait used is a letter which purports to be between Syrian military units detailing forthcoming chemical attacks.
Other methods include posting messages on Facebook encouraging users to protect themselves from government attacks by installing ""Ammazon Internet Security"" software - a fake anti-virus programme designed to compromise the user's machine.
David Emm works for Kaspersky Lab, an internet security firm that produced a report about the attacks.  ""It's social engineering. It's aimed at people who would be shocked or angered by what's been posted,"" he tells BBC Trending. Although it is impossible to be certain they are the work of the Syrian Electronic Army, there are clues that suggest they are involved. As well as the nature of the content itself, the spyware is passing information back to a server with an IP address provided by the TARASSUL, as ISP associated with the Syrian government.
Once infiltrated, the machines can be used to collect intelligence, and disrupt opposition networks. Emm says the attacks are likely to become both more prolific and more sophisticated as the conflict continues.
Social networks have played a huge role in the Syrian conflict to date. Government regulated news broadcasts have pushed many people online in a search for more information. Social media has been used for everything from breaking news, to documenting battles, and fundraising for opposition forces.

609,98,spyware,South Korea spy kills himself amid hacking scandal,19 July 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33584699,"An employee of South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) spying agency has been found dead in his car after apparently taking his own life on a mountain road, police say.
His death comes as a scandal over phone-hacking gathers pace.
The man left a suicide note admitting that he had deleted important information about the hacking.
It has emerged that mobile phones were tracked and monitored just before the presidential election in 2012.
Government and NIS officials have denied opposition claims that the spyware - bought from an Italian company - was used to monitor South Koreans in general.
They insist that its purpose was to boost the country's cyber-warfare capabilities against North Korea.
The BBC's Stephen Evans, in South Korea, says that the note left by the dead man implies that phones were monitored only to keep tabs on people connected to North Korea and not to besmirch opponents of the right-of-centre president.
The spy agency had a scandalous reputation in the years before South Korea embraced democracy in the 1980s, and was involved in abductions and killings.
The modern NIS is not accused of such serious offences but has nevertheless been embroiled in several scandals, including election meddling.
Opposition politicians allege that it is not politically neutral, breaks the law and is a political tool for sitting presidents.
Last week the Supreme Court ordered a review of the conviction of former NIS head Won Sei-hoon, who was sentenced to three years in jail in February for trying to influence the results of the 2012 presidential election.",Yes

611,100,spyware,Therexit: The economic fallout,24 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-48402357,"When a corporate chief executive quits, it's sometimes worth a look at the share price. A sharp rise suggests that the boss was holding back the company, and an exit was overdue: a fall indicates that investors saw the boss's presence as an important part of its future.
So how did the market react to Theresa May's announcement? By doing nothing much. The pound weakened 0.25% against the US dollar. The FTSE250 edged up.
That is partly because investors had already priced in her departure. They could see she wasn't going to cut a deal that got the government through Brexit, so assumed she would be resigning before long.
And with her gone, they can also see - as we all can - that there's little alternative route out of the political impasse under any other Conservative prime minister.
Meanwhile, there are other factors at play in the markets which give a better explanation of recent fluctuations, including the ramping up of a trans-Pacific trade war between the US and China.
Just ahead of the announcement, the latest retail figures were issued by the Office for National Statistics, showing the volume of goods sold up by 5.2% year on year. The value was flat, after a very strong first quarter.
Add to that an unemployment rate at a 44-year low, and employment at record levels, and you can see the economic record while Theresa May was in Downing Street wasn't so bad at all. If she had focused on that, there might have been a less tearful conclusion to her time in office.
But the economy was never, personally, her main interest or strong point. It was a factor within the overarching determination to push through Brexit, but it was treated as if it were dispensable or an after-thought. For some, it could be compromised in the endeavour to placate those who saw the return of sovereignty as being of more value than the diminished growth rate which most economists reckon would follow.
In the turmoil within her cabinet, it was left to the minority of ministers with economic portfolios to remind colleagues of the potential damage to businesses and the economy. Phillip Hammond, as chancellor of the exchequer, and Greg Clark as business secretary, often cut lonely figures in making that case.
Under May's leadership, a gulf opened up between the Conservatives and big business, which has been causing alarm to both sides of that relationship.
Business lobbies have become increasingly frustrated that the internal Conservative debate about Brexit has been carried on with little reference to their warnings, which have been particularly strong about the potential damage of ""no deal"".
When the CBI director-general visited Edinburgh recently, for a lunch with members, the guest speaker was due to be Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell.
He didn't make it to the Scottish capital due to the (doomed) Brexit talks with the government. But the invitation was a sign that the business lobby is turning its attention (with quite a lot of alarm) to the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour taking power.
The common message to all those reacting to the Therexit of Mrs May is that it doesn't change the arithmetic or provide a solution. Indeed, it prolongs the uncertainty, and introduces the risk of a harder-line Brexiteer pushing for departure without a deal.
The Institute of Directors, with a gently mocking tone, repeats the prime minister's words when she had a botched double launch of her long term care policy during that disastrous election campaign in 2017.
""Nothing has changed,"" says the IoD boss. ""At least not much. A new leader will be faced with the same political challenges and the same economic realities. No deal remains a significant and growing concern for businesses and that cannot be wished away, whoever is in power.
""When companies and the country need serious, considered decision-making, we have pantomime instead.""
According to Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, Theresa May ""leaves office with the respect of business"".
""But her resignation must be now be a catalyst for change,"" she added. ""There can be no plan for Britain without a plan for Brexit.
""Winner takes all politics is not working. Jobs and livelihoods are at stake. Business and the country need honesty. Nation must be put ahead of party, prosperity ahead of politics. Compromise and consensus must re-find their voice in Parliament"".
A similar message came from Liz Cameron at the Scottish Chambers of Commerce: ""We now urge political leaders to put country before personal ambitions, to ensure focus remains on solving the Brexit riddle.
""Westminster has already squandered far too much time going around in circles. They must realise that lack of direction has real-world economic consequences, causing the collapse of business confidence, which has a deleterious impact on investments and jobs.""
Some changes to economic policy under Theresa May's premiership are worth noting. She pulled back on George Osborne's focus on the Northern Powerhouse in the north of England. An industrial policy was being developed.
The government dolloped money into growth sectors where it saw strategic interest. But this was submerged by the battle to protect sectors, such as car-making and steel, that are particularly vulnerable to Brexit disruption. And in recent weeks, the need to open trade out beyond the European Union tripped up over the Pacific trade war.
The Downing Street cabinet was split between welcoming Chinese telecoms technology (the prime minister's preference), and supporting the American case that Huawei carries too much potential as spyware. Being a much smaller trading power than the EU, and with trade deals to be done, expect more similar dilemmas.
As chancellor, Phillip Hammond dialled back on the austerity rhetoric, and pushed back his predecessor's target date for reaching a surplus.
While the Whitehall welfare budget continued to see big cuts, the biggest of them through the freeze on working-age benefits, the flow of funds to the National Health Service was increased.
And what of the future? Apart from the dominant question of Brexit, and how to make it happen, the next Conservative leader will have the opportunity to re-shuffle the cabinet, putting different people into the economic ministries, and shifting economic policy.
My hunch is that there won't be enormous change, because there isn't the time, government headspace or political capital to do much beyond Brexit.
But one factor to watch is immigration. Theresa May has had a stranglehold on immigration policy for nine years since she became home secretary. It was on that that she placed her reputation for toughness. She gave us the policy of making a ""hostile environment"" for those facing deportation, meanwhile blundering into the Windrush fiasco, of excluding long-time residents of the UK who had been invited 60 years ago from the Caribbean to fill labour market gaps.
Mrs May shut out new thinking about how to handle immigration. Behind the Leave majority, it played a significant part. Even for the six years before that vote, her response to public opinion about it was to set an unrealistic target for reducing net migration to below 100,000 and then to stick to it, while deaf to unintended consequences - for instance, on overseas student recruitment.
The rest of the cabinet has sometimes been infuriated by Mrs May's intransigence on this when she was home secretary. Now in that role, Sajid Javid doesn't much care for the sub-100,000 target. In launching a consultation on post-Brexit immigration, he quietly dropped it.
That consultation features the question of what salary level should be set for an EU or non-EU national to get a work permit in Britain. The proposed level is Â£30,000, which business groups say is far too high to recruit the skilled staff they need in more junior roles.
The next Tory leader and prime minister is likely to want to take a more flexible approach than Theresa May. In Scotland, such a change would be welcomed across Holyrood's political spectrum, and by business lobbies.",Yes
612,1,ransomware,The ransomware surge ruining lives,14 hours ago,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56933733,"A global coalition of technology companies and law enforcement bodies is calling for ""aggressive and urgent"" action against ransomware.
Microsoft, Amazon, the FBI and the UK's National Crime Agency have joined the Ransomware Task Force (RTF) in giving governments nearly 50 recommendations.
Ransomware gangs are now routinely targeting schools and hospitals.
Hackers use malicious software to scramble and steal an organisation's computer data.
The RTF has submitted its report to President Biden's administration.
It argues that ""more than just money is at stake"" and says that, in just a few years, ""ransomware has become a serious national security threat and public health and safety concern"".
RTF co-chair Jen Ellis, from cyber-security company Rapid 7, says: ""Citizens are being impacted by this every day. It's having a huge impact on the economy and the ability for ordinary people to access critical services.
""Not only that but, really distressingly, the funds that come in from paid ransoms fund other forms of organised crime, like human trafficking and child exploitation.""
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, also a member of the Ransomware Task Force says it handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents in 2020 than in the previous year.
""It was a Sunday morning in October last year when I got a call about problems with our IT systems,"" says Rob Miller, director of information and communications technology for the London Borough of Hackney.
""It quickly became apparent that it was a serious cyber-attack.
""We had to lock everything down and switch off the internet for all of our systems. We have services running 24/7 for nearly 300,000 residents, and it felt huge and really worrying.
""We knew that there was a huge challenge ahead of us, and the whole council had to pull together across all departments to get key services back up and running as quickly as possible.
""The damage done was really significant with things like housing repairs, benefits payments and land registry all impacted.
""It's going to be months until we're fully recovered, and I can't understand the motivation behind this for the criminals.
""You sit there and look at the impact on local communities especially in a time of a pandemic.
""I can't imagine anyone who would think it is OK to cause that much damage to services at a time like that. It's hard to comprehend.""
The secrecy and stigma associated with ransomware attacks makes it extremely difficult to calculate a true picture of the number of attacks and costs.
The FBI says that nearly 2,400 US companies, local governments, healthcare facilities and schools were victims of ransomware in the last year.
RTF researchers confirmed hundreds of major attacks took place around the world last year, including in the UK, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, India, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
Cyber-security company Emsisoft estimates that the true global cost of ransomware, including business interruption and ransom payments in 2020, was a minimum of $42bn (Â£30bn) and a maximum of nearly $170bn.
A survey by Veritas Technologies found that 66% of victims admitted to paying part or all of the ransom.
The RTF is recommending that governments make it mandatory for victims to report if they do pay criminals.
""I couldn't believe it when we were hacked,"" says Martin Kelterborn, chief executive of Offix Group in Aarburg, Switzerland, which was attacked in May 2019.
""I went into my IT department and the manager was pale and clearly shocked. He told me everything had gone. We watched live as all our product pictures for our websites were encrypted one after the other.
""I had 230 employees coming to me asking what to do. We had tens of thousands of orders, but no computer systems to sort through them.
""At one point me and my boss actually wrote a press release declaring that the company was dead and out of business. They were the worst three weeks of my life.
""The hackers were the Ryuk ransomware gang and they demanded we pay them 45 Bitcoin, which was about half a million dollars.
""Yes we did consider paying, but in the end they actually destroyed so much of our system that we needed to rebuild anyway. Recovering has cost us about the same: half a million dollars.""
The RTF's other recommendations to governments include:
For years cyber-security organisations have alleged that ransomware gangs are operating openly in North Korea, Iran and Russia.
Earlier this month, the US government sanctioned multiple Russian entities saying that the Kremlin ""cultivates and co-opts criminal hackers, including the previously designated Evil Corp, enabling them to engage in disruptive ransomware attacks"".

615,4,ransomware,Cyber-attack hackers threaten to share US police informant data,27 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56898711,"Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department has said its computer network has been breached in a targeted cyber-attack, US media report.
A ransomware group called Babuk is reportedly threatening to release sensitive data on police informants if it is not contacted within three days.
The FBI is investigating the extent of the breach, US media reported, citing the Washington DC police department.
Ransomware is used to scramble computer networks and steal information.
Attackers target companies or organisations and can lock their systems, then demand large sums of money in return for ending the hack.
On Monday, Washington DC's police department said in a statement that it was ""aware of unauthorised access on our server"", AP news agency reported.
""While we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter,"" the statement added, without providing further details of the reported breach.
It is not clear if attackers managed to lock police out of their systems during the breach.
Babuk, a Russian-speaking ransomware group that emerged earlier this year, said it had downloaded ""a sufficient amount of information"" from the police department's internal networks, AP reports.
Screenshots said to have been posted by the group on the dark web and shared on social media appeared to suggest it had gained access to information on criminal gang activity and police intelligence reports.
The head of UK-based cyber-security consultancy Bridewell Consulting, James Smith, said a risk remained for companies and organisations even if a ransom was paid.
""With these types of attacks, the data has probably been stolen already, before it was encrypted, and the likelihood that the data will be sold or stored by the hacker is great,"" he said in a statement to the BBC.
Earlier this month, Babuk reportedly targeted the Houston Rockets basketball team with ransomware and claimed to have accessed documents including player contracts and financial data.
A spokeswoman for the Houston Rockets, Tracey Hughes, said that while the group had accessed some information, it failed to install its ransomware because of a security system in place.

616,5,ransomware,Russian pleads guilty to Tesla ransomware plot,20 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56469475,"A Russian man in the US has pleaded guilty to plotting to extort money from the electric car company Tesla.
Egor Igorevich Kriuchkov is accused of offering an employee $1m (Â£721,000) to place ransomware in the computer network of the company's battery plant in Nevada.
He planned to use the ransomware to steal company secrets for extortion, prosecutors alleged.
The 27-year-old pleaded guilty on Thursday in Reno, Nevada.
Mr Kriuchkov acted on behalf of criminals abroad and tried to bribe a Tesla employee in person, prosecutors said.
Ransomware attacks companies or organisations by scrambling their internal computer networks, stealing information or locking users out. The attackers then demand large sums of money in return for ending the hack.
The FBI said the planned attack on Tesla was stopped before it could take place.
Mr Kriuchkov told a court in September that the Russian government was aware of the planned hack, but the FBI and lawyers have not alleged that there were ties to the Kremlin.
""The swift response of the company and the FBI prevented a major exfiltration of the victim company's data and stopped the extortion scheme at its inception,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas McQuaid said in a statement.
Mr Kruichokov was in the US for five weeks on a tourist visa in July and August last year when he tried to recruit the Tesla employee, according to court documents reported in US media.
He was quoted as saying that he and his co-conspirators would steal the data, and if Tesla refused to pay the ransom the company's secrets would be placed on the internet.
The US Department of Justice said that he took the employee out for drinks multiple times and gave him a phone. After the employee told Tesla about the plan, the company contacted the FBI who instructed the employee to record their conversations with Mr Kruichokov.
Mr Kruichokov faces up to ten months in prison after signing a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty, according to technology website The Record.",Yes
617,6,ransomware,Insurers defend covering ransomware payments,27 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55811165,"The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has defended the inclusion of ransomware payments in first-party cyber-insurance policies.
It said insurance was ""not an alternative"" to doing everything possible to first minimise the risk.
However, it added that firms could face financial ruin without the cover.
Prof Ciaran Martin, former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said the UK needed to rethink its policies on ransomware.
Ransomware is a form of malware in which infected computers are remotely locked by cyber-criminals, who then demand a ransom, often in the form of Bitcoin, to unlock them and return the data they hold.
There are many examples of businesses and public bodies which have chosen to pay because they do not have the data backed up, or cannot afford - or do not have time - to rebuild their systems from scratch.
The Guardian reported that Prof Martin, now at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government, said he believed insurers were ""funding organised crime"" by accepting ransomware claims, but he told the BBC the issue of how to tackle ransomware was far broader than just the insurance sector.
While official advice is not to pay the demand, it is not illegal to do so in the UK, he said.
""I have some sympathy with insurers, because as long as it's legal, there are incentives to pay.""
While the ransom demand may be high, the alternative impact can also be devastating.
When the global aluminium producer Norsk Hydro was attacked in 2019, it cost the firm around Â£45m, and its profits in the immediate aftermath plummeted by 82%, reported Reuters.
Norsk Hydro refused to pay the demand, which would arguably have been cheaper - but it did have insurance.
A spokesman for the ABI said insurers do require that ""reasonable precautions"" are taken to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding in the first place, just as cars and houses require security measures in place to deter thieves.
""Some might argue that any insurance that covers against a criminal act could lull the policyholder into a false sense of security,"" he said.
Prof Martin said he did not think that banning ransomware insurance claims would necessarily solve the problem.
""But it's worth a serious piece of consultation because if we continue as we are, things will get worse,"" he said.",Yes
618,7,ransomware,Cyberpunk 2077 makers CD Projekt hit by ransomware hack,9 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55994787,"The maker of popular video game Cyberpunk 2077 has been hacked in a ransomware attack.
CD Projekt Red said hackers had accessed its internal network, digitally scrambled some of its data servers and tried to blackmail it.
The perpetrators claim to have stolen source code for several of the firm's games which they said they would leak unless a payment was made.
But the Polish games company said it would not negotiate.
In a statement on Twitter, CD Projekt Red posted a copy of the ransom note which said the hackers had copied code from Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent, and Witcher 3, including an unreleased version of the latter.
âWe have also dumped all of your documents relating to accounting, administration legal, HR, investor relations and more!â the note added.
""Dumping"" means copying the information to an external source.
âIf we will not come to an agreement, then your source codes will be sold or leaked online and your documents will be sent to our contacts in gaming journalism,â read the note, giving a deadline of 48 hours.
Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program before it is transformed for use. Releasing it could make it easier for people to write hacks for the titles or even publish their own altered versions, as well as reveal some of their development secrets.
In a statement, posted by the game developers on Twitter, it said it has secured its âIT infrastructure and begun restoring the dataâ from back-ups.
âWe will not give in to the demands or negotiate with the actor,â it said, adding that no personal data had been compromised in the breach.
The company has informed law enforcement and data protection authorities, while it investigates the issue.
This is the latest in a series of bad news for the developers after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed several times, only for users to then experience glitches in the game.
""This will be frustrating for users of the game, but as consumers are generally very sympathetic when something like this happens,"" said Louise Shorthouse, senior gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis.
""This comes after a string of recent ransomware attacks on games companies, including Capcom and Ubisoft late last year.
""Fixes and updates for Cyberpunk 2077 may take a backseat for a while, as mitigating the effects of the ransomware attack becomes the priority.""
This probably couldn't have come at a worse time for the embattled games studio.
However, its response has been extraordinary and is already being praised by the cyber-security world.
In one Tweet, the company has demonstrated a new gold standard response to dealing with ransomware.
The company is being transparent about the attack but also says it is not negotiating with the cyber-criminals and instead relying on well-managed back-up systems.
CD Projekt Red has even released a screen grab of the ransom note which will be invaluable for researchers.
It doesn't sound like much and there will be questions about how the firm was able to be breached in the first place.
But in a world of empty press releases and companies secretly paying criminals huge ransoms, CD Projekt Red has shown what can and, in the eyes of many, should be done to deal with the growing problem of ransomware hacking.",Yes

The Mail on Sunday says Downing Street has launched a counter-attack against the former chief adviser, claiming his allies within Number 10 were responsible for what the paper calls ""nasty and sexist briefings"" against Boris Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds.
It also claims Mr Cummings is planning to accuse the PM of being so determined to resist a second lockdown last year that he would have tolerated a large number of deaths.
The Sunday Telegraph reports the government is growing increasingly worried by what information the former aide may reveal if he hands over a dossier of documents to a parliamentary committee. It quotes a Westminster insider, who claims the disclosure may also damage Chancellor Rishi Sunak by revealing his strong opposition to Covid restrictions being reintroduced.
The front page of the Daily Star features a cheeky offer to Mr Cummings, saying they'll pay him Â£1.25 to tell them everything he knows.
The Observer's leader says that the plausibility of Mr Cummings' claims demonstrate how ""dishonourable the prime minister has already revealed himself to be"", with the paper's chief political commentator Andrew Rawnsley predicting that the ongoing questions over the integrity of ministers will eventually prompt ""a day of reckoning"" at the ballot box.
In the Sunday Express, political commentator Patrick O'Flynn says the public are unlikely to turn on Mr Johnson when his willingness to break rules and govern in an unconventional manner is a major reason why many voted for him in 2019.

Quanta Computer is a manufacturer of many flagship Apple products, including its MacBook line.
The hackers, known as Revil, have published stolen blueprints for unreleased products, and are threatening to release more.
Taiwanese officials said they are ""taking an initial step to look into and understand"" the incident.
It is being handled by the Ministry of Justice's investigation bureau.
On their darknet website, the anonymous hackers are attempting to extort a ransom from Apple directly, writing: ""We recommended that Apple buy back available data by 1 May.""
It is understood they are asking for tens of millions of pounds.
How close the alleged blueprints will be to any actual future products is not clear. Bloomberg reports that the leaked materials include the schematics for a future MacBook laptop. The Guardian reports that a new Apple Watch is also among them.
Apple has not responded, but Quanta confirmed a cyber-attack had taken place.
In a press release, the company said: ""Quanta Computer's information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber-attacks on a small number of Quanta servers.
""We've reported to, and kept seamless communications with, the relevant law enforcement and data protection authorities concerning recent abnormal activities observed. There's no material impact on the company's business operation.""
The release of the hacked material came just hours before Apple's major product showcase event on Tuesday.
Revil said the timing was not a coincidence, writing that the data leak was ""in order not to wait for the upcoming Apple presentations"".
The Taiwanese Investigation Bureau, under the Ministry of Justice, told Nikkei Asia: ""We are aware of an alleged cyber-attack involving Quanta and we are taking an initial step to look into and understand the nature of the incident.

The district was hit last Wednesday, before Thanksgiving Day, but schools will remain shut on Monday and Tuesday.
""Our focus today and for Monday and Tuesday is identifying and addressing student and staff device needs so that instruction can continue,"" it said in a Sunday evening update.
But local newspaper the Baltimore Sun is reporting it could take weeks to restore the school district's computer systems fully.
Classes could, however, resume within days, using alternative methods, the newspaper suggested.
Offices remain open for staff. And the district is still providing free school meals.
The school district took to social media to post updates and implore students not to log in to the compromised systems using school-issued Windows laptops.
But it has offered very few details about the nature of the ransomware, beyond calling it a ""catastrophic attack on our technology system"".

It also posted a screen grab of the computer's file library which included more than a dozen folders catalogued under the names of porn stars and porn websites.
The infamous hacker group wrote: ""Thanks God for [named IT Director]. While he was [masturbating] we downloaded several hundred gigabytes of private information about his company's customers. God bless his hairy palms, Amen!""
The blog post has been deleted in the last couple of weeks, which experts say usually implies that the extortion attempt worked and the hackers have been paid to restore data, and not publish any more details.
The company did not respond to requests for comment.
The same hacker group is also currently trying to pressure another US utility company into paying a ransom, by posting an employee's username and password for a members-only porn website.
Another ransomware group which also has a darknet website shows the use of similar tactics.
The relatively new gang has published private emails and pictures, and is calling directly for the mayor of a hacked municipality in the US to negotiate its ransom.
In another case, hackers claim to have found an email trail showing evidence of insurance fraud at a Canadian agriculture company.
Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, says the trend points to an evolution of ransomware hacking.
""This is the new norm. Hackers are now actually searching the data for information that can be weaponised. If they find anything that is incriminating or embarrassing, they'll use it to leverage a larger pay-out. These incidents are no longer simply cyber-attacks about data, they are full-out extortion attempts.""
Another example of this was seen in December 2020, when the cosmetic surgery chain The Hospital Group was held to ransom with the threat of publication of 'before and after' images of patients.
Ransomware has evolved considerably since it first appeared decades ago.
Criminals used to operate alone, or in small teams, targeting individual internet users at random by booby-trapping websites and emails.
In the last few years, they've become more sophisticated, organised and ambitious.
Criminal gangs are estimated to be making tens of millions of dollars a year, by spending time and resources targeting and attacking large companies or public bodies for huge pay-outs, sometimes totalling millions of dollars.
Brett Callow has been following ransomware tactics for years, and says he saw another shift in methods in late 2019.
""It used to be the case that the data was just encrypted to disrupt a company, but then we started seeing it downloaded by the hackers themselves.
""It meant they could charge victims even more because the threat of selling the data on to others was strong.""
This latest trend of threatening to publicly damage an organisation or individual has particularly concerned experts because it is hard to defend against.
Keeping good backups of company data helps businesses to recover from crippling ransomware attacks, but that is not enough when the hackers use extortionware tactics.
Cyber-security consultant Lisa Ventura said: ""Employees should not be storing anything that could harm a firm reputationally on company servers. Training around this should be provided by organisations to all their staff.
""It's a troubling shift in angle for the hackers because ransomware attacks are not only getting more frequent, they are also getting more sophisticated.
""By identifying factors such as reputational damage, it offers far more leverage to extort money from victims.""
A lack of victim reporting and a culture of cover-up makes estimating the overall financial cost of ransomware difficult.
Experts at Emsisoft estimate that ransomware incidents in 2020 cost as much as $170bn (Â£123bn) in ransom payments, downtime and disruption.",Yes
623,12,ransomware,Garmin begins recovery from ransomware attack,27 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53553576,"The American GPS and fitness-tracker company Garmin is dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack, the BBC has confirmed.
Owners of its products had been unable to use its services since Thursday.
However, some of its online tools are now being provided in a ""limited"" state, according to its online dashboard.
Garmin has said it was ""the victim of a cyber-attack that encrypted some of our systems"".
But the statement it released avoided any reference to a ransom demand.
""Many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer-facing applications, and company communications,"" it said.
""We have no indication that any customer data, including payment information from Garmin Pay, was accessed, lost or stolen.""
The firm added that it expected all its systems to return to normal operation within a few days, but warned that there might be a ""backlog"" of user data to process.
It is not known if the firm paid the blackmailers, but a source told the BBC it was in the ""final stage of recovery"".
The BBC's cyber reporter Joe Tidy said the malware involved was Wasted Locker - a program that scrambles the target's data, and was first detected in the wild around April. Victims are typically contacted after their computers are infected, and told they must transfer funds if they want to return the files to their original state.
Some customers have already reported that Garmin's services appear to be ""partially"" working again.
Earlier reports claimed that the company had been asked to pay $10m (Â£7.79m) to get its systems back online.
Pilots who use flyGarmin were unable to download up-to-date aviation databases, which aviation regulators such as the FAA require pilots to have, before they can fly.
Customers were also unable to log into Garmin Connect to record and analyse their health and fitness data.
There have been many high-profile attacks in recent months, but few victims have been as tight-lipped as Garmin.
Even now, despite confirmation from many different sources across different newsrooms, the company is choosing not to admit it was ransomware.
The big question is whether or not the company paid the blackmailer what is likely to be a multi-million dollar demand.
It seems the company has somehow got the decryption key it needs to start bringing services back online.
As well as customers and shareholders, the US authorities will be very keen to know what happened.
Members of Evil Corp, the criminal group that's suspected of being behind the hack, were indicted in 2019 by the US Treasury.",Yes
624,13,ransomware,"School cyber-attack affects 40,000 pupilsâ email",29 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56569873,"A ransomware attack on multiple schools has left 37,000 pupils unable to access their email.
The Harris Federation, which runs 50 primary and secondary academies in and around London, said it had temporarily disabled email while it deals with the cyber-attack.
Data on the systems has been encrypted and hidden by the attackers.
Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a warning that hackers are targeting schools.
âWe are at least the fourth multi-academy trust to have been targeted in March,â a statement on the Harris Federation website said.
âThis is a highly sophisticated attack that will have a significant impact on our academies but it will take time to uncover the exact details of what has or has not happened, and to resolve.
âAs a precaution, we have temporarily disabled our email system.â
Any devices which the Harris Federation have given to pupils have also been disabled, the statement added.
However, schools have recently returned to in-person learning as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions - meaning students can still attend classes.
Harris Federation schools break up for Easter later this week.
Its statement did not detail what information or data has been compromised, and it has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.
The trust is working with âa specialised firm of cyber-technology consultantsâ, the National Crime Agency and the NCSC to resolve the issues.
The NCSC said it has ""recently alerted the education sector to the significant threat posed by ransomware attacks"" and urged schools and colleges to follow its advice to protect themselves online.
It used to be the case that ransomware groups concentrated their efforts on large multinational companies.
Big corporate budgets and potential business interruption mean large ransom payouts.
Publicly funded schools and colleges are therefore an odd and particularly cruel target.
One hacker group recently posted part of their negotiation conversation with another unnamed institution on the dark net.
It made for grim reading, and once again showed me how ruthless they are.
At one stage, when the hackers demanded $15m, the school wrote: ""Sir, please, this is NOT a business with profits. We operate much like a charity operates. This is a state-funded school, our salaries are paid for by taxing the people that live in the state. We have no idea how you think we can afford this.""

625,14,ransomware,Blackbaud Hack: Universities lose data to ransomware attack,23 July 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53516413,"At least 10 universities in the UK, US and Canada have had data stolen about students and/or alumni after hackers attacked a cloud computing provider.
Human Rights Watch and the children's mental health charity, Young Minds, have also confirmed they were affected.
The hack targeted Blackbaud, one of the world's largest providers of education administration, fundraising, and financial management software.
The US-based company's systems were hacked in May.
It has been criticised for not disclosing this externally until July and for having paid the hackers an undisclosed ransom.
In some cases, the data was limited to that of former students, who had been asked to financially support the establishments they had graduated from. But in others it extended to staff, existing students and other supporters.
The institutions the BBC has confirmed have been affected are:
All the institutions are sending letters and emails apologising to those on the compromised databases.
In some cases, the stolen data included phone numbers, donation history and events attended. Credit card and other payment details do not appear to have been exposed.
Blackbaud, whose headquarters are based in South Carolina, declined to provide a complete lists of those impacted, saying it wanted to ""respect the privacy of our customers"".
""The majority of our customers were not part of this incident,"" the company claimed.
It referred the BBC to a statement on its website: ""In May of 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. Prior to our locking the cyber-criminal out, the cyber-criminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment.""
The statement goes on to say Blackbaud paid the ransom demand. Doing so is not illegal, but goes against the advice of numerous law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, NCA and Europol.
Blackbaud added that it had been given ""confirmation that the copy [of data] they removed had been destroyed"".
Several Blackbaud clients listed on its site have confirmed they were not affected, including:
""My main concern is how reassuring - impossibly so, in my opinion - Blackbaud were to the university about what the hackers have obtained,"" commented Rhys Morgan, a cyber-security specialist and former student at Oxford Brookes University, whose data was involved.
""They told my university that there is 'no reason to believe that the stolen data was or will be misused'.
""I can't feel reassured by this at all. How can they possibly know what the attackers will do with that information?""
Blackbaud has said it is working with law enforcement and third party investigators to monitor whether or not the data is being circulated or sold on the dark web, for example.
Barrister blogger Matthew Scott was also sent an email about the hack.
""I doubt that my university has many details that aren't pretty easily available, but I am more concerned about giving in to the blackmail and blithely accepting the word of the blackmailer that all the data has now been destroyed,"" he told the BBC.
Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies must report a significant breach to data authorities within 72 hours of learning of an incident - or face potential fines.
The UK's Information Commissioner's Office [ICO], as well as the Canadian data authorities, were informed about the breach last weekend - weeks after Blackbaud discovered the hack.
An ICO spokeswoman said: ""Blackbaud has reported an incident affecting multiple data controllers to the ICO. We will be making enquiries to both Blackbaud and the respective controllers, and encourage all affected controllers to evaluate whether they need to report the incident to the ICO individually.""
Leeds University said, in a statement: ""We want to reassure our alumni that, since being informed by Blackbaud of this incident, we have been working tirelessly to investigate what has happened, in order to accurately inform those affected. No action is required by our alumni community at this time, although, as ever, we recommend that everyone remains vigilant.""",Yes
626,15,ransomware,Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks?,8 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419,"Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks.
Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.
Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware.
However, the new report comes on the back of a recent significant security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system.
And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with.
So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried?
Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.
Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers.
This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system.
Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware.
""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.
Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security.
""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot.""
There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as RobbinHood, a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019.
Another example is Thunderspy, an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other.
This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep.
""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.
""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more.""
The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops).
""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC.
Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software, because they only make money if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.
Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws.
The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years.
Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.
Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.
Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds.
""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do.""
Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole, to pay attention to hardware security.
""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.
""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected.""
Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.
""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.
""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""",Yes
627,16,ransomware,Redcar cyber-attack: Government to help cover costs,8 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-56668176,"A council left without online services for weeks following a cyber-attack is to receive Â£3.68m from the government to help towards the cost of rebuilding its systems.
The attack was estimated to have cost Redcar and Cleveland Council Â£10m, with the authority having to foot the remainder of the bill itself.
It said no ransom was paid to the hackers.
Critics said the government should be covering more of the cost.
Experts from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) had to be drafted in to help restore appointment bookings, planning documents, social care advice and council housing complaints systems that had been knocked offline in February last year.
The council said the money to be provided by the government would help replenish its reserves, which had been used to restore its online systems.
It declined to say whether any services would be affected as a result of covering the remainder of the bill.
Council leader Mary Lanigan, who heads a coalition of independents and Liberal Democrats, said: ""We are pleased that the government recognised the unique circumstances under which we requested support, and awarded grant funding, rightly distinguishing the criminal ransomware attack suffered by the council from the financial rescue packages of some other local authorities where permission to borrow has been granted.
""No money was handed over to these criminals and we continue to hope that they will eventually be brought to justice.""
Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland MP Simon Clarke, a Conservative, described the settlement as ""exceptionally generous"".
Fellow Tory Jacob Young, MP for Redcar, said it would ""go some way to restoring the hit on the council's finances"".
However, former council leader Sue Jeffrey, of Labour, said residents were being ""conned into thinking they have got a good deal"" having only been awarded ""a tiny proportion of the support they were promised by the government and local Conservative MPs"".

The National Cyber Security Centre said it estimated 7,000 servers had been affected by the flaw in the UK and only half had been secured.
It said malicious software had been detected on 2,300 machines but it had helped businesses remove it.
The agency said it was ""vital"" that all affected businesses took action to secure their email servers.
The announcement reveals the scale of the problem among UK companies for the first time since the global security flaw emerged last week.
Ransomware groups have begun using the flaw to install their malicious programs, the NCSC warned - though there was no evidence of widespread ransomware attacks on UK companies so far.
Once installed, ransomware locks away a user's data behind strong encryption, making the computer system unusable. The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data.
The security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system, which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide.
The NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue.
Initially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data.
But after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw.
The result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack.
""We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,"" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned.
""While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates.""
He also urged all organisations to ""familiarise"" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised.
The true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone.
What is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact.
While many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low.
That may change in the coming days as more reports come in.
What is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come.",Yes

Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council's website and all computers at the authority were attacked last Saturday, affecting 135,000 residents.
One expert said it looked like a ransomware attack, where files are scrambled until a ransom is paid.

The watchdog said the authority had ""made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information"".
The National Crime Agency said it was supporting the council, which has refused to confirm the nature of the hack.
Online appointment bookings, planning documents, social care advice and council housing complaints systems are just some of the services currently offline.

""There may be a slight delay in dealing with non-urgent calls and messages as the council's website is currently down.
""Our teams are working hard to resolve the problem and we would like to thank residents for their continued patience at this time.""
Security researcher Kevin Beaumont said: ""It seems almost certain they have suffered a severe ransomware incident.

Systems at Redcar and Cleveland Council have been down for almost three weeks after the ransomware attack.
It said it had been prioritising frontline services and has now built a new server and website, as well as mobilising a temporary call centre.
However, there may be a short delay in letting children know which secondary school they have got places at.
Since the attack on 8 February, the council has been working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the National Crime Agency.
BBC cyber security reporter
It has taken 19 days for the council to admit they are dealing with a ransomware attack.
This particularly nasty form of hack is unique and a growing problem for large targets like public authorities and companies.
Informing the public their council is being held to ransom is a key piece of information that many think people have a right to know.
It makes the situation far more serious as hackers are in control of computer systems and possibly sensitive data.
The only options are to pay the cyber criminals or rebuild from scratch by using offline backups, which is often far more costly.
With private firms the decision over whether or not to pay is often taken at board level behind closed doors but Redcar and Cleveland is a tax-payer funded body and residents may begin to demand transparency about how their money is being used.
Councillor Mary Lanigan, leader of the council, said: ""Significant progress has been made.
""All frontline services have continued, payments continue to be processed as normal, and there is no evidence so far to suggest any personal information has been removed from our servers.
""However, it may be some time before our IT capabilities are fully restored which may mean frustration for the public in dealing with us administratively.""
The delay in informing parents and carers of secondary school places would not affect the actual allocation, and it was anticipated primary admissions would be made on time, she said.
""As a council, we have always taken cyber security seriously, and we will continue to engage with the relevant authorities to ensure our systems are as secure as possible in the future,"" she said

Ransomware interrupted cameras, door-access control systems and critical monitoring systems at the site.
The agency did not reveal the name or the location of the facility targeted by the attack.
Officials said they believed the ransomware was sent in a malicious email link, clicked by an employee.
The US Coast Guard (USCG) issued a security bulletin on 16 December, urging other bases to take measures to prevent further attacks.
""Once the embedded malicious link in the email was clicked by an employee, the ransomware allowed for a threat actor to access significant enterprise information technology (IT) network files, and encrypt them, preventing the facility's access to critical files,"" it said.
""The virus further burrowed into the industrial control systems that monitor and control cargo transfer and encrypted files critical to process operations.""
The BBC has contacted the USCG for more details.
Ransomware attacks were a significant problem during 2019, when several companies and governments were targeted.
The city of New Orleans declared a state of emergency in December after suspicious activity was detected on its network.
Once officials confirmed they were under attack, servers and computers were closed down.

However, it did not name the facility or say when the attack happened.
A malicious link sent to staff at the facility eventually caused the shutdown ""of the entire pipeline asset"".
It was so severe in part because the organisation was not prepared for such an attack, the DHS statement said.
The incident was detailed in a security alert., which revealed it to be a ""spear-phishing"" attack, in which individuals are sent fraudulent but believable scam messages.
That let the attacker into the company's IT network.
Often, the ""operational network"" which runs computers in the factory is separated from the office IT - but not in this case, meaning the ransomware infection was allowed to spread.
Ransomware typically encrypts files on a victim's computer and demands payment before offering to unlock them again - although there is no guarantee that the cyber-criminals who develop such software will be true to their word.
A spate of ransomware attacks has troubled various US organisations recently - from local authorities to hospitals to a maritime base.
In the case of the natural gas facility, only one office was targeted, but others in different geographic locations were forced to close down, too.
The DHS said the affected organisation had not properly prepared for a cyber-attack of this kind - with its emergency plans being focused on all sorts of physical attacks instead.
""Consequently, emergency response exercises also failed to provide employees with decision-making experience in dealing with cyber-attacks,"" the department added.
All organisations, regardless of what sector they are in, should prepare for the possibility of a ransomware attack, said Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at cloud email firm Mimecast.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had more than 4,000 of its digital files stolen by hackers on Christmas Eve.
The files were released on the internet when Sepa refused to pay a ransom.
The public body has warned it could be next year before its systems have fully recovered from the attack.
Figures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws show a total of Â£790,000 has been spent on Sepa's response and recovery actions so far.
This includes Â£458,000 on stabilising the watchdog's business IT platform.
Sepa has restored the majority of its key services, such as flooding forecasting, but it is expected a full recovery from the attack will take up the remainder of 2021-22.
Terry A'Hearn, Sepa's chief executive, said: ""Whilst we initially lost access to our data and systems, what we didn't lose was the expertise of our 1,200 staff.
""Since Christmas Eve, teams across the agency have been working flat-out to support our people, partners and customers and to restore our systems services as quickly as possible.
""Our clear recovery strategy is gradually seeing systems being restored. By Easter, over 70% of staff will be back online and we're engaging data recovery specialists and are confident that we will recover the most important data.""
Sepa rejected a ransom demand for the attack, which was claimed by the international Conti ransomware group.
Contracts, strategy documents and databases were among the 4,000 files released.
The data has been put on the dark web - a part of the internet associated with criminality and only accessible through specialised software.
Some of the information stolen was already publicly available but other files, including data about staff and suppliers, was not.
Sepa told BBC Scotland a total of 54 people had been in touch to ask if their data was among the files stolen. This includes 27 current and former staff members.
Police Scotland is investigating the crime and has previously indicated the likely involvement of international serious and organised crime.
Det Insp Michael McCullagh said: ""Police Scotland is continuing to work closely with Sepa to investigate and provide support in response to this incident.

634,23,ransomware,Bedfordshire: Cyber-attack destroys school pupils' coursework,26 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-56544529,"Pupils' coursework has been destroyed in a ""significant"" cyber-attack on a school.
Redborne Upper School and Community College in Bedfordshire said the attack took place on Wednesday.
Although no data was taken, the school's servers were left unreadable resulting in ""the loss of a significant amount of data"", it added.
The school said it was working ""to ensure that no students will be disadvantaged"".
In a letter sent to parents on Friday, the school, based in Flitwick Road, Ampthill, said it had rebuilt its servers.
It said: ""This process has resulted in the loss of a significant amount of data including student user areas.""
The school said no data had left its servers ""and no unauthorised persons have access to any information"".
Students' personal data including academic records was kept on a different server, said the school.
The letter said: ""It is this data that will form the basis of the grades we will be supplying to exam boards this summer in most cases.""
However, it added coursework, which would play ""a significant role"" in some subjects, had been lost.
""To mitigate this we have already contacted the exam boards and are in the process of putting in place arrangements to ensure that no students will be disadvantaged by the impact of this,"" the letter said.
The school added it still has ""sufficient data"" to ""award accurate grades this summer"".
The incident comes days after the University of Northampton reported it had been hit by a cyber-attack which had interrupted IT and telephone services.
The National Cyber Security Centre said since late February an increased number of ransomware attacks had affected education establishments.
Speaking on the Today programme on Friday, its chief executive Lindy Cameron said the coronavirus pandemic has ""highlighted both the scale of our dependence on the digital world and the challenges we face"".
But she added the UK is ""one of the safest places to live and work online"".

635,24,ransomware,Ransomware hits Johannesburg electricity supply,26 July 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49125853,"A major electricity supplier in South Africa's largest city has suffered a ransomware attack, leaving some residents without power.
City Power revealed on Thursday that its IT systems had been shut down.
""It has encrypted all our databases, applications and network,"" the company tweeted, referring to the virus.
City Power's website remains offline and residents have reported problems via social media with their electricity supplies.
The ransomware attack initially affected customers' ability to buy pre-paid electricity and also hampered the firm's efforts to respond to localised blackouts.
A spokesman for City Power told the BBC that more than a quarter of a million people might have been affected.
""These are the people on pre-paid system[s] and would at any given day buy electricity,"" he said.
""Those people were not able to access the system.""
Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computers and encrypts or locks files and systems.
Attackers say they will restore access once a payment is made - but there is no guarantee that they will do so.
The City of Johannesburg, which owns the electricity company, said that most IT systems had now been restored.
However, city officials acknowledged that there were still problems and said customers could log faults on an alternative website.
""Customers should not panic as none of their details were compromised,"" read a tweet posted by the city's official Twitter account.
""We apologise for the inconvenience caused to the people of the City of Joburg.""",Yes
636,25,ransomware,US hospitals turn away patients as ransomware strikes,2 October 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49905226,"Three US hospitals have been forced to temporarily close their doors to ""all but the most critical new patients"" following a ransomware outbreak.
""A criminal is limiting our ability to use our computer systems in exchange for an as-yet unknown payment,"" said DCH Health System.
DCH operates the three affected hospitals in Alabama.
One cyber-security expert said the groups using ransomware were becoming increasingly well organised.
Computers at the DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa, Fayette Medical Center and Northport Medical Center were infected with ransomware.
The incident was first reported on 1 October.
""We will continue to divert any new admissions, other than those that are critical, to other facilities,"" DCH said in its statement.
Local ambulances have been asked to take patients to other local hospitals instead, where possible.
Outpatients with appointments at any of the three hospitals were advised to call before attending them.
However, elective procedures and surgery already scheduled for 2 October were planned to go ahead.
It is not yet known what group or individual launched the ransomware.
Separately, seven hospitals in Australia have also reported disruptive ransomware infections.
""Some elective surgery and appointments have been cancelled,"" said Barwon Health, one hospital operator affected by the incident.
The Government of Victoria said the seven hospitals were located in Gippsland and south-west Victoria.
Multiple computer systems have had to be disconnected as a result, which has meant some patient record, booking and management services have been shut down.
This could affect efforts to contact patients and schedule appointments, the Government of Victoria said: ""Where practical, hospitals are reverting to manual systems to maintain their services.""
In cases where patient histories, charts, images and other information has been made unavailable, it may be necessary to reschedule some appointments, the authority added.
Daniel Andrews, Premier of Victoria, told local media it could take ""weeks"" before the problems were fixed.
The Victorian Government Cyber Incident Response Service has dealt with more than 600 cyber-attacks since July 2018.
""Unfortunately the groups breaking into individual computers at organisations are becoming rapidly better at obtaining access across networks, and then causing chaos with a goal to being paid,"" said UK-based cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont.
""This problem isn't going to go away,"" he added.
He said organisations needed to review their security procedures and ensure that backups were in place - and also that such backups had been recently tested - so that data and systems could be restored in the event of a ransomware infection.",Yes
637,26,ransomware,Texas government organisations hit by ransomware attack,19 August 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49393479,"Hackers have infected 23 organisations connected to local government in the US state of Texas with ransomware.
Officials indicated the attack over the weekend was co-ordinated.
The Texas Department of Information said the attack had primarily affected smaller local government departments.
A spokesman said the situation was still ongoing on Monday morning.
Texan authorities have drafted in cyber-security experts, as well as the military and counter-terrorism units, to help bring systems back online.
In a statement, the Texas Department of Information Resources said evidence suggested the attacks ""came from one single threat actor"".
Officials did not release specific details of the affected departments or say whether the cyber-criminals had specified a ransom amount.
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that cyber-criminals use to disable a computer and its data until a ransom is paid.
Hackers have targeted a number of US states this year, paralysing government computers in New York, Maryland and Florida.
In May, hackers seized control of thousands of government computers in Baltimore.
The attack disabled email accounts and prevented online payments to city departments for weeks.
Officials in Baltimore refused to pay the ransom, opting instead to manually process thousands of transactions, including home sales.
They also slowly restored access to around 10,000 employee email accounts.
The city estimated losses of around $18m (Â£15m) from the attack.
The hackers originally demanded $100,000 worth of Bitcoin.
Other cities have chosen to pay.
In June, council leaders in Riviera Beach, Florida, voted to pay almost $600,000 in the digital currency Bitcoin to hackers who paralysed the city's computer systems for weeks.
A week later, officials in Lake City, Florida paid hackers $500,000 following a similar ransomware demand.
Lisa Forte, a partner at Red Goat Cyber Security, which specialises in cyber-security testing, said ransom payments left cities vulnerable to more attacks.
She said: ""Even if you do recover your data, your organisation will likely be added to a list on the dark web of 'organisations that pay ransoms'. This may lead to you being targeted again.""
Ransomware attacks are on the increase.
Liron Barak, chief executive of cyber-security firm BitDam, said the complex structure of government departments often made them an easy target for hackers.
She said: ""In addition, local governments tend to communicate with a wide variety of businesses and individuals, with many of them being one-time contacts.
""This makes them more vulnerable to attacks, as their employees don't know most of the contacts with whom they communicate, in person.""",Yes
638,27,ransomware,Google thwarts Baltimore ransomware fightback,24 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48380662,"Google has inadvertently thwarted attempts by Baltimore's city government to fight off crippling ransomware.
The cyber-attack struck civil computers in Baltimore on 7 May, blocking email accounts and online payment systems.
City officials set up GMail accounts to restore communications between citizens and staff.
The mass creation of the accounts triggered Google's GMail defences which shut them down, believing they were being used by spammers.
Google said it restored access to the GMail accounts once it discovered who had created them and why.
""Our automated security systems disabled the accounts due to the bulk creation of multiple consumer Gmail accounts from the same network,"" Google told the BoingBoing website.
The cyber-attack has meant that many day-to-day administration tasks of Baltimore's city government have stopped. It has delayed the sales of many homes, and stopped water bills being generated. And people cannot pay tax bills or parking fines.
A manual workaround for the home sales has been put in place, and the switch from internal email to GMail was another scheme to defeat the attackers.
The cyber-criminals who launched the ransomware attack have demanded a payment of $100,000 (Â£79,000) in Bitcoins to restore control of official systems to city workers. About 10,000 computers were hit by the virus.
Baltimore has so far refused to pay the ransom. The FBI and Secret Service are known to be investigating.
City Mayor Bernard Young said it was unclear when systems would be back in full operation.
Last year Baltimore was hit by a cyber-attack which knocked out the communications systems for emergency services for a day.",Yes
639,28,ransomware,Exchange email hack: Hundreds of UK firms compromised,11 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56365372,"Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers.
Cyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack.
It comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems.
But some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses.
Meanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly.
The hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium.
Microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies.
The attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world.
Microsoft released software updates for the so called ""zero-day"" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves.
However, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected.
According to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries.
Cyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves.
""As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,"" Jake Moore at Eset said.
""The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers.""
A webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network.
Once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks.
Globally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK.
Cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems.
CyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour.
The companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail.
Sean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: ""It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems.
""It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind.
""There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.""",Yes
640,29,ransomware,University of Northampton hit by cyber-attack,23 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-56500434,"A university said it continued to be ""severely impacted"" nearly a week after being hit by a cyber-attack.
The University of Northampton said the attack on 17 March interrupted services to its IT and telephone systems and servers.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has been told ""as a precaution"" and police are investigating.
A spokesman for the university said it was working to ""resolve this issue as quickly as possible"".
He said the university had involved ""IT forensics investigators"" who were advising on how to restore services and the possible cause.
""The full facts of the situation have not yet been established,"" he added.
Third-year journalism student, Lucy Holmes, 20, who has her final-year project to hand in shortly, said the loss of the university intranet was ""very annoying"".
Ms Holmes said it meant she could not access any of her course material, tutor feedback or the online library, ""which is really hard when I am trying to complete my dissertation"".
Fellow student, Richard Smyth, 19, from Northern Ireland, was having all his lectures online with one day a week of face-to-face learning.
The first year student said the cyber attack has meant that all assignment deadlines have had to be pushed back.
He added that students still had access to UK Wifi networks.
""There has been some alternative ways to get round this [cyber attack] with teachers trying their best to keep things going using alternative video-conferencing platforms,"" he said.
Universities and colleges were warned by the UK's cyber-security agency about a rise in cyber-attacks.
The National Cyber Security Centre said that since late February, an increased number of ransomware attacks had affected education establishments.
Earlier this month Queen's University in Belfast had to suspend access to several of its systems as a precaution following an attempted cyber-attack.
The University of Northampton said those who carried out the attack had ""no regard to the disruption to teaching and learning such attacks cause"".
Northamptonshire Police said it was working with the National Cyber Security Centre to ""support the university and investigate this cyber-attack"".
A spokeswoman for the force said inquiries were ""ongoing"".

641,30,ransomware,The quiet scheme saving thousands from ransomware,26 July 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49096991,"A free scheme to prevent cyber-attack victims paying ransom to hackers claims to have saved more than 200,000 victims at least $108m (Â£86m).
The No More Ransom project offers advice and software to recover computer files encrypted in ransomware attacks.
Founded by Europol, police in the Netherlands, and McAfee, it now has more than 150 global partners.
With 14 new tools introduced in 2019 alone, Europol says it can now decrypt 109 different types of infection.
""When we take a close look at ransomware, we see how easy a device can be infected in a matter of seconds,"" says Steven Wilson, head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3).
""A wrong click and databases, pictures and a life of memories can disappear forever.
""No More Ransom brings hope to the victims, a real window of opportunity, but also delivers a clear message to the criminals: the international community stands together with a common goal, operational successes are and will continue to bring the offenders to justice.""
Among the ransomware campaigns tackled by the project is GandCrab - one of the most aggressive in 2018.
Since the release of the first GandCrab tool in February 2018, nearly 40,000 people have successfully decrypted their files, saving roughly $50m in ransom payments.
In 2019, there has been a surge in ransomware attacks particularly aimed at large companies.
One company, Norsk Hydro, has already spent well over Â£50m recovering from an attack in March that halted production lines and locked staff out of their computers.
In the US, multiple local government authorities have been hit with ransomware attacks, some choosing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to hackers.
After South Korea, most web traffic to No More Ransom comes from the US.
However, the US is not a partner in the project. The full partners consist of 36 law enforcement agencies from Europe, Asia and South America.
The US should be doing more to help victims and tackle cyber-criminals, says Fabian Wosar, head of cyber-security company Emsisoft, which has donated more decryption tools to the project than anyone else.
Mr Wosar told BBC News: ""Projects like No More Ransom have been crucial when it comes to fighting ransomware on a global level, with pretty much all major parties cooperating on a global and daily basis, sharing intel[igence] in real-time - except for the US.
""The US should consider the success of the No More Ransom Project to be a call to action.
""Better cooperation between the private sector and law enforcement could result in fewer ransom demands being paid.
""That would make cyber-crime less profitable and, consequently, reduce the financial incentive for groups to commit cyber-crime.""",Yes
642,31,ransomware,Baltimore ransomware attack: NSA faces questions,27 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48423954,"Politicians representing a US city struck by a ransomware attack are asking questions of the National Security Agency after claims it helped make the breach possible.
The New York Times reported on Saturday that a hacking vulnerability known as EternalBlue has been exploited to blackmail Baltimore's local government.
The NSA discovered the flaw, but the paper claims that its cyber-spies kept the discovery secret for years.
The NSA declined to comment.
But the report has particular resonance as the organisation is headquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland, which is a short drive from Baltimore.
""We don't have anything for you on this,"" an NSA spokesman told the BBC.
The EternalBlue flaw has been implicated in a range of cyber-attacks over the past three years, including the WannaCry assault that disrupted the UK's NHS.
It involves a bug in old versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system that allows other malicious code to be run on infected computers.
The NSA reportedly created a tool to do this, which it also called EternalBlue.
The New York Times said the agency did not disclose the problem to Microsoft for more than five years until a breach forced its hand.
Microsoft released a fix for EternalBlue flaw in March 2017.
Weeks later, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers leaked the NSA's related hacking tool online.
The NSA has never confirmed how it came to lose control of its code nor officially commented on the affair.
But the suggestion is that if it had shared its findings with Microsoft at an earlier stage, fewer PCs would have been exposed to subsequent attacks that made use of the vulnerability.
Thousands of Baltimore's city government computers were frozen on 7 May after their files became digitally scrambled.
The criminals responsible demanded 13 Bitcoin ($114,440; Â£90,200) to unlock them all, or three Bitcoin to release specific systems ahead of a deadline, which has now passed.
The authorities refused.
Local residents have been unable to pay utility bills, parking tickets and some taxes online as a consequence.
In addition, staff have been unable to send or receive emails from their normal accounts.
Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger have told the Baltimore Sun newspaper that they are now seeking ""a full briefing"" directly from the NSA.
""We must ensure that the tools developed by our agencies do not make their way into the hands of bad actors,"" the senator told the paper.
Some security experts say if EternalBlue is truly involved, then IT managers should have installed a patch long ago.
But one consultant noted that this may have been easier said than done.
""For some organisations, patching can be a non-trivial exercise, even with a couple of years of lead time,"" said Troy Hunt.
""Specialised systems such as medical devices, for example, often go unpatched for long periods of time.
""Offsetting that risk are factors such as the devices not being internet-connected. although given we're still seeing infections due to EternalBlue two years after it was patched, evidently there are still systems out there both unpatched and exposed.""
It's not exactly the talk of the town here - after all, it's not like Facebook has gone down, merely crucial public services.
For those who have been affected, it's very frustrating - a delayed house sale here, a new business that can't open on schedule there. One person told me about how they have been unable to pay for their wedding venue at a place part-owned by the city.
Another told me they couldn't go online to pay a parking ticket - that's not as fortunate as it sounds, trust me.
A further kick in the teeth for this city is the suggestion that this attack used an exploit discovered not by the Russians or Chinese, but by an organisation based just 20 miles away - the US National Security Agency.
City officials want answers on that, but locals don't want it to be a scapegoat. There have been repeated warnings here about severe underinvestment in government IT infrastructure.",Yes
643,32,ransomware,Baltimore government held hostage by hackers' ransomware,23 May 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-48371476,"The US city of Baltimore's government, long plagued by dysfunction, is now battling a ransomware attack that has crippled its systems for more than two weeks and counting.
Hackers breached the Maryland city's servers on 7 May and demanded $100,000 (Â£79,000) worth of Bitcoin.
The ransomware has blocked government email accounts and disabled online payments to city departments.
Baltimore city officials have so far refused to pay the ransom.
It is the second cyber-attack to strike the city in as many years - the last one knocked out its emergency dispatch system for about a day.
The FBI and Secret Service are investigating the latest breach.
Baltimore Mayor Bernard ""Jack"" Young has acknowledged it is unclear when the systems will be back in operation this time.
""I know the folks in the technology office are working diligently to bring us back on board,"" said his spokesman, Lester Davis.
Aviel Rubin, a cybersecurity expert and computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, estimates ""conservatively"" that it will be months before the systems are up and running.
""It's clear the system was vulnerable,"" he adds.
More than 1,500 homes sales have been delayed because the hackers left the city unable to notify insurers whether the sellers had any unpaid liens.
Baltimore this week rolled out a ""manual workaround"" to allow real estate transactions to proceed during the outage.
But citizens are unable to access online sites to pay their water bills, property taxes and parking tickets.
And 10,000 city government computers are locked, leaving employees with no email.
The city said there would be no late fees or fines during the technological shutdown.
In the ransom note, obtained by the Baltimore Sun, hackers demanded payment of three bitcoins - currently worth around $23,600 - per system, or 13 bitcoins for the release of the entire government network.
If the city failed to pay within four days, the note said, the price would increase.
After 10 days - a deadline that lapsed last week - the city would not be able to get the data back.
""We've watched you for days and we've worked on your systems to gain full access to your company and bypass all of your protections,"" the hackers wrote.
""We won't talk more, all we know is MONEY!""
The program, called RobbinHood, makes it impossible to access the servers without a specific digital key.
Prof Rubin said that the ransomware uses a publicly available algorithm called RSA to encrypt the data.
""It is believed that no government has the capability to break it,"" Prof Rubin said.
Without the key - held by the hackers - it's as if Baltimore's government ""just lost everything"", he said.
Baltimore has contracted computer experts to help.
Atlanta, Georgia, was hit with a similar breach in March 2018. That one was attributed to two Iranians.
Local media reported the hack cost the city $17m to recover.
Fortunately for Atlanta, the city had cyber-insurance, which helped the city foot the bill for its digital recovery. Baltimore had no such policy in place before this month's attack.
""This is impacting cities throughout the country,"" the Baltimore mayor's spokesman said.
""It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.""
The Baltimore breach reflects a wider increase in ransomware attacks, Prof Rubin said, to which many government agencies have been slow to respond.
Yes. Fallout from a sprawling corruption scandal in the city's police department has been playing out since 2017 after eight police officers were found guilty of robbing citizens and stealing overtime pay.
Earlier this month Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh resigned amid uproar over lucrative business deals for her self-published children's books.
Mr Young enjoyed no political honeymoon when he stepped in to replace Ms Pugh on 9 May - two days after the cyber-attack.",Yes
644,33,ransomware,Second US town pays up to ransomware hackers,26 June 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48770128,"A town in Florida has paid $500,000 (Â£394,000) to hackers after a ransomware attack.
The total paid by Florida municipalities over ransomware in the last two weeks now stands at $1.1m.
Officials in Lake City voted to pay hackers in Bitcoin after suffering downed computer systems for two weeks.
Coastal suburb Riviera Beach recently paid hackers $600,000 following a similar incident that locked municipal staff out of important files.
According to reports, IT staff in Lake City disconnected staff computers within minutes of the attack starting, but it was too late.
Workers were locked out of email accounts and members of the public were left unable to make municipal payments online.
The town's insurer was contacted by the hackers and negotiated ransom payment of 42 bitcoins, or roughly $500,000. Officials felt that paying the ransom was the most efficient way of regaining computer access.
""I would have never dreamed this could have happened, especially in a small town like this,"" mayor Stephen Witt told local media.
Insurance would cover the vast majority of the ransom payment, he added, although $10,000 would be incurred by taxpayers.
Just last week, it was reported that another Florida municipality had paid $600,000 in Bitcoin to hackers following a similar ransomware attack.
The computer infection in Riviera Beach, a suburb of Palm Beach, affected email as well as emergency response systems and forced staff to switch to using paper for some tasks.
Ransomware attacks have become an increasingly common tool for cyber-criminals. Municipal staff in one Alaskan community reverted to using typewriters after their computers were hit by ransomware last year.
Attacks have also affected the US cities of Baltimore and Atlanta as well as towns in California, North Carolina and Ohio, among other places.
In 2016, three US hospitals were hit by ransomware infections.
""Ransomware is the canary in the coal mine,"" said cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont, who argued that the spate of attacks showed organisations needed to get better at basic IT security.
""Organisations are financing their attackers to be better than them - and sooner or later that situation may snowball for everybody else trying to defend their networks.""
He advised having robust back-ups and disaster recovery protocols to avoid being crippled by ransomware, should it strike.
Cyber-security experts have consistently advised not paying ransoms as there is no guarantee files or computer systems will be restored.
But recovering from a ransomware infection without paying up is also expensive.
The large aluminium manufacturer Norsk Hydro recently became a victim of ransomware and decided not to pay the hackers.
Nonetheless, the cost of recovering from the attack has so far totalled Â£45m.",Yes
645,34,ransomware,How a ransomware attack cost one firm Â£45m,25 June 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48661152,"When malicious hackers disable your business and demand a ransom, should you pay up? Many firms do out of desperation, turning to intermediaries to help broker the deal. But law enforcement says this just makes things worse.
Imagine the excitement when hackers gained a foothold in the computer system of Norsk Hydro, a global aluminium producer.
We don't know when it was, but it's likely that once inside they spent weeks exploring this group's IT systems, probing for more weaknesses.
When they eventually launched their ransomware attack, it was devastating - 22,000 computers were hit across 170 different sites in 40 different countries.
Chief information officer Jo De Vliegher reopens the ransom note that appeared on computers all over the company. It read: ""Your files have been encrypted with the strongest military algorithms... without our special decoder it is impossible to restore the data.""
The entire workforce - 35,000 people - had to resort to pen and paper.
Production lines shaping molten metal were switched to manual functions, in some cases long-retired workers came back in to help colleagues run things ""the old fashioned way"".
In many cases though, production lines simply had to stop.
Imagine the hacker's anticipation as they waited to receive a reply to their ransom note. After all, every minute counts for a modern manufacturing powerhouse. They probably thought they could name their price.
But the reply never came. The hackers were never even asked how much money they wanted. Imagine the shock.
All that work. For nothing.
It's been more than three months since Norsk Hydro was attacked and they are still many months away from making a full recovery. It's so far cost them more than Â£45m.
But what they've lost in productivity and revenue, they've arguably gained in reputation.
The company's response is being described as ""the gold standard"" by law enforcement organisations and the information security industry. Not only did they refuse to pay the hackers but they've also been completely open and transparent with the outside world about what happened to them.
But there are many other companies and organisations who make the opposite choice, and evidence is growing that ransomware hackers are increasingly being paid off secretly by victims - and their insurance companies - looking for the easy way out.
""It's become a simple business case for many organisations to pay, and at this point it's a known secret that this is happening,"" says Josh Zelonis, cyber-security analyst at Forrester.
Secrecy surrounds the practice because organisations are concerned about the possibility of litigation and the damage to their reputations following an attack, says Mr Zelonis.
""And a lot of the time incident response companies are being brought in to broker the transaction with the adversaries themselves in order to ensure that the payment is made and recovery is possible,"" he says.
Sources in the information security industry have described multiple occasions when large, well-known companies have paid out thousands of pounds - in some cases hundreds of thousands - to hackers and not told the public or even shareholders.
More Technology of Business
Just last week, a Florida town paid hackers $600,000 (Â£475,000) to get its computers working again after a ransomware attack disabled email, hit emergency response systems and forced staff to use paper-based admin systems.
It's a troubling trend that's prompted Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, to re-issue its warning that paying ransoms fuels hackers and often leads to more organised crime.
One US-based company, Coveware, specialises in negotiating ransoms between hackers and their victims. Visiting its offices in Connecticut, it's clear it operates at the sharp end of cyber-crime.
There is no permanent office, instead people move around shared workspaces. The entire team is dispersed around the world.
Chief executive and founder Bill Siegel admits that the service is an ""unpalatable"" one, but insists that it is needed. He wouldn't give details on the companies that he's helped but says: ""At any one time we have half a dozen to a dozen cases, some of the companies are big, including public companies and name brands.""
The company's own research indicates that the hackers' demands, usually an exchange of untraceable Bitcoin, are increasing.
""Ideally we wouldn't pay or we'd negotiate down a lot,"" says Mr Siegel, ""but we recognise that when a company needs to pay - and it's a large number - then that's what needs to happen, and that can be seven figures.
""Everybody recognises that this is not a good outcome but you're dealing with the life or death of a company.""
The most infamous ransomware virus was called WannaCry and infected 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries, including causing notable disruption to the National Health Service in the UK.
Since then ransomware attack numbers have actually declined significantly.
Cyber Security vendor Trend Micro estimates that numbers could have dropped 91% in the past year. But data from many other vendors points to a rise in more targeted attacks, where companies and organisations, instead of individuals, are in the cross-hairs.
Researchers at cyber-security company Malwarebytes say that compared to the same time last year, business detections of ransomware have risen more than 500%.
Back at Norsk Hydro, Mr De Vliegher said he tries not to think of the hackers and takes no satisfaction in knowing he foiled their plans.
""I think in general it's a very bad idea to pay,"" he says. ""It fuels an industry and it's probably financing other sorts of crime. It goes against our company values and we have good foundations and good people.
""But I understand why, for some companies who are less secure, this can be the only option.""
His words are echoed by Europol's head of the European Cybercrime Centre, Steven Wilson.
""Companies need to understand that if you continue to pay a ransom it perpetuates the crime,"" he says. ""It encourages the criminals to commit further crimes.
""If you pay, you're fuelling organised crime on a global basis.""",Yes
646,35,ransomware,Huge aluminium plants hit by 'severe' ransomware attack,19 March 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47624207,"One of the world's biggest aluminium producers has switched to manual operations at some smelting plants following a ""severe"" ransomware attack.
Hydro, which employs more than 35,000 people in 40 countries, says the attack began on Monday night and is ongoing.
Some of the company's factories have been forced to halt production though other facilities, including its power plants, are functioning normally.
The firm's website is down but updates are being posted to Facebook.
US factories were among those affected, as were smelting plants in Norway.
Notices have been posted at the entrances to some of Hydro's offices telling employees not to log in to their computers.
Staff worldwide are instead using mobile phones and tablets to access their emails, according to Hydro's chief financial officer Eivind Kallevik.
At some factories, workers are using printed order lists while they remain unable to retrieve order data from their computers.
Norwegian security authorities said they were investigating the possibility that the cyber-attack was caused by a relatively new form of ransomware known as LockerGoga. However, they added it was not yet clear that this was the case.
A spokesman for Hydro also told the BBC that he could not yet confirm who was behind the attack.
He added that digital systems at Hydro's main smelting plants were programmed to ensure machinery worked efficiently.
However, these systems had had to be turned off at some of the facilities.
""They are much more reliant today on computerised systems than they were some years ago,"" a spokesman said.
""But they have the option of reverting back to methods that are not as computerised, so we are able to continue production.""
Work was also stopped at some metal extrusion plants, where aluminium is processed into products such as building facades.
The firm said it was working to contain and ""neutralise"" the attack and added that it had not caused any safety-related incidents.
It added that it had data backups ready with which to restore systems once the virus had been dealt with.
Norway's state cyber-security agency is helping Hydro to respond to the incident.
Cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont told the BBC that if the LockerGoga ransomware had been used, it would likely have been deployed to Hydro's systems manually by an attacker.
This could have been done by someone who had gained administrator access to those systems.
""For an industrial manufacturing business this is potentially bad news, as it may have spread across their company, including near industrial control systems,"" added Mr Beaumont.",Yes
647,36,ransomware,Nurseries sent first official cyber-attack warning,15 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-56403778,"Nurseries and childminders are being warned of the threat of cyber-attacks, in guidance from the government's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
It is the first time that the agency - part of the GCHQ intelligence service - has given guidance to a sector caring for such young children.
It includes warnings to use password protection for information for parents.
""We know that incidents affecting the education sector are increasingly common,"" said Sarah Lyons at the NCSC.
The cyber-agency says pre-school providers and childminders are ""increasingly relying on technology to operate"" and have become an ""appealing target"" for cyber-attacks.
Cyber-criminals could be seeking personal information about children or families, and to target the payments process for parents, warns the NCSC.
The early years cyber-security advice warns about malicious software, so-called ""malware"", and the need to protect personal information and data.
""Cyber-criminals will go after anybody, provided there's money to be made,"" says the NCSC's advice.
The cyber-security agency calls for a more secure approach to sharing information, including newsletters for parents.
""You should password protect newsletters so only families who have been given the password can open them,"" says the guidance.
The NCSC says many scam emails are ""preying on fears of Covid-19"" and warns nurseries and child minders to watch out for fake messages trying to obtain information with false claims, including:
There are also warnings about protecting computer devices, including smartphones, and to guard against scam phone calls and text messages.
Education at all age groups has become a significant target for cyber-attacks.
A big multi-site further education college, the South and City College Birmingham, has been forced to close by a ""major ransomware attack"" - with the college telling students to stay home this week.
Universities faced a wave of cyber-attacks last autumn, targeting research and data and causing disruption to computer systems.
The NCSC is now widening its advice to the early years sector.
Sarah Lyons, deputy director for economy and society engagement at the NCSC, said across educational settings it was ""vital that all providers know how to secure their devices and sensitive data"".
But she said many people in early years ""work on their own, without dedicated IT support"".
""This guidance sets out the practical first steps they can take to protect themselves from cyber-incidents.""
""Like most professions, the early years sector is increasingly reliant on technology, and this new guidance will support them with protecting sensitive data,"" said Vicky Ford, children and families minister.
""It is paramount that early years settings have robust cyber-security in place to help them communicate with children, families and staff delivering early education and childcare provision safely,"" she said.",Yes

649,38,ransomware,"Cyber criminals publish more than 4,000 stolen Sepa files",21 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-55757884,"Cyber criminals who stole thousands of digital files belonging to environmental regulator Sepa have published them on the internet.
The public body had about 1.2GB of data stolen from its digital systems on Christmas Eve.
Sepa rejected a ransom demand for the attack, which has been claimed by the international Conti ransomware group.
Contracts, strategy documents and databases are among the 4,000 files released.
The data has been put on the dark web - a part of the internet associated with criminality and only accessible through specialised software.
Sepa chief executive Terry A'Hearn said: ""We've been clear that we won't use public finance to pay serious and organised criminals intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds.
""We have made our legal obligations and duty of care on the sensitive handling of data a high priority and, following Police Scotland advice, are confirming that data stolen has been illegally published online.
""We're working quickly with multi-agency partners to recover and analyse data then, as identifications are confirmed, contact and support affected organisations and individuals.""
The attack locked Sepa's emails and contacts centre but Sepa said ""priority regulatory, monitoring, flood forecasting and warning services were continuing to adapt and operate"".
Sepa said the theft was the equivalent to a fraction of the contents of an average laptop hard drive.
Some of the information stolen was already publicly available but other files included data about staff and suppliers was not.
Where information has been identified to date, staff have been contacted and are being supported.
Brett Callow, of cyber security company Emsisoft, has been tracking the Sepa ransomware attack.
He said: ""Conti may well be the work of the same people behind another type of ransomware called Ryuk.
""There are similarities in the code, ransom note and attack mechanisms.
""When the complete haul of data is posted like this, it usually means the group has given up hope of being able to extract payment from the victim of monetise the data in other ways.
""It's a loss for them. At this point, they've lost all leverage and the action is intended to serve as a warning to future victims.""
Det Insp Michael McCullagh, of Police Scotland's cybercrime investigations unit, said: ""This remains an ongoing investigation.
""Inquiries remain at an early stage and continue to progress including deployment of specialist cybercrime resources to support this response.""
The authorities will be pleased.
It looks like Sepa decided not to play ball with the cyber criminals.
Ransomware is a scourge that is costing organisations billions of pounds and every time a victim pays, it fuels further attacks.
Sadly for Sepa this is far from over.
By the looks of the stash of files that the hackers stole and encrypted, Sepa will have months of work ahead to try to recover important documents and spreadsheets from backups and rebuild their records.
It's also telling that, according to the hackers website, almost 1,000 people have so far looked at the documents.
Who knows what other criminals or hackers are poring over the files right now.
Making the documents open to all means that information can be extracted to potentially be used against Sepa in further attacks or extortion attempts.
It will be months, perhaps even years until the organisation can say it is safe once more and can put this cyber attack behind it.",Yes
650,39,ransomware,Health to be on cyber-security's front line in 2021,28 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55411830,"Covid-19 catapulted the health sector to the forefront of cyber-security in 2020, but the next year is likely to see the dangers continue and evolve.
Threats from nation states and criminals to the health system are a growing concern.
The huge logistical challenge of rolling out vaccines faces the risk of disruption to complex supply chains.
And criminal ransomware poses a threat at a time when the pandemic has increased our reliance on technology.
The distribution of the various coronavirus vaccines may bring relief, but it also brings with it a major challenge: many of those involved have not had to think hard about security in the past.
The complex global supply chain for vaccines ranges from factories in one country to internet-connected fridges in another.
It will create new pressure on doctors' surgeries, IT systems, and sometimes small providers who play a critical role.
IBM has already said it has seen suspected state-hackers target the ""cold chain"" used to keep supplies at the right temperature during transportation.
And in the UK, the National Cyber Security Centre, which worked quickly when the pandemic began to secure vaccine research, has since pivoted its efforts towards vaccine distribution.
At least the large pharmaceutical companies are no stranger to cyber-espionage. Their security officials say they first began thinking hard about the issue after a major espionage campaign back in Spring 2010.
But the issues around the pandemic have changed the sector's importance.
""We are now on a grander stage,"" is how one person involved puts it.
In July, the UK accused Russian intelligence of targeting research, including for the Oxford vaccine, while the US accused Chinese hackers of similar activity.
The emergence of ""vaccine nationalism"" led intelligence and security officials to raise questions about whether countries could try and undermine the efforts of others going forward.
""It could be trying to steal the intellectual property for financial purposes,"" Tonya Ugoretz of the FBI told a recent Aspen Institute Cyber Summit.
""It could be to undermine confidence... or to advantage another country's own development.
""We see our most determined nation-state adversaries not just relying on one method to target the supply chain, but combining cyber with using more traditional espionage and human sources.""
One much discussed tactic is the deliberate spread of misinformation online about vaccinations, or questioning a country's safety and testing record.
The UK Army's 77th Brigade has supported a Cabinet Office investigation into whether foreign states are driving anti-vaccine fears within the UK.
Most sentiment was domestically generated, head of Strategic Command General Sir Patrick Sanders said at a recent Chatham House event.
And he raised the possibility of retaliation.
""Where these things are being fuelled from overseas, then we will take action, and if the NCF (National Cyber Force) has a part to play in that, it will.""
But despite concerns about states, experts say, criminal ransomware - the locking of people out of their computers and data until they pay - remains the more serious and persistent threat.
There was some talk at the start of pandemic from criminal gangs that they would not target health. But it did not last and attacks have multiplied.
A recent report from security firm Positive Technologies says half of all the cyber-attacks on healthcare were ransomware in the July-to-September quarter of 2020.
US hospitals have been worse hit than the UK. It is thought this is because criminals see them as richer than their NHS counterparts.
In just 24 hours in October, six American hospitals received ransom demands of at least $1m (Â£810,000), leading to some cancer treatments being cancelled.
""The healthcare sector has become such a big, rich, juicy target,"" Greg Garcia, executive director for the US Cybersecurity of the Health Sector Co-ordinating Council, recently said.
""It's as if they moved on from the financial services sector.""
The UK has made stride to fix weaknesses in the NHS systems exposed by 2017's Wannacry ransomware attack. Even so, there are concerns it could be hit again.
Dr Saif Abed has long warned that such an attack could kill a patient.
He is a former NHS doctor who left clinical practice to set up the AbedGraham group, which advises on IT security risks to health.
""The thing that's really concerning is that attackers now understand the concept of clinical urgency,"" he says.
""They understand: 'If we create a risk that disrupts the ability to provide patient care, we're more likely to get a payout.'""
His worry is that the pandemic has accelerated the digitisation of health.
While that has brought benefits such as consultations taking place online, he says the investment needed to keep internet-connected systems and devices secure has not kept pace.
Dr Abed says he often hears security researchers talk about hacking insulin pumps to kill someone.
But he says a bigger risk is the fact that more devices are being connected together while remaining vulnerable, leading to the risk of a cascade effect.
He adds that his biggest worry is that criminals move from just locking organisations out of their health data to starting to tamper with it, posing risks to patient safety.
The desire to limit further Covid-19 outbreaks may also create a further drive to share data more broadly.
And that in turn may present further opportunities to steal or subvert it.
Another sign that the cyber-security of health is likely to be on the front line in 2021.",Yes
651,40,ransomware,Arran Brewery hit by ransomware attack,20 September 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-45587903,"A Scottish brewery has warned other firms to stay alert after it fell victim to a ransomware attack.
Arran Brewery said it was locked out of its own computer system after being duped into opening an email attachment that contained a virus.
According to the firm, the culprits then demanded two bitcoins, worth a total of Â£9,600, to restore its system.
Arran said it declined to pay, despite losing three months' worth of sales data from one server.
The company added that it had since used an IT consultant to eliminate the virus, and it was working on restoring the lost data.
What is ransomware?
Ransomware involves computer viruses that threaten to delete your files unless you pay a ransom.
Like other viruses, it usually finds its way onto a device by exploiting a security hole in vulnerable software or by tricking somebody into installing it.
Arran Brewery managing director Gerald Michaluk described the attack as ""very devious"".
He said: ""We advertise job vacancies on our website. One such job vacancy was for a credit control and finance assistant post, now filled.
""Out of the blue we started getting applicants for the post from all over the country and the world.
""I assumed one of my colleagues had advertised the post. However, this was not the case; the attackers had taken our website vacancy and posted it on some international jobs site.
""We were getting three of four emails a day, all with attached CVs. The virus was in amongst the genuine job seekers, and when the CV was opened it took effect.""
He added: ""I hope if anyone finds themselves in a similar position they can recognise the MO of these bandits and not have the same issues we have had.""
Gerry Grant, chief ethical hacker at the Scottish Business Resilience Centre, said ransomware remained a popular ""attack vector"" for criminals.
He said: ""It can be very difficult to verify every single email that comes in but you should be suspicious about attachments from people you don't know or are not expecting.
""My advice to people is that they should not pay any ransom because there is no guarantee that those responsible won't ask you for more money even if you pay up.
""The best course of action is to contact the police and alert them to an attack.
""Firms should also make sure they have a plan in place if it happens so they don't run about in a panic.""
Ch Insp Scott Tees, of Police Scotland's cyber crime prevention team, said: ""Ransomware attacks can be very sophisticated and potentially devastating for individuals and small businesses.
""We would advise every computer user to ensure they're running the latest versions of security software, have their data backed up regularly to cloud services or devices not connected to their computer.
""Be extremely vigilant about opening any unsolicited email and visiting websites you are not familiar with.
""There is a lot of help available online including Police Scotland's website and www.getsafeonline.org.""",Yes

The Port released a statement saying the malware had infiltrated its computer network and was disrupting administration systems.
It said the attack had not stopped ships or boats using the port, or put members of the public in danger.
The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are helping the Port investigate and clean up in the wake of the outbreak.
""This is mainly an administrative issue and normal Port operations are continuing as usual,"" Randa Coniglio, chief executive of the port, said in a statement.
The main impact would be on the issuing of park permits, public records requests and general business services, it added.
The Port said some of the disruption was because of staff shutting down computers that were in danger of being compromised as the ransomware started to spread.
The organisation did not say which malware was used in the attack but added that payment was being demanded in Bitcoins by the hackers behind the outbreak.
The Port is just one of many shipping-related industries that have been hit by ransomware.
In July, the China Ocean Shipping Company's terminal in Long Beach was briefly closed by a malware attack.

The infection has knocked out some electronic communications at several of its North American locations.
In a statement, it said a ""local network breakdown"" had hit its American region. It said it had isolated the offices as it investigated.
China Ocean Shipping is China's largest carrier of containerised goods and the fourth largest of these maritime operators in the world.
Cosco's US website plus email and many phone lines were all reportedly rendered inoperable by the outbreak.
Instead of using its own communications system. the infection forced Cosco staff to use Twitter and free Yahoo email addresses to handle queries.

654,43,ransomware,NHS ransomware attack response criticised,17 April 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43795001,"The government and NHS bodies have been criticised by MPs for failing to implement measures to improve cyber-security nearly a year after a major ransomware attack on the service.
Twenty-two recommendations were made after the WannaCry attack led to nearly 20,000 cancelled hospital appointments.
The Public Accounts Committee said it was ""alarming"" these measures had still not been introduced.
The government said cyber-security in the NHS had improved since the attack.
The PAC report found the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS bodies had been ""unprepared"" for the global WannaCry attack, which happened in May and affected more than 200,000 computers in at least 100 countries.
A total of 80 of 236 NHS trusts across England suffered disruption, as well as another 603 NHS organisations, including 595 GP practices.
MPs said the attack could have been ""much worse"" and the NHS had been ""lucky"" the threat had been tackled quickly.
But they warned future attacks could be more sophisticated and malicious, ""resulting in the theft or compromise of patient data"".
In February, the DHSC, NHS England and NHS Improvement published a set of 22 ""lessons learned"" recommendations following the cyber-attack.
But months later the DHSC still did not know what the proposals would cost or when they would be implemented, the committee said.
Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: ""The extensive disruption caused by WannaCry laid bare serious vulnerabilities in the cyber-security and response plans of the NHS.
""But the impact on patients and the service more generally could have been far worse. And government must waste no time in preparing for future cyber-attacks - something it admits are now a fact of life.
""It is therefore alarming that, nearly a year on from WannaCry, plans to implement the lessons learned are still to be agreed.""
The report said cyber-attacks were ""weapons"" that needed to be treated as a ""serious, critical threat"".
It said the use of a nerve agent to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury had ""heightened concerns about the UK's ability to respond to international threats, and hammers home the risks from those hostile to the UK"".
The report said: ""A cyber-attack is a weapon which can have a huge impact on safety and security.
""It needs to be treated as a serious, critical threat.
""The rest of government could also learn important lessons from WannaCry.""
Among other recommendations, the committee called on the DHSC and NHS bodies to urgently agree on and implement cyber-security plans and provide an update on their progress to the committee in June.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Every part of the NHS must be clear that it has learned the lessons of Wannacry.
""The health service has improved its cyber-security since the attack, but there is more work to do to protect data and patient care.
""We have supported that work by investing over Â£60m to address key cyber-security weaknesses - and plan to spend a further Â£150m over the next two years to improve resilience, including setting up a new National Secure Operations Centre to boost our ability to prevent, detect and respond to incidents.""

655,44,ransomware,Ransomware tops malicious attack charts,10 April 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43713037,"Ransomware has become the most popular form of malware used in cyber-attacks, suggests a study.
Almost 40% of all successful malware-based attacks involved ransomware suggests the annual Verizon data breach investigations report.
The types of systems compromised were changing too, it found, with criminals trying to hit databases not just PCs.
It also indicated firms had significant success dealing with some types of cyber-attacks.
They had particular success in dealing with attempts to knock web servers offline and spotting phishing emails,
""Ransomware breaches doubled last year and could double again this year,"" said Gabe Bassett, senior information security scientist at Verizon who helped compile and write the report.
Once ransomware infects a machine it encrypts data until a payment, usually in the form of a popular cryptocurrency, is made.
Mr Bassett said ransomware was popular because it let cyber-thieves quickly cash in on the security mistakes made by firms both large and small.
Desktop machines were most likely to be compromised by ransomware, found the report, but attackers had started turning their attention to more critical business systems.
""We are seeing more and more databases hit as attackers find these systems online and encrypt them,"" said Mr Bassett, adding that the numbers of such attacks trebled last year.
He said these were attractive targets because companies were more likely to pay a high ransom to unlock the business-critical data.
Bill Conner, chief executive at security firm SonicWall said the high-profile WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks in 2017 were behind the growing popularity of the category. And, he added, it was now starting to hit a very ""target rich"" segment.
""Ransomware is really the first time that medium and small companies have been targeted,"" he said. ""But they are least prepared because they have the least money and they cannot go out and hire cyber-experts.""
Ransomware was just one common attack among many in the arsenal of cyber-thieves, said Mr Bassett.
Other popular attacks include:
Despite the relentless tide of attacks, the report also found that companies were enjoying success when fighting off some cyber-threats, said Mr Bassett.
Firms were now much less likely to fall victim to phishing and so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS involves swamping a server with traffic so it becomes unresponsive or crashes.
""We know how to deal with DDoS,"" said Mr Bassett. ""We have defences against them and they work."" Statistics in the report suggest server downtime caused by DDoS often only lasts a few minutes.
In addition, he said, many companies had got better at dealing with phishing by quarantining the machines of those staff who were most likely to click on a malicious link or document.
And, added Mr Bassett, while cyber-attackers put billions of malicious files on the net every year, the number that got through to firms was often quite small.
On average, found the Verizon survey, firms received about seven pieces of malware a day.
""That's a threat we can handle,"" said Mr Bassett. ""The reality is that there's a lot that we can do. We can take some simple steps and make it much harder for attackers.""",Yes
656,45,ransomware,Ransomware hits Atlanta police dashcam footage,7 June 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44397482,"Years of video evidence gathered by police has been lost thanks to a ransomware attack on Atlanta in the US.
Most of the lost evidence involves dashcam recordings, said Atlanta police chief Erika Shields in a local newspaper interview.
The footage was ""lost and cannot be recovered"", said Ms Shields.
About one-third of all software used by city agencies and departments is believed to have been affected by the attack, which took place in March.
Details of the damage done to Atlanta's computer infrastructure emerged during a public meeting held to debate how the city should spend its budget.
The hearings revealed that the city has assigned an extra $9.5m (Â£7.1m) to finance its recovery efforts.
At the meeting, officials from the city administration revealed that the attack was more severe than originally thought.
More than 140 separate applications were totally or partially disabled by the attack, said Daphne Rackley who heads Atlanta's IT department. About 30% of the affected programs were ""mission critical"" as they were used by either the police or its courts, she said.
The municipal courts in Atlanta were shut for several weeks during the height of the attack and huge amounts of legal documents stretching back decades are believed to have been scrambled by the malware.
Police chief Shields told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that despite losing the video recordings, no ""crucial evidence"" had been compromised.
Dashcam footage was a ""useful tool"" said Ms Shields, but added that other evidence such as the testimony of an officer would ""make or break"" a case.
Files on individual officers' computers were also hit in the attack, although much of this data was backed up elsewhere, she said, so was not entirely lost.
The hackers behind the infection, known as SamSam, encrypted key data and demanded $51,000 of bitcoins to unlock it. Atlanta said it had not paid the ransom.",Yes
657,46,ransomware,Covid fraud: Â£34.5m stolen in pandemic scams,24 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56499886,"More than 6,000 cases of Covid-related fraud and cyber-crime have been recorded by the UK's police forces during the pandemic.
The Action Fraud team said Â£34.5m had been stolen since 1 March 2020.
It covers activity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland.
In a related development, the National Cyber Security Centre has told the BBC it is tackling about 30 ""significant attacks"" a month against the country's pandemic response infrastructure.
These involves attempts to breach the NHS, vaccine producers and vaccine supply chains, among other organisations.
""There unfortunately have been a number of successful ransomware incidents against businesses - I can think of roughly around 10,"" NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said.
Other figures disclosed by City of London Police, which co-ordinates efforts to combat fraud, include:
The activity peaked between April and May 2020, and January 2021 - both times when lockdowns were in force.
The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, which tackles criminal gangs responsible for financial fraud and scams, worked with social media platforms to take down over 700 accounts linked to fraudulent activity in 2020, of which over 250 were money mule recruiters.
But this may be the tip of the iceberg.
The National Crime Agency estimates that just one in five fraud cases are typically reported to the police.
And the volunteer-run Cyber Helpline told the BBC only a quarter of those who had contacted it after a cyber-attack said they had also reported the incident to the police.
Many of the scams involved conning people out of their money and financial details by focusing on internet shopping.
Related fraud was 42% higher over the pandemic than the preceding year, as criminals took advantage of the fact many physical stores had been forced to close.
Anna - not her real name - from Cheltenham was one of thousands of people who received an SMS message asking her to go online and rearrange a parcel delivery.
She filled in her details, but later suspected something was wrong. She alerted her bank and cancelled her bank card.
""I thought, now I have nothing to worry about, everything is fine and case closed,"" she told the BBC.
But the criminals used the details they had already obtained to authorise her bank to credit her account with a Â£9,000 loan.
And a short while later they called her, pretending to be the bank.
Not realising the scam, Anna told them she had not taken out a loan.
""They gave me the sort code and bank account number I needed to pay back the loan, and said if I paid the Â£9,000 there wouldn't be any charges.
""But then I was still feeling suspicious, so I Googled the sort code, and it came up with a completely different bank.""
So, Anna called her bank directly and realised the scammers had returned.
""I didn't lose any money but it did feel like a real burglary to be honest,"" she said.
She closed her account, and changed her email address and mobile number. But she still does not feel safe.
Charities are also common targets.
One in three charities suffered a cyber-attack during the first 10 months of the pandemic, according to Ecclesiastical Insurance.
One victim actually specialises in offering cyber-security advice to others.
Hackers got inside Charity Digital's network for seven days without being detected. They compromised its email accounts and sent false invoices to clients.
The organisation's chief executive, Jonathan Chevallier, told the BBC the breach had not been noticed in part because all his staff had been working from home.
Charity Digital spent more than Â£10,000 investigating the attack and has produced an online webinar to help others avoid a similar fate.
Another popular type of cyber-fraud involved romance scams, in which people looking for relationships via the net often get fooled into sending money to prospective partners, who prey on their emotions.
This type of crime was 20% more common over the past year than the one before.
City of London Police also said key workers had also been specifically targeted.
In one case, a man was arrested on suspicion of using social media to advertise bogus car insurance policies to NHS workers.
The pandemic appears, however, to have coincided with a fall in one type of cyber-crime.
Reported cases of computer software service fraud - in which criminals call offering fake tech support to fool victims into sharing their payment card details and other credentials - dropped by 15.5%.",Yes
658,47,ransomware,Ransomware infects Ukraine energy ministry website,24 April 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43877677,"Hackers have used ransomware to take the website of Ukraine's energy ministry offline and encrypt its files.
The website currently contains a message written in English, demanding a ransom of 0.1 bitcoin - worth $927.86 (Â£664.98) by today's exchange rate.
Ukranian cyber-police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko said the attack is an ""isolated incident"" and no other government websites have been affected.
She added that the energy ministry's email system was still up and running.
""This case is not large-scale. If necessary, we are ready to react and help,"" said Ms Kvitko.
""Our specialists are working right now... We do not know how long it will take to resolve the issue.""
According to cyber-security research firm AlienVault, the hackers behind this cyber-attack have previously compromised other websites, but they have only made about Â£100 from their efforts.
AlienVault believes the energy ministry website has been attacked by two different hackers - the first hacker, who signs his name ""X-zakaria"" at the bottom of the webpage, merely defaced the website.
The security firm believes that a second hacker then came along, encrypted the website's files, and added a ransomware screen and payment details.
""What has probably happened here is that a hacktivist has hacked the site for fun, then the criminal ransomware attacker has used their backdoor, which you can see at the bottom of the page, to try and make some money,"" AlienVault security researcher Chris Doman told the BBC.
He said that it was likely that these hackers were amateurs, rather than nation state attackers.
""It's certainly true that attacks against Ukraine have impersonated ransomware before, to cover their true aim of pure destruction, and in many cases, energy companies such as this have been a prime target,"" said Mr Doman.
""However, in this case the evidence points to something more mundane.""",Yes
659,48,ransomware,Cyber criminals demand ransom to unlock Sepa systems,14 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-55661248,"The environmental regulator Sepa says criminals are demanding a ransom to unlock its digital systems which have been subjected to a cyber attack since Christmas Eve.
It said international groups were likely to be behind the ransomware attack that has locked its emails and contacts centre.
More than 1GB of data has been stolen, including information about staff.
Police Scotland and the National Cyber Security Centre are investigating.
Cyber security specialists have identified the theft of about 1.2 GB of data with indications suggesting that at least 4,000 files may have been accessed and stolen.
The company's internal communications have also been locked but but Sepa said ""priority regulatory, monitoring, flood forecasting and warning services were continuing to adapt and operate"".
Sepa (Scottish Environment Protection Agency) said a number of systems, including email, would remain badly affected for some time and it was likely that new systems would have to be built from scratch.
Information submitted to Sepa by email since Christmas Eve is not currently accessible.
This has been an incredibly sophisticated attack on Scotland's environmental regulator which has locked their IT systems and crippled them now for three weeks.
We know that the cyber criminals have been in touch demanding money but it seems unlikely they will succeed.
There's no suggestion climate change activism is at the heart of this ransomware attack, even though it's the environmental regulator being targeted.
The hack has all the hallmarks of Russian organised cyber criminals - although Sepa will not confirm that.
Critical services like flood forecasting are unaffected but entire systems will have to be rebuilt and it's unlikely the 1,300 workers will be able to get access to their old emails and online files.
The agency confirmed last week that following the attack at 00:01 on Christmas Eve, business continuity arrangements were immediately enacted and the agency's emergency management team was working with Scottish government, Police Scotland and the National Cyber Security Centre to respond to ""complex and sophisticated criminality"".
Sepa's chief executive Terry A'Hearn said: ""Partners have confirmed that Sepa remains subject to an ongoing ransomware attack likely to be by international serious and organised cyber-crime groups intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds.
""Work continues by cyber security specialists to seek to identify what the stolen data was. Whilst we don't know and may never know the full detail of the 1.2 GB of information stolen, what we know is that early indications suggest that the theft of information related to a number of business areas.
""Some of the information stolen will have been publicly available, whilst some will not have been.""
He said direct contact would be made as quickly as possible with affected organisations.
Mr A'Hearn added that staff members affected were being supported and given access to specialist advice and services.
Det Insp Michael McCullagh, of Police Scotland's cybercrime investigations unit, said: ""This remains an ongoing investigation. Police Scotland are working closely with Sepa and our partners at Scottish government and the wider UK law enforcement community to investigate and provide support in response to this incident.
""Inquiries remain at an early stage and continue to progress including deployment of specialist cybercrime resources to support this response.
""It would be inappropriate to provide more specific detail of investigations at this time.""",Yes
660,49,ransomware,Hackers threaten to leak plastic surgery pictures,24 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55439190,"Hackers have stolen the data of a large cosmetic surgery chain and are threatening to publish patients' before and after photos, among other details.
The Hospital Group, which has a long list of celebrity endorsements, has confirmed the ransomware attack.
It said it had informed the Information Commissioner of the breach.
On its darknet webpage, the hacker group known as REvil said the ""intimate photos of customers"" were ""not a completely pleasant sight"".
It claimed to have obtained more than 900 gigabytes of patient photographs.
The Hospital Group, which is also known as the Transform Hospital Group, claims to be the UK's leading specialist weight loss and cosmetic surgery group.
It has 11 clinics specialising in bariatric weight loss surgery, breast enlargements, nipple corrections and nose adjustments.
The company has previously promoted itself via celebrity endorsements, although it has not done so for several years.
Former Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace told Zoo magazine about her breast enhancement surgery with The Hospital Group in 2009.
Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona, Shameless actress Tina Malone and reality TV star Joey Essex from The Only Way is Essex are also previous patients who have endorsed the clinic.
The Hospital Group said in a statement: ""We can confirm that our IT systems have been subject to aâ¯data security breach. None of our patients' payment card details have been compromised but at this stage, we understand that some of our patients' personal data may have been accessed.""
The company said it had emailed all its customers about the cyber-attack and would contact individuals who might have had more personal details compromised.
It's understood that many before and after pictures will not include the patients' faces.
One customer told the BBC he was worried about his pictures and data being in the hackers' hands.
Simon Hails had chest reduction surgery with The Hospital Group.
He said the company had not told him about the ransom.
""I have had an email from The Hospital Group informing me of a 'data security incident' but no detail as to what has been hacked,"" he told the BBC.
""I'm obviously concerned as the last thing I want is 'before photos' being splattered around in the public domain. I've tried to keep my surgery private and not even some of my friends and colleagues know about it, so the data breach is concerning for me.""
Ransomware is one of the most prolific forms of cyber-attack. It typically involves hackers gaining access to a computer network and either encrypting files or locking users out of their systems until a ransom is paid.
More recently, ransomware gangs have been taking a copy of the data and threatening to release it.
Law-enforcement agencies discourage victims from paying the ransom because doing so fuels the criminal enterprises.
Cyber-security company Emsisoft estimates that the burgeoning form of cyber-crime has earned criminals $25bn (Â£18bn) in 2020.
REvil, also known as Sodinokibi, is one of the most prolific ransomware groups. Its high-profile victims include currency exchange Travelex and entertainment law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks.
In September, The Hospital Group said surgery requests had increased by 25% since 2019.

662,51,ransomware,Cyber attack: Hackers post Hackney Council's 'stolen documents',7 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55574580,"A cyber criminal group has posted what it claims are documents stolen from Hackney Council in a ransomware attack.
The publication on the dark web of the personal details of council staff and residents follows ""a serious cyber-attack"" on the council in October.
Experts said the data was ""limited"" and ""not visible through search engines"".
Officials continue to work with the UK National Cyber Security Centre and National Crime Agency to investigate the hack, the council said.
Hackney Council's cabinet member for planning, Guy Nicholson, said the hack had affected services residents relied on, including by disrupting the ability of the council to process land search requests for those buying property.
Many residents have complained on social media about how the disruption has cost them financially and derailed house purchases.
Jessica told the BBC the hack broke the chain on her and many other people's house purchases.
She told the BBC: ""It's extremely frustrating as the hack has ruined our plans and cost us money that we'll never get back. The sale of our property fell through because our buyer wasn't able to carry out a search on our house so couldn't get a mortgage.
""Subsequently we lost the house we were planning on buying and had already spent more than Â£1,000 on a survey for.
""We were hoping to have the house sorted in time to make use of the stamp duty holiday, but that's not looking likely.""
The council said the vast majority of sensitive or personal information held by the council remained unaffected.
It added that it would support any directly affected people.
Hackney's mayor Philip Glanville said the hack was ""utterly deplorable"".
""I fully understand and share the concern of residents and staff about any risk to their personal data, and we are working as quickly as possible with our partners to assess the data and take action, including informing people who are affected,"" he said.
""While we believe this publication will not directly affect the vast majority of Hackney's residents and businesses, we are sorry for the worry and upset this will cause them.
""We are already working closely with the police and other partners to assess any immediate actions we need to take, and will share further information about the additional action we will be taking as soon as we can.""
In February last year, another local authority - Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council - was hit by a ransomware attack, which cost it more than Â£10m.
This attack has caused real-world harm to residents.
The fact that people are out of pocket and have had life plans derailed because of a lack of land searches is a side effect to councils being hacked that few could have predicted.
The authority isn't saying much, including whether or not they have negotiated with hackers or paid a ransom.
Now that the hackers are posting data from their attack on the dark web, it appears we can deduce that they have not got what they wanted.
But we don't know for sure, and this hacker group is notorious for posting or selling data even after promising victims they wouldn't.
Ransomware experts at cyber security firm Emsisoft also tell me that the group, known as Mespinoza, are famously very amateurish.
Even if Hackney Council did pay, I'm told the data would likely be far too damaged and scrambled to recover.",Yes
663,52,ransomware,Global ransomware attack causes turmoil,28 June 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40416611,"Companies across the globe are reporting that they have been struck by a major ransomware cyber-attack.
British advertising agency WPP is among those to say its IT systems have been disrupted as a consequence.
The virus, the source of which is not yet known, freezes the user's computer and demands an untraceable ransom be paid in the digital Bitcoin currency.
Ukrainian firms, including the state power company and Kiev's main airport, were among the first to report issues.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has also had to monitor radiation levels manually after its Windows-based sensors were shut down.
In a statement, the US National Security Council said government agencies were investigating the attack and that the US was ""determined to hold those responsible accountable"".
The US Department of Homeland Security advised victims not to pay the ransom, saying there was no guarantee that access to files would be restored.
The Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab said its analysis showed that there had been about 2,000 attacks - most in Ukraine, Russia and Poland.
The international police organisation Interpol has said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation and liaising with its member countries.
Experts suggest the malware is taking advantage of the same weaknesses used by the WannaCry attack last month.
""It initially appeared to be a variant of a piece of ransomware that emerged last year,"" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward.
""The ransomware was called Petya and the updated version Petrwrap.
""However, now that's not so clear.""
Kaspersky Lab reported that it believed the malware was a ""new ransomware that has not been seen before"" despite its resemblance to Petya.
As a result, the firm has dubbed it NotPetya. Kaspersky added that it had detected suspected attacks in Poland, Italy, Germany, France and the US in addition to the UK, Russia and Ukraine.
Andrei Barysevich, a spokesman for security firm Recorded Future, told the BBC such attacks would not stop because cyber-thieves found them too lucrative.
""A South Korean hosting firm just paid $1m to get their data back and that's a huge incentive,"" he said. ""It's the biggest incentive you could offer to a cyber-criminal.""
A bitcoin wallet associated with the outbreak has received several payments since the outbreak began. The wallet currently holds just over 3.5 bitcoins (Â£6,775; $8,670).
An email address associated with the blackmail attempt has been blocked by German independent email provider Posteo.
It means that the blackmailers have not been able to access the mailbox.
Problems have also affected:
The attacks come two months after another global ransomware assault, known as WannaCry, which caused major problems for the UK's National Health Service.
Veteran security expert Chris Wysopal from Veracode said the malware seemed to be spreading via some of the same Windows code loopholes exploited by WannaCry. Many firms did not patch those holes because WannaCry was tackled so quickly, he added.
Those being caught out were also industrial firms that often struggled to apply software patches quickly.
""These organisations typically have a challenge patching all of their machines because so many systems cannot have down time,"" he said. ""Airports also have this challenge.""
Copies of the virus have been submitted to online testing systems that check if security software, particularly anti-virus systems, were able to spot and stop it.
""Only two vendors were able to detect it so many systems are defenceless if they are unpatched and relying on anti-virus,"" he said.
Ukraine seems to have been particularly badly hit this time round.
Reports suggest that the Kiev metro system has stopped accepting payment cards while several chains of petrol stations have suspended operations.
Ukraine's deputy prime minister has tweeted a picture appearing to show government systems have been affected.
His caption reads: ""Ta-daaa! Network is down at the Cabinet of Minister's secretariat.""

Also included are initialisms used on the online parenting forum Mumsnet such as TTC - meaning trying to conceive.
OED senior editor Fi Mooring said the words chosen will resonate ""even with people who are not parents"".
The dictionary consults experts to determine what should be added to its 829,000 words.
The OED is updated four times a year with the next update due in April 2018.
Mansplaining is defined as explaining something ""needlessly, overbearingly, or condescendingly, especially to a woman, in a manner thought to reveal a patronising or chauvinistic attitude"".
Researchers date early usage of that term to an internet exchange between a man and a woman in 2008.
Although hangry has only come into common usage recently the word dates back to 1956 when it appeared in a psychoanalytic journal.
The OED defines the new term snowflake as a description of someone who is ""overly sensitive or as feeling entitled to special treatment or consideration"".
Ransomware is another new addition - less than a year since the NHS was one of a number of global institutions targeted by the WannaCry cyber attack that was carried out with the use of malicious software.
Chaebol is formed by combining the Korean words chae, meaning wealth, and bol, meaning faction and, in South Korea, means a large business conglomerate.
However, recently the word has been used to describe a luxurious lifestyle associated with families who own such businesses.
The new list sees American rapper Jay-Z get his sixth OED citation with the word swag being added to the dictionary.
Swag, derived from the word swagger, describes a bold, self-confident manner and appeared in Jay-Z's Black Album: ""My self-esteem went through the roof, man. I got my swag.""
Here are some of his other citations:
""My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese.""
Cheese is American slang for money.
""We stand for hours waiting for bricks of government cheese.""
Government cheese is a colloquial term for welfare benefits.
""We grow up knowing people who pay for everything with little plastic cardsâMedicare cards for checkups, EBT cards for food.""
EBT stands for electronic benefits transfer - a system of paying out benefits with a card used in the US.

665,54,ransomware,Ransomware behind NHS Lanarkshire cyber-attack,28 August 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-41076591,"It has been confirmed that ransomware was behind a cyber-attack on a Scottish health board which led to some appointments and procedures being cancelled.
NHS Lanarkshire said it was a new variant of Bitpaymer that infected its network on Friday.
The board said staff worked over the weekend to reinstate IT systems.
Work is ongoing to establish how the malware was able to infiltrate the network without being detected.
The cyber-attack started on Friday. Operations were cancelled and the work of GPs was disrupted.
Ransomware is a particularly destructive form of malware that catastrophically struck the NHS earlier this year.
While this new infection is not the notorious Wannacry variation, which caused global chaos, it is yet another demonstration of how disruptive ransomware can be.
What it does is encrypt the data it finds on a host computer so that it can no longer be accessed, and then demands payment, often in Bitcoin, for its release.
Experts recommend resorting to back-up files rather than paying the ransom itself as there's no guarantee that the criminals behind it will keep to their word - but there are many examples of cases where individuals and organisations have chosen to part with their cash.
Most malware travels via phishing emails - something that looks like it's from a trusted source and asks the recipient to click a link. It only takes a moment of being caught off-guard to be taken in.
The best defence is to keep software updated and use anti-virus protection but it can be difficult for large organisations like the NHS to implement this en-masse, when complicated, life-saving equipment is running off a network that may not adjust well to even minor tweaks.
NHS Lanarkshire chief executive Calum Campbell said: ""We quickly identified the source of the malware and investigations are ongoing as to how this was able to infiltrate our network.
""Our staff have worked hard to minimise the impact on patients and our contingency plans have ensured we have been able to continue to deliver services while the IT issues were resolved. A small number of systems were affected with the majority restored over the weekend and the remainder on Monday.""
""Unfortunately a small number of procedures and appointments were cancelled as a result of the incident. I would like to apologise to anyone who has been affected by this disruption. We immediately started work to reappoint patients to the earliest possible appointments.""
The health board said it was working with its IT security providers to establish how the malware had infiltrated the network.
A spokesman added: ""Our security software and systems were up to date with the latest signature files, but as this was a new malware variant the latest security software was unable to detect it.
""Following analysis of the malware our security providers issued an updated signature so that this variant can now be detected and blocked.""

666,55,ransomware,NHS 'could have prevented' WannaCry ransomware attack,27 October 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41753022,"NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major ransomware attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said.
More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).
At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack.
NHS England said no patient data had been compromised or stolen and praised the staff response.
The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now ""get their act together"".
WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date.
The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to Â£230 ($300).
The NAO report said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown.
An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards.
The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.
The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said.
""Before 12 May 2017, the department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance.""
Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said.
NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry.
NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware.
But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected.
Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.
It is not known:
The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry.
His ""kill switch"" involved registering a domain name linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically.
Home Office Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was ""as sure as possible"" that North Korea was behind the attack.
""This attack, we believe quite strongly that it came from a foreign state,"" he said.
""It is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea [took on] this role"".
Speaking on the same programme, former chairman of NHS Digital, Kingsley Manning, said that a failure to upgrade old computer systems at a local level within the NHS had contributed to the rapid spread of the malware.
He said: ""The problem with cyber security for the NHS is [that] it has a particular vulnerability... It's very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread.""
Mr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also ""frankly a lack of focus, a lack of taking it seriously"" for individual NHS organisations' failure to keep up with cyber-security improvements.
""This was an extremely unsophisticated attack,"" he added.
The NAO said the NHS ""has accepted that there are lessons to learn"" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan.
It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.
WannaCry was ""a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice,"" said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO.
""There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks.""
Keith McNeil, NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care, said: ""As the NAO report makes clear, no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen.
""Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum.""
For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.
So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.
To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts. When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.
Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS. Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.
In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.
Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem. And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.",Yes
667,56,ransomware,"Capcom hack: Up to 350,000 people's information stolen",16 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54958782,"Video-game-maker Capcom has warned a ransomware attack might have compromised gamers' personal information.
Up to 350,000 people could be affected, it said, and some of its own financial information had been stolen.
The Japanese developer is best known for franchises such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Monster Hunter.
A week-and-a-half earlier, it had said there was no indication customer information had been accessed.
But in an update on Monday, Capcom confirmed its servers had been hit by an attack on 2 November.
Ransomware is malicious software that typically threatens to block a victim's access to their own records unless a blackmail payment is made.
In this case, the attackers digitally scrambled some of the data on Capcom's servers, making it impossible to view or amend, and destroyed some files outright.
The Ragnar Locker hacker group had then demanded to be paid to undo the encryption involved, Capcom said.
On Ragnor Locker's dark-net webpage, the hackers didn't just post Capcom's data but also an ominous message.
In broken English they wrote the Japanese company didn't ""make a right decision and save data from leakage"".
This - and the fact Capcom is openly talking about the hack - suggests the company chose not to pay the cyber-criminals' extortion demand.
Many, including law enforcement, would actually see this as absolutely the right decision.
For 18 months, police the world over have been desperately imploring ransomware victims not to pay hackers.
The groups have made millions from companies, which often feel they have no other option but to fork out.
But it seems Capcom has found a way through without yielding.
No doubt the incident has affected the firm's reputation and some sensitive data is already surfacing online.
But reading the disappointment in Ragnor Locker's statement is refreshing and rare.
So far, Capcom has confirmed only nine people's personal information was definitely compromised, all current or former employees.
But up to 350,000 customers, business partners, and other employees might also be affected, it said.
Although, it could not be sure because its own logs had been ""lost as a result of the attack"".
The information includes different combinations of names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers and email addresses, depending on why the data was gathered.
For example, some was from Japanese customer support and some from the American Capcom store or e-sports operation.
""None of the at-risk data contains credit-card information,"" Capcom's statement said.
""All online transactions... are handled by a third-party service provider.
""And as such, Capcom does not maintain any such information internally.""
The company also said it was safe for gamers to continue to play its games online and to use its websites.
Police have been notified, as have the Japanese and UK data-protection watchdogs.
""Capcom would once again like to reiterate its deepest apologies for any complications or concerns caused by this incident,"" it said.
""As a company that handles digital content, it is regarding this incident with the utmost seriousness.""",Yes

The malware has affected systems at three Russian websites, an airport in Ukraine and an underground railway in the capital city, Kiev.
The cyber-police chief in Ukraine confirmed to the Reuters news agency that Bad Rabbit was the ransomware in question.
It bears similarities to the WannaCry and Petya outbreaks earlier this year.
However, it is not yet known how far this new malware will be able to spread.
""In some of the companies, the work has been completely paralysed - servers and workstations are encrypted,"" head of Russian cyber-security firm Group-IB, Ilya Sachkov, told the TASS news agency.
Two of the affected sites are Interfax and Fontanka.ru.
Meanwhile, US officials said they had ""received multiple reports of Bad Rabbit ransomware infections in many countries around the world"".
The US computer emergency readiness team said it ""discourages individuals and organisations from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored"".
Who was affected?
By Ksenia Idrisova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina, BBC Monitoring
Initial news reports mentioned Russian media websites, such as St Petersburg-based Fontanka.ru, as well as an airport in Ukraine's Odessa and a subway system in Kiev.
Privately-owned Russian news agency Interfax was hit particularly hard, to the extent that 24 hours later its website still displayed a message reading ""our service is temporary unavailable"".
On the morning of 25 October, it transpired that Russian banks had also been targeted but, luckily, were not compromised.
The Russian Central Bank said in a statement that it had recorded a BadRabbit attack on Russian financial institutions, but that none of them had been compromised, as reported by RNS news agency on 25 October.
Otkrytiye, formerly Russia's biggest privately-owned bank, was one of the Russian financial institutions that repelled the attack, according to RNS.
Prominent Russian IT security firm Group-IB reported that BadRabbit had targeted several of the top 20 Russian banks but failed to penetrate their networks.
""According to our data, most of the victims targeted by these attacks are located in Russia,"" said Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky at Kaspersky Lab.
""We have also seen similar but fewer attacks in Ukraine, Turkey and Germany.""
Bad Rabbit encrypts the contents of a computer and asks for a payment - in this case 0.05 bitcoins, or about $280 (Â£213).
Cyber-security firms, including Russia-based Kaspersky, have said they are monitoring the attack.
The malware is still undetected by the majority of anti-virus programs, according to analysis by virus checking site Virus Total.
One security firm, Eset, has said that the malware was distributed via a bogus Adobe Flash update.
Researcher Kevin Beaumont has posted a screenshot that shows Bad Rabbit creating tasks in Windows named after the dragons Drogon and Rhaegal in TV series Game of Thrones.

669,58,ransomware,Cyber attack targets Norwich-based Flagship Group,5 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-54824740,"Customer and staff data has been ""compromised"" in a security breach of a social housing provider's IT system.
Flagship Group, based in Norwich, said the cyber attack on 1 November took ""most of our group's systems offline"".
It said the incident had been caused by a suspected phishing or ransomware attack.
It said it had closed down its online systems while it was investigated, and had reported the breach to police and the Information Commissioner's Office.
On its website it said: ""Despite our quick action, there has been some data encryption and some personal customer and staff data has been compromised.
""We do not yet have a complete picture of all the data that has been encrypted.""
The company also said it had ""a high level of security measures"" in place to protect data.
Flagship Group owns some 31,000 homes in the East of England and employs 1,200 people in its facilities, repairs, maintenance and heating departments.
In 2017-18, it had an annual turnover of Â£133.7m
It has tenants in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge and Essex and also builds and sells houses to private owners.
Chief executive David McQuade apologised to tenants affected by the breach and those experiencing delays in having repairs carried out.
""We are now working towards the recovery of all our systems,"" he said.
""The incident has caused considerable disruption to our staff and customer services and we are concentrating on emergency situations, to ensure our customers are safe.""
The firm said the matter had also been reported to the Regulator of Social Housing.
Norfolk Police said it was being dealt with by the National Cyber Security Centre.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) confirmed it had been informed.

672,61,ransomware,Top university under 'ransomware' cyber-attack,15 June 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40288548,"University College London, one of the world's leading universities, has been hit by a major cyber-attack.
The university describes it as a ""ransomware"" attack, such as last month's cyber-attack which threatened NHS computer systems.
The attack was continuing on Thursday, with access to online networks being restricted.
The university has warned staff and students of the risk of data loss and ""very substantial disruption"".
University College London (UCL) is a ""centre of excellence in cyber-security research"", a status awarded by the GCHQ intelligence and monitoring service.
The central London university, ranked last week in the world's top 10, says that a ""widespread ransomware attack"" began on Wednesday.
It was first blamed on so-called ""phishing"" emails, with links to destructive software.
But later the university suggested it was more likely to be from contact with a ""compromised"" website, where clicking on a pop-up page might have spread a malware infection.
Ransomware attacks are where computer systems are locked and threatened with damaging software unless payments are made.
Students and staff were warned that ""ransomware damages files on your computer and on shared drives where you save files"" and were told not to open any suspicious attachments.
The university says that it believes the risk of further infection has been contained, but it is urging staff and students to help with efforts to reduce any ""further spread of this malware"".
Universities, which often carry out commercially sensitive research, have become frequent targets for cyber-attacks.
""However, what makes this attack interesting is the timing,"" said Graham Rymer, an ethical hacker and research associate at the University of Cambridge.
""Hackers tend to target people who will be desperate to get access to their data and are, therefore, more likely to pay the ransom.
""Currently there are a lot of students who will be putting the final touches to their dissertations, so it could be that they were the targets.""
Mr Rymer said UCL seemed to have responded well to the attack and had ""locked it down pretty well"".
""One thing UCL did is to quickly switch all drives in the system to ""read-only"" following the attack, which essentially prevented the malware from doing real damage.""
Mr Rymer said UCL may not have been the only intended target as he had seen other businesses facing the same malware.

673,62,ransomware,Emotet botnet taken down by international police swoop,27 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55826258,"Police have seized thousands of computers running one of the most dangerous hacking networks worldwide.
The Emotet network obtains access to victims' computers, via malicious email attachments, then sells it to criminals who install more dangerous malware.
Police from the UK, EU, US and Canada worked together to ""disrupt"" Emotet.
Europol called it ""one of most significant botnets of the past decade"" and one of the main ""door openers"" for computer systems worldwide.
""Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware,"" it said.
Dmitry Smilyanets, from Recorded Future, said: ""Even if the creator and his support and operators are not arrested, they likely will not try to rebuild.
""They have enough cash to retire in peace - or start a new criminal adventure.
""A working botnet is a very complicated and gentle system.
""If more than a half of the infrastructure is not working, it's safe to say bye-bye.""
Emotet was initially a banking trojan, designed to spy on victims' computers and steal login details.
Victims would receive an apparently important Word document marked for their attention.
When opened, it would ask them to ""enable Macros"" - a seemingly innocent feature built into Microsoft Word that actually opened their computer up to attackers.
Lotem Finkelstein, of Check Point Software, said it had been tracking Emotet for years.
""The most successful and prevalent malware of 2020 by a long way"", he said, it had, over the course of the year, sent phishing emails with more than 150,000 different subject lines and 100,000 file names for the attachments.
""It constantly adjusted its phishing emails to victims' interests and global events - for example, the Covid-19 pandemic or major shopping seasons such as Black Friday,"" Mr Finkelstein said.
And although the Europol announcement may seem ""abstract"", it would protect ""the public from cyber-threats that have caused losses of millions, if not more, of dollars"".",Yes

675,64,ransomware,Ransomware cyber-attack threat escalating - Europol,14 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39913630,"Friday's cyber-attack has affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries, Europol chief Rob Wainwright says.
He told the BBC the act was ""unprecedented in its scale"" and warned more people could find themselves affected on Monday morning.
The virus took control of users' files, demanding payments; Russia and the UK were among the worst-hit countries.
Experts say another attack could be imminent and have warned people to ensure their security is up to date.
Mr Wainwright said that the ransomware - software that blocks access to data until a ransom is paid - was combined with a worm application - a program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.
This, he said, was allowing the ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"".
He added: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time.""
Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the ransomware, he said.
Companies need to make sure they have updated their systems and ""patched where they should"" before staff arrived for work on Monday morning, the EU law enforcement agency head said.
In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, GP surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.
What occurred was an ""indiscriminate attack across the world on multiple industries and services"", Mr Wainwright said, including Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry.
However, he said that so far ""remarkably"" few payments had been made by victims of the attack.
BBC analysis of three accounts linked with the global attack suggests the hackers have been paid the equivalent of Â£22,080.
The Europol chief said his agency was working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to find those responsible, and that more than one person was likely to be involved.
The virus exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software, first identified by the US National Security Agency, experts have said.
After taking computers over, it displayed messages demanding a payment of $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock files and return them to the user.
Microsoft released security updates last month to address the vulnerability, with another patch released on Friday.
The UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".
MalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.
The 22-year-old told the BBC it was very important for people to patch their systems as soon as possible.",Yes
676,65,ransomware,WannaCry ransomware bitcoins move from online wallets,3 August 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40811972,"More than $140,000 (Â£105,000) worth of bitcoins paid by victims of the WannaCry ransomware outbreak have been removed from their online wallets.
It has been nearly three months since infections struck organisations worldwide, including the NHS, which faced days of disruption as a result.
The bitcoin activity was noticed by a Twitter bot set up by Quartz journalist Keith Collins.
The balance of all wallets known to be associated with WannaCry is now zero.
The ransomware hit many businesses hard, quickly infecting multiple computers on corporate networks and encrypting them so they became useless.
Victims were asked to pay between $300 and $600 to get their systems back.
Back in May, many cyber-security experts and law enforcement agencies advised victims that paying the ransom would probably only encourage other cyber-criminals and not result in restored access to computers.
However, many clearly decided to take a chance.
According to bitcoin-monitoring company Elliptic, an initial portion of the WannaCry funds were moved in late July.
And at about 04:10 BST on Thursday, the vast majority were finally withdrawn in entirety.
Many watchers expect that the WannaCry bitcoins will be put through a ""mixer"" - in which the currency is transferred and mixed into a larger series of payments that make it much harder to track where it ends up.
But the incident has left some cyber-security experts confused.
""I have no idea why they would move that money to be honest,"" said Andy Patel at F-Secure.
""I wouldn't imagine that they are going to try and turn those bitcoins into real money. If they do, it's going to give someone a way to track them to an actual person.""
Instead, Mr Patel told the BBC the funds could be used to pay for dark web services that might leave less of a digital paper trail.
In July, bitcoins paid as ransom following a separate attack - NotPetya - were moved from their online wallets.
Many people assume Bitcoin is anonymous: the online equivalent of cash. However, every transaction is completely visible to anyone who cares to look.
There are even online sites that allow you to view what is happening in the blockchain - the distributed ledger that records all bitcoin movements.
The blockchain is more like a Swiss bank account: you know the account number and which account transfers money to which other accounts, but you don't necessarily know who stands behind that account number.
A technique called ""cluster analysis"" looks across all of these bitcoin addresses and attempts to find addresses that are being used by the same people.
Then, some of the other transactions in that cluster, which were not intended to be anonymous, can provide evidence of who owns those addresses.
Law enforcement agencies often use this classic approach to track criminals - the idea, of course, is: ""Follow the money.""

677,66,ransomware,"Ransomware 'here to stay', warns Google study",27 July 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40737060,"Cyber-thieves have made at least $25m (Â£19m) from ransomware in the last two years, suggests research by Google.
The search giant created thousands of virtual victims of ransomware to expose the payment ecosystem surrounding the malware type.
Most of the money was made in 2016 as gangs realised how lucrative it was, revealed a talk at Black Hat.
Two types of ransomware made most of the money, it said, but other variants are starting to emerge.
""It's become a very, very profitable market and is here to stay,"" said Elie Bursztein from Google who, along with colleagues Kylie McRoberts and Luca Invernizzi, carried out the research.
Ransomware is malicious software that infects a machine and then encrypts or scrambles files so they can no longer be used or read. The files are only decrypted when a victim pays a ransom. Payments typically have to be made using the Bitcoin virtual currency.
Mr Bursztein said Google used several different methods to work out how much cash was flowing towards ransomware creators.
As well as drawing on reports from people who had paid a ransom, it sought out the files used to infect machines and then ran those on lots of virtual machines to generate ""synthetic victims"", he said.
Cyber-hacks season:
It then monitored the network traffic generated by these victims to work out to where money would be transferred. The data gathered in this stage was also used to find more variants of ransomware and the 300,000 files it found broke down into 34 of them, he said.
The most popular strains were the Locky and Cerber families, added Mr Bursztein.
Payment analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain, which logs all transactions made using the e-currency, revealed that those two strains also made the most money over the last year, he said, with Locky collecting about $7.8m (Â£5.9m) and Cerber $6.9m (Â£5.2m).
The research project also revealed where the cash flowed and accumulated in the Bitcoin network and where it was converted back into cash. More than 95% of Bitcoin payments for ransomware  were cashed out via Russia's BTC-e exchange, found Google.
On 26 July, one of the founders of BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested by Greek police on money laundering charges. The police were acting on a US warrant and his extradition to America is being sought.
The gangs behind the ransomware explosion were not likely to stop soon, said Mr Bursztein, although established strains are facing competition from newer ones.
""Ransomware is a fast-moving market,"" he said. ""There's aggressive competition coming from variants such as SamSam and Spora.""
Novel variants were expanding quickly and many were encouraging fast expansion by paying affiliates more if they placed the malware on to large numbers of machines. The ransomware as a service model was already proving popular, he warned.
""It's no longer a game reserved for tech-savvy criminals,"" he said. ""It's for almost anyone.""

678,67,ransomware,iPhone users fooled by fake ransomware,29 March 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39432350,"Apple has issued an iPhone software update after reports of fake ransomware attacks where money was demanded in order to unlock the handset's browser.
A pop-up screen accused the phone owner of accessing illegal pornography or pirating music and could not be removed.
However the ransomware was fake - and clearing the browser cache was actually enough to restore full access.
It ran on JavaScript, a code commonly employed by many websites.
The attackers demanded Â£100 in the form of an iTunes gift card with the code sent via text message to a designated mobile number, said security firm Lookout in a blog about the malware.
""...the attack doesn't actually encrypt any data and hold it ransom,"" wrote its security researchers.
""Its purpose is to scare the victim into paying to unlock the browser before he realizes he doesn't have to pay the ransom to recover data or access the browser.""
The patch closed the loophole but Professor Alan Woodward, cybersecurity expert at Surrey University said some iPhone users have put off the update because it also includes other changes to the running of the device.
""Some people have held off thinking it sounds fairly major, but obviously if they do that they won't get the protection,"" he said.

679,68,ransomware,WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack: Your questions answered,16 May 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39926855,"After a cyber-attack disrupted IT services across the globe, many people have written to the BBC with questions about why it happened, how you can protect your computers and smartphones, and if the attackers will be caught.
BBC Technology reporter Chris Foxx and security expert Prof Alan Woodward provide some answers.
WannaCry ransomware cyber-attacks slow but fears remain
""Practically speaking, it's not possible to completely isolate the NHS network,"" said cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward.
""The NHS sends emails to patients who have email addresses outside of the NHS network.
""People in the NHS also use the internet heavily for research, just like academics.""
Even a private network can be compromised, especially in an organisation with thousands of people using it daily.
""Once [a virus] has managed to enter the larger network, it can then use vulnerabilities to spread,"" said Prof Woodward.
Since serving customers online is now part of banks' bread and butter, you would expect cyber-security to be at the very top of their priorities.
Cyber-security is a game of cat and mouse, with criminals always thinking of new ways to attack systems, so no organisation is totally impenetrable.
This ransomware outbreak is mostly likely to affect your finances if you get infected and pay the ransom, which security experts say you should not do.
There is absolutely no guarantee the criminals would give your files back.
If you run a business, there is detailed guidance on the National Cyber Security Centre website you can follow to make sure your company is protected.
Microsoft has already identified the way this specific strain of ransomware spread from device to device, and has issued a issued a fix.
As long as your operating system is up-to-date, you should be protected from this strain of ransomware.
Always make sure you are running the latest version of your operating system with the latest security fixes installed - and run up-to-date anti-virus software from a trusted company.
Although this strain of ransomware was not spread by email, always beware suspicious emails asking you to click links or download attachments.
Criminals will often use a widely publicised virus outbreak to send scam emails, pretending to offer help.
To prevent heartbreak, if the worst comes to the worst you should keep a backup copy of important files, photos and videos on an external hard drive.
Make sure to disconnect the drive from your computer after making your backup, so ransomware can't access it if your computer is infected.
""The bottom line is that all you can really do is keep your software, including your virus checker, up to date. Ideally have updates set to automatic,"" said Prof Woodward.
The purpose of a ransomware attack is to extort money from victims.
It is a powerful attack because people may fear losing their documents and photographs and so may be more likely to pay.
When it hits businesses and hospitals, there is extra pressure to get rid of the ransomware quickly.
The government has said the ransomware outbreak at the NHS was not a targeted attack on the UK's health service.
It may be that the attackers created their virus without knowing exactly how far it would spread.
No. This strain of ransomware was spread from device to device by taking advantage of an old security hole in some versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system.
The hole is fixed in the latest versions of Windows.
However, ransomware can be spread in rogue email attachments, so do not click links or open attachments in unsolicited emails.
""Practice ABC - assume nothing, believe no-one, check everything,"" says Prof Woodward.
Yes, every operating system could theoretically be attacked. Criminals tend to target systems such as Windows or the Android mobile operating system, because they are more widely used, increasing the chance of people falling victim.
In the same way that a burglar breaking into a home can cover their tracks, cyber-criminals can go to great lengths to hide their identity.
However, many cyber-criminals have been caught and brought to justice - and the UK's National Crime Agency, Europol and the FBI are already investigating.

680,69,ransomware,Ransomware and the NHS - the inquest begins,15 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39917278,"We now know that Friday's ransomware attack was a global cybercrime, hitting organisations ranging from the Russian Interior Ministry to the delivery firm Fedex.
But the most serious impact was here in the UK on the National Health Service. So what made our hospitals so vulnerable?
There are plenty of theories - among them that far too many computers in hospitals were running Windows XP.
Microsoft stopped supporting this now quite ancient operating system back in 2014, leaving it vulnerable to attacks (although the company took the unusual step over the weekend of rushing out a patch to deal with the Wannacry threat).
The government warned NHS trusts in 2014 that they needed to move away from XP as rapidly as possible.
A letter from the Cabinet Office told them there would be some temporary help with security for old equipment until April 2015, but after that they were on their own.
""It is therefore essential that all NHS organisations put in place robust plans to migrate away from Windows XP, Office 2003 and Exchange 2003 by that date if you have not already done so,"" the letter said.
But did they? At the end of last year the software firm Citrix said that a Freedom of Information request had revealed that 90% of hospitals still had machines running on Windows XP.
Now, while that is extremely worrying, it paints an exaggerated picture. IT professionals in the health service tell me that while many hospitals may have a few computers - or perhaps some key medical equipment - dependent on XP those devices would not usually be connected to the internet.
They believe that the more likely explanation dates back to March this year when Microsoft issued a security update for its more recent versions of Windows. It was designed to deal with a vulnerability in something called Server Message Block, which is a protocol for sharing files across a network.
We now know that Friday's attack made use of this vulnerability, so hospitals which did not apply that patch were leaving themselves open to attack.
So why would they have failed to act? Well, many organisations take time to apply updates, wanting to be sure that there are no compatibility problems with other software applications.
Hospitals often have a wide and somewhat chaotic collection of software, some of which will be very old but still seen as vital by those who use it.
But Dr Joe McDonald, who runs what he describes as a network of geeky doctors and nurses, identifies some other issues.
He explains that since the collapse of the disastrous NHS National Programme for IT there is no longer a centralised approach to things like updates - each trust goes its own way.
He says his area is systematic about keeping systems up to date - but for others, cost is a big issue. ""There is a real squeeze on spending - and IT security isn't seen as sexy compared to things like incubators and kidney machines,"" he says.
The fact that so many Windows XP computers are still allowed in hospitals is a reflection of the low priority given to spending on robust IT.
What we now need to understand is what those NHS organisations which were affected by the ransomware have in common, and how they differ from those which escaped unscathed.
This attack does not appear to have been targeted at hospitals. In fact, security expert Professor Alan Woodward says it may have been an experiment by some relatively inexperienced hackers that took off in a way they didn't expect.
But the NHS will now need to think long and hard about whether it can afford to make cybersecurity such a low priority.",Yes

682,71,ransomware,Apple Mac computers targeted by ransomware and spyware,13 June 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40261693,"Mac users are being warned about new variants of malware that have been created specifically to target Apple computers.
One is ransomware that encrypts data and demands payment before files are released.
The other is spyware that watches what users do and scoops up valuable information.
Experts said they represented a threat because their creators were letting anyone use them for free.
The two programs were uncovered by the security firms Fortinet and AlienVault, which found a portal on the Tor ""dark web"" network that acted as a shopfront for both.
In a blog, Fortinet said the site claimed that the creators behind it were professional software engineers with ""extensive experience"" of creating working code.
Those wishing to use either of the programs had been urged to get in touch and provide details of how they wanted the malware to be set up. The malware's creators had said that payments made by ransomware victims would be split between themselves and their customers.
Researchers at Fortinet contacted the ransomware writers pretending they were interested in using the product and, soon afterwards, were sent a sample of the malware.
Analysis revealed that it used much less sophisticated encryption than the many variants seen targeting Windows machines, said the firm.
However, they added, any files scrambled with the ransomware would be completely lost because it did a very poor job of handling the decryption keys needed to restore data.
""Even if it is far inferior to most current ransomware targeting Windows, it doesn't fail to encrypt victim's files or prevent access to important files, thereby causing real damage,"" wrote the researchers.
The free Macspy spyware, offered via the same site, can log which keys are pressed, take screenshots and tap into a machine's microphone.
In its analysis, AlienVault researcher Peter Ewane said the malicious code in the spyware tried hard to evade many of the standard ways security programs spot and stop such programs.
Mr Ewane said Mac users needed to start being more vigilant as malware creators targeted them.
""As OS X continues to grow in market share we can expect malware authors to invest greater amounts of time in producing malware for this platform.""
Statistics gathered by McAfee suggest that there are now about 450,000 malicious programs aimed at Macs - far fewer than the 23 million targeting Windows users.
Aamir Lakhani from Fortinet said Mac users should make sure their machines were kept up to date with the latest software patches and be wary of messages they receive via email.
""Mac ransomware is definitely becoming bigger,"" he told EWeek. ""Although market share is still small, hackers know that there is valuable data on the Mac.""

A spokesperson for police agency Europol said the situation in Europe ""seems stable"".
In Asia, where many offices closed before the WannaCry ransomware struck on Friday, the attack has been less severe than expected.
The ransomware takes over users' files, demanding $300 (Â£230) to restore them.
The White House said on Monday that under $70,000 (Â£54,000) had been paid in total in a bid to get any locked data released.
Payments could go up as the ransomware warned the cost would double after three days, and threatened to delete files within seven days if no payment was made.
Computer giant Microsoft said the attack, which has affected hundreds of thousands of computers, should serve as a wake-up call.
Among the organisations targeted worldwide have been Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry.
Many firms employed experts over the weekend to try to prevent new infections.
Senior spokesman for Europol, Jan Op Gen Oorth, told the AFP news agency: ""The number of victims appears not to have gone up and so far the situation seems stable in Europe, which is a success.
""It seems that a lot of internet security guys over the weekend did their homework and ran the security software updates.""
UK Health Minister Jeremy Hunt confirmed to the BBC that UK intelligence services had found no evidence of a second wave of attacks on Monday.
The badly affected National Health Service said seven out of 47 trusts that were hit were still facing serious issues.
French carmaker Renault said its plant in the northern town of Douai would not reopen on Monday as it dealt with the cyber-attack.
In Asia, the spread was reportedly slowing, with banking systems largely unaffected:
US President Donald Trump's Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert has also confirmed that no US federal government systems were affected.
This won't take long. Nobody knows. Europol's Jan Op Gen Oorth said: ""A bit early to say... but we are working on a decrypting tool"".
Associated Press quoted Tim Wellsmore, of US security firm FireEye, as saying: ""We expect this is a small operation... They just happened to hit the mother lode.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin said: ""Russia has absolutely nothing to do with it.""
EU Commissioner for Security Julian King told the BBC on Monday that the EU was proposing legislation to reinforce cyber security in the wake of the attack.

Security officials in the UK, however, say they have not seen anything they would regard as hard evidence, Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, reports.
Companies in Asia and Europe have been warning employees to be careful when clicking on attachments and links in their emails.
The message from the UK's National Crime Agency was ""do not pay!"" - there is no guarantee that systems will be restored.
Michael Gazeley, of Network Box, a Hong Kong-based cyber-security firm, told Reuters there were still ""many 'landmines' waiting in people's inboxes"", adding that his firm had detected a new version that infected users directly via a malicious link on hacked websites.
Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, also said it would be easy for the initial attackers or ""copy-cat authors"" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against.
A UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, had predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".
MalwareTech, whose name was revealed in UK media to be 22-year-old Marcus Hutchins, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.
The computing giant says the tool used in this current attack had been developed by the US National Security Agency and was stolen by hackers.
It is highly critical of the way governments store data on software vulnerabilities.
Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said on Sunday: ""We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on Wikileaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world.
""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.""
The organisation also said that many organisations had failed to keep their systems up to date, allowing the virus to spread.
Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it.

685,74,ransomware,Ransomware cyber-attack: Who has been hardest hit?,15 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-39919249,"The WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack has hit more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries since Friday, Europol says.
Governments, hospitals and major companies have all found themselves battling the malware, which demands money in return for unfreezing computers.
The virus tried to infect more computers in Russia than anywhere else, according to an analysis by Kaspersky Lab, a Russian antivirus company.
The interior ministry, railways, banks and the Megafon mobile phone operator - Russia's second-largest - all found themselves battling demands for ransom.
An interior ministry spokeswoman said about 1,000 computers using Microsoft Windows were attacked but these had been isolated from networks.
However, the ministry's vital servers were unaffected because they were running domestic Russian software, the spokeswoman said, including an operating system called Elbrus that was first developed during the late years of the Soviet Union, the New York Times reported.
Electronic boards at stations announcing arrivals and departures were affected, but train services were not disrupted, Deutsche Bahn said.
Many students reported seeing demands for ransoms pop up on their laptops as networks at universities across the country reported severe disruption.
Underfunded universities often use outdated or even pirated computer software, leaving students vulnerable to such attacks, according to BBC Asia-Pacific analyst Celia Hatton.
They are now being forced to pay $300 (Â£230) to continue working on end-of-year projects due to be handed in soon, our correspondent says.
Meanwhile, petrol stations in the western city of Chongqing were unable to accept card payments after systems at China National Petroleum Corp became infected, the South China Morning Post reported.
Overall, hundreds of thousands of computers at nearly 30,000 institutions and organisations were affected, including government agencies and hospitals, internet firm 360 Security said.
The country's biggest cinema chain CJ CGV said some of its advertisement servers connected to 50 cinemas had been affected, Yonhap news agency said.
A company official said films were still being screened as scheduled and the company was investigating.
Overall, nine cases of ransomware had been found, the South Korean government said.
The Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Co-ordination Centre said 2,000 computers at 600 companies in Japan had been affected.
Hitachi said it was experiencing email delays and file delivery failures and suspected the cyber-attack was to blame, although no ransom was being demanded.
The communication and information ministry said the malware locked patient files on computers at two hospitals in the capital Jakarta.
Patients at the Dharmais Cancer Hospital could not get queue numbers and waited several hours while staff found paper records, local media reported.
Police computer systems in the state of Andhra Pradesh have been hit, local media reports say. About 18 systems were hijacked an eventually disabled, the Business Standard reported.
Several companies in the cities of Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai were also affected.
However India has said that its vital computer systems largely escaped unscathed because the state organisation that manages almost all government websites installed patches to immunise its Windows systems.
The Economic Times newspaper had said India could be particularly vulnerable to the malware because a large number of organisations and individuals use old outdated versions of Windows and there are also high numbers of people using pirated software.
Some of the biggest disruption was caused by attacks on the UK health system, which saw hospitals and clinics forced to turn away patients after losing access to computers.
Pictures on social media showed NHS computer screens with messages saying: ""Ooops, your files have been encrypted!""
In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.
A Nissan car factory in the north-eastern city of Sunderland was also affected, a spokeswoman said.
The Spanish telephone operator Telefonica said it had been attacked. Telefonica's head of cyber-security Chema Alonso - himself a former hacker - said the infected equipment was ""under control and being reinstalled"".
Other Spanish firms to be hit included power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural. Staff were reportedly told to turn off their computers.
The car manufacturer had to halt production at many sites, including in France, Slovenia and Romania, as part of measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On Monday the firm said that 90% of its factories were running again. It said its plant at Douai in northern France would be back to normal on Tuesday, following checks. Renault would be able to catch up with any lost production so customers would not be affected, it added.
Three hospitals in Ireland have been affected but the government says it will not name them and patient care is ""broadly unaffected"".
The logistics firm said it was ""implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible"", without specifying how badly it had been affected.
Australian officials said so far only three small-to-medium sized businesses had reported being locked out of their systems.
In New Zealand, the ministry of business said a small number of unconfirmed incidents were being investigated.",Yes
686,75,ransomware,Massive ransomware infection hits computers in 99 countries,13 May 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39901382,"A massive cyber-attack using tools believed to have been stolen from the US National Security Agency (NSA) has struck organisations around the world.
Cyber-security firm Avast said it had seen 75,000 cases of the ransomware - known as WannaCry and variants of that name - around the world.
There are reports of infections in 99 countries, including Russia and China.
Among the worst hit was the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Scotland.
The BBC understands about 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled.
The malware spread quickly on Friday, with medical staff in the UK reportedly seeing computers go down ""one by one"".
NHS staff shared screenshots of the WannaCry program, which demanded a payment of $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files for each computer.
Throughout the day other, mainly European countries, reported infections.
Some reports said Russia had seen more infections than any other single country. Domestic banks, the interior and health ministries, the state-owned Russian railway firm and the second largest mobile phone network were all reported to have been hit.
Russia's interior ministry said 1,000 of its computers had been infected but the virus was swiftly dealt with and no sensitive data was compromised.
In Spain, a number of large firms - including telecoms giant Telefonica, power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural - were also hit, with reports that staff at the firms were told to turn off their computers.
People tweeted photos of affected computers including a local railway ticket machine in Germany and a university computer lab in Italy.
France's car-maker Renault, Portugal Telecom, the US delivery company FedEx and a local authority in Sweden were also affected.
China has not officially commented on any attacks it may have suffered, but comments on social media said a university computer lab had been compromised.

Explaining the global ransomware outbreak
A hack born in the USA?
Coincidentally, finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthiest countries have been meeting in Italy to discuss the threat of cyber-attacks on the global financial system.
They are expected to release a statement later in which they pledge greater co-operation in the fight against cyber-crime, including spotting potential vulnerabilities and assessing security measures.
The infections seem to be deployed via a worm - a program that spreads by itself between computers.
Most other malicious programs rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code.
By contrast, once WannaCry is inside an organisation it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too.
Some experts say the attack may have been built to exploit a weakness in Microsoft systems that had been identified by the NSA and given the name EternalBlue.
The NSA tools were stolen by a group of hackers known as The Shadow Brokers, who made it freely available in April, saying it was a ""protest"" about US President Donald Trump.
At the time, some cyber-security experts said some of the malware was real, but old.
A patch for the vulnerability was released by Microsoft in March, which would have automatically protected those computers with Windows Update enabled.
Microsoft said on Friday it would roll out the update to users of older operating systems ""that no longer receive mainstream support"", such Windows XP (which the NHS still largely uses), Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003.
The number of infections seems to be slowing after a ""kill switch"" appears to have been accidentally triggered by a UK-based cyber-security researcher tweeting as @MalwareTechBlog.
He was quoted as saying he noticed the web address the virus was searching for had not been registered - and when he registered it, the virus appeared to stop spreading.
But he warned this was a temporary fix, and urged computers users to ""patch your systems ASAP"".
Many jobs can be done using software everyone can buy, but some businesses need programs that perform very specific jobs - so they build their own.
For example. a broadcaster might need specialist software to track all the satellite feeds coming into the newsroom, and a hospital might need custom-built tools to analyse X-ray images.
Developing niche but useful software like this can be very expensive - the programming, testing, maintenance and continued development all adds up.
Then along comes a new version of Windows, and the software isn't compatible. Companies then face the cost of upgrading computers and operating system licenses, as well as the cost of rebuilding their software from scratch.
So, some choose to keep running the old version of Windows instead. For some companies, that is not a huge risk. In a hospital, the stakes are higher.",Yes

If the ransom remains unpaid, it continues deleting random files every six hours.
The Stampado malware is for sale for less than $50 for a lifetime's licence.
Unlike other variants, it does not need administrator rights to start infecting computers.
Ransomware is malicious software that scrambles the data on a victim's PC and then asks for payment before restoring the data to its original state.
The costs of unlocking data vary, with individuals typically paying a few hundred pounds and businesses a few thousand.
""Cryptoware is such a big segment of the malware economy, malware creators have to constantly release new products to keep their clients engaged and the money flowing,"" said security firm Heimdal in a blog.
In June, researchers at Intel Security said they had seen an ""alarming"" rise in the volume of ransomware available to hackers.
They said that they had logged 124 separate variants of the malware.
The FBI also said that it had seen ransomware attacks double in the past year, with more than 2,400 complaints. It estimated losses from such attacks stand at $24m (Â£18m) in that timeframe.

689,78,ransomware,Ransomware 'stopped' by new software,12 July 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36772461,"Scientists at the University of Florida (UF) say they have developed software that can stop the growing problem of ransomware in its tracks.
Ransomware encrypts computer files and is used by hackers who then demand money in exchange for freeing the content.
It is becoming a huge problem globally.
The solution - dubbed CryptoDrop - detected the malware and stopped it after it had encrypted just a handful of files, said its developers.
Patrick Traynor, an associate professor in UF's department of computer and information science, worked with PhD student Nolen Scaife and Henry Carter, from Villanova University, on the software.
""Our system is more of an early-warning system,"" Mr Scaife said.
""It doesn't prevent the ransomware from starting... it prevents the ransomware from completing its taskâ¦ so you lose only a couple of pictures or a couple of documents rather than everything that's on your hard drive, and it relieves you of the burden of having to pay the ransom.""
In tests, CryptoDrop had spotted 100% of malware samples and stopped it after an average of 10 files had been encrypted, researchers said.
In May, the FBI issued a warning saying that the number of ransomware attacks had doubled in the past year and was expected to grow even more rapidly this year.
It said that it had received more than 2,400 complaints last year and estimated losses from such attacks at $24m (Â£18m) for individuals and businesses.
Governments, large companies, banks, hospitals and educational institutions are all among the victims of such attacks.
Richard Cassidy, an expert at security firm Alert Logic said of CryptoDrop: ""Whilst the step taken by researchers at the University of Florida are indeed a novel way in which to detect and contain ransomware, it doesn't serve as the 'silver bullet' for ransomware as a whole.""
""There are new variants being written all the time and ransomware writers will indeed take the time to dissect and understand how this new technology operates, creating versions that will attempt to either bypass detection, or at the very least search more effectively for likely sensitive files, before encrypting them, with the hope of having the biggest impact of securing a ransom payment.""
The team at UF currently has a prototype that works with Windows-based systems.
It is seeking a commercial partner for the software, having recently presented its paper on the technology at a conference in Japan.",Yes
690,79,ransomware,US charges three North Koreans over $1.3bn theft,17 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56103921,"Three North Koreans have been charged in the US over a scheme to steal and extort more than $1.3bn (Â£940m) from banks and businesses around the world.
The three, who are not in custody, are also accused of deploying malicious cryptocurrency programs.
A Canadian-American citizen was also charged with money laundering.
The men are also accused of being part of the Wannacry cyber-attack of 2017, which crippled UK health service computer systems on a national scale.
Announcing the charges, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers, said North Korea ""has become a criminal syndicate with a flag"".
One of the defendants, Park Jin Hyok, was previously charged two years ago for his role in the 2014 hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures.
Mr Park, Jon Chang Hyok and Kim Il are accused of criminal conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.
The Department of Justice says the defendants work for the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's military intelligence agency.
""North Korea's operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world's leading bank robbers,"" Mr Demers said.
All three men are believed to be in North Korea, which does not extradite its citizens to face US charges.
The Canadian-American man, 37-year-old Ghaleb Alaumary, from Mississauga, Ontario, is accused of being the group's money launderer in a separate case announced on Wednesday. Officials say he has agreed to plead guilty to the charge
Sony Entertainment Picture's 2014 film, The Interview, is widely believed to have been the initial motive for the attack on the film company.
The satirical film, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, ridicules North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and centres around a fictitious assassination plot against him.
The men are also believed to have had a hand in the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack in 2017.
The attack temporarily crippled UK National Health Service (NHS) computer systems and affected more than 150 countries around the world.
About 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled.
There are broadly three reasons why governments choose cyber-attacks to further their interests: to spy on each-other; to steal intellectual property; or to meddle in politics.
This indictment adds further evidence to the theory that North Korea bucks the trend. The politically isolated country is actually far more interested in making money.
As the assistant attorney general put it, North Korean hackers are ""the world's leading bank robbers"".
Of all the major cyber powers, North Korea has time and time again used its considerable skills to prop up a struggling economy.
It's working rather well, too - with well over $1bn in the bank from these hacks alone.
While other nations cause chaos and political noise with their hackers, North Korea seems content to quietly continue lining its coffers.
The three men hit by the indictment also conducted campaigns targeting US defence and energy contractors. As part of this, Department of State and Pentagon officials were tricked into sharing their credentials so hackers could access their computers.
""The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,"" Acting US Attorney Tracy Wilkison said.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said it fully supported the criminal charges.
""Working with our allies we are committed to countering malicious activity by state and non-state actors and will defend ourselves from disruptive behaviour in cyber-space,"" said the organisation's director for operations, Paul Chichester.",Yes
691,80,ransomware,Ransomware attacks around the world grow by 50%,27 April 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39730407,"Ransomware attacks on businesses around the world rose 50% last year, research into successful cyber-breaches shows.
Its popularity means malware is now responsible for 51% of all the incidents analysed in the annual Verizon data breach report.
This analyses almost 2,000 breaches to find out how firms were caught out by cyber-thieves.
It also found that measures taken by some firms after payment systems were targeted, stopped new breaches.
The rapid rise in the number of successful ransomware attacks was widely expected, said Marc Spitler, senior manager in Verizon's security research division, simply because so many malicious hacking groups were adopting the tactic.
""Ransomware is all about how can they get more money per infected device,"" he said.
A separate report by security firm Symantec found that the average amount paid by victims of ransomware had risen to $1,077 (Â£834).
Consumers were likely to be hit straight away with ransomware, said Mr Spitler, but attacks on businesses were stealthier. Often, he said, attackers burrowed deeper into a company's infrastructure to find key databases that were then scrambled before payment was sought.
In most attacks, booby-trapped attachments sent via email were the main delivery mechanism for ransomware and other malware, found the report.
""These attacks are all about getting a foothold on a system,"" he said, adding that once attackers were inside an organisation they typically looked to use the back doors for many different types of attack.
Darren Thomson, chief technology officer for Symantec in Europe, said its statistics suggest about one in every 131 email messages was now harbouring some kind of cyber-threat.
""They are arriving in Word documents and Excel spreadsheets,"" he said, ""the messages people get many times a day.""
The Verizon report also spotted a shift in the targets of cyber-attacks with 61% of victims now being companies with fewer than 1,000 employees.
The good news, said Mr Spitler, was that some industry sectors that had been hit hard before, now appeared less often in its attack statistics - suggesting their digital defences were starting to work.
""The lack of large retailers suffering point-of-sale intrusions was a glimmer of hope,"" he said.",Yes
692,81,ransomware,'Alarming' rise in ransomware tracked,7 June 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36459022,"Cyber-thieves are adopting ransomware in ""alarming"" numbers, say security researchers.
There are now more than 120 separate families of ransomware, said experts studying the malicious software.
Other researchers have seen a 3,500% increase in the criminal use of net infrastructure that helps run ransomware campaigns.
The rise is driven by the money thieves make with ransomware and the increase in kits that help them snare victims.
Ransomware is malicious software that scrambles the data on a victim's PC and then asks for payment before restoring the data to its original state. The costs of unlocking data vary, with individuals typically paying a few hundred pounds and businesses a few thousand.
""Ransomware and crypto malware are rising at an alarming rate and show no signs of stopping,"" said Raj Samani, European technology head for Intel Security.
Ransomware samples seen by his company had risen by more than a quarter in the first three months of 2016, he added.
Mr Samani blamed the rise on the appearance of freely available source code for ransomware and the debut of online services that let amateurs cash in.
Ransomware was easy to use, low risk and offered a high reward, said Bart Parys, a security researcher who helps to maintain a list of the growing numbers of types of this kind of malware.
""The return on investment is very high,"" he said.
Mr Parys and his colleagues have now logged 124 separate variants of ransomware. Some virulent strains, such as Locky and Cryptolocker, were controlled by individual gangs, he said, but others were being used by people buying the service from an underground market.
""It's safe to say that certain groups are behind several ransomware programs, but not all,"" he said. ""Especially now with Eda and HiddenTear copy and paste ransomware, there are many new, and often unexperienced, cybercriminals.""
A separate indicator of the growth of ransomware came from the amount of net infrastructure that gangs behind the malware had been seen using.
The numbers of web domains used to host the information and payment systems had grown 35-fold, said Infoblox in its annual report which monitors these chunks of the net's infrastructure.
""They use it and customise it for each attack, "" said Rod Rasmussen, vice-president of security at Infoblox.
""They will have their own command and control infrastructure and they might use it to generate domains for a campaign,"" he told the BBC. ""Then they'll have some kind of payment area that victims can go to.""
""The different parts are tied to particular parts of the chain,"" he said. ""Infection, exploitation and ransom.""
The spread of ransomware was also being aided by tricks cyber-thieves used to avoid being detected by security software, said Tomer Weingarten, founder of security company SentinelOne.
""Traditional anti-virus software is not effective in dealing with these types of attacks,"" he said.
The gangs behind the most prevalent ransomware campaigns had got very good at hiding their malicious code, said Mr Weingarten.
""Where we see the innovation is in the infection vector,"" he said.
SentinelOne had seen gangs using both well-known techniques and novel technical tricks to catch out victims.
A lot of ransomware reached victims via spear-phishing campaigns or booby-trapped adverts, he said, but other gangs used specialised ""crypters"" and ""packers"" that made files look benign.
Others relied on inserting malware into working memory so it never reached the parts of a computer on which most security software keeps an eye.
""It's been pretty insane with ransomware recently,"" he said.",Yes
693,82,ransomware,UK cyber-threat agency confronts Covid-19 attacks,3 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54782258,"More than a quarter of the incidents which the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) responded to were Covid-related, according to its latest annual report.
The review covers the period from September 2019 to August 2020, so the pandemic occupied an even higher proportion of the agency's efforts after the first lockdown began.
In total there were 723 incidents of all kinds, marking close to a 10% rise on the previous period.
Of those, 194 were Covid-related.
Some of the incidents related to countering nation-state attacks, but most were criminal in nature, the GCHQ division reported.
It also disclosed that it had thwarted 15,354 campaigns that had used coronavirus themes as a ""lure"" to fool people into clicking on a link or opening an attachment containing malicious software.
Some involved fake shops selling PPE (personal protective equipment), test kits and even vaccines.
Protecting the NHS and health-related research has been a priority, the report said..
In July, the UK accused Russia of trying to steal vaccine-related information through cyber-espionage.
And officials said they had continued to see an ""ongoing threat"" of states targeting the vaccine research-and-delivery programme.
The NCSC said it had scanned more than one million NHS IP (internet protocol) addresses to look for vulnerabilities, and had shared 51,000 indicators of compromise.
It has also carried out ""threat hunting"" to look for security risks on connected devices, and worked on the security of the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app.
The NCSC also warned ransomware attacks had become more common.
Ransomware locks people out of their computers and demands victims make a blackmail payment to restore access - and even then it is not always granted.
The NCSC said it had handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents as in the previous year.
These included an attack against Redcar and Cleveland Council which, the officials said, had ""caused considerable damage and disruption"".
The report added the NCSC had observed a growing trend for such attacks to be more targeted and aggressive than previously.
Rather than just locking people out of access to their data until a ransom was paid, attackers often warned they would embarrass victims if they refused to comply.
""We have seen the threat of data being leaked,"" Paul Chichester, director of operations, told the BBC.
Examples included details of staff salaries being published online.
This meant victims were at risk even if they have backed up their data.
However, the NCSC said the UK did not appear to be as heavily targeted as some countries, because British victims were less likely to pay the attackers.
The NCSC has also been working to increase skills and diversity in the cyber-security industry.
It said almost 12,000 girls had taken part in its 2020 competition. However, an advert for the government's related CyberFirst campaign was widely criticised last month for featuring a ballerina and the slogan ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber"".
The report also highlighted the agency's role in protecting parliament as it became ""virtual"" to prevent hacking of debates or votes.
And it revealed that the NCSC had just updated the system for producing cryptographic keys, which encrypt classified government and military systems.

694,83,ransomware,WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack 'may have N Korea link',16 May 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39931635,"Who was behind the huge global cyber-attack? One prominent theory right now is North Korea - but what we know is far from conclusive.
You may not have heard of the Lazarus Group, but you may be aware of its work. The devastating hack on Sony Pictures in 2014, and another on a Bangladeshi bank in 2016, have both been attributed to the highly sophisticated group.
It is widely believed that the Lazarus Group worked out of China, but on behalf of the North Koreans.
Security experts are now cautiously linking the Lazarus Group to this latest attack after a discovery by Google security researcher Neel Mehta. He found similarities between code found within WannaCry - the software used in the hack - and other tools believed to have been created by the Lazarus Group in the past.
It's a mere sliver of evidence, but there are other clues to consider too.
Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert, pointed out to me that the text demanding the ransom uses what reads like machine-translated English, with a Chinese segment apparently written by a native speaker.
""As you can see it's pretty thin and all circumstantial,"" Prof Woodward said.
""However, it's worth further investigation.""
""Neel Mehtaâs discovery is the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCry,â said Russian security firm Kaspersky, but noted a lot more information is needed about earlier versions of WannaCry before any firm conclusion can be reached.
""We believe itâs important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of WannaCry,â the company added.
""Looking back to the Bangladesh attack, in the early days, there were very few facts linking them to the Lazarus Group.
""In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together with high confidence. Further research can be crucial to connecting the dots.""
Attributing cyber-attacks can be notoriously difficult - often relying on consensus rather than confirmation.
For example, North Korea has never admitted any involvement in the Sony Pictures hack - and while security researchers, and the US government, have confidence in the theory, neither can rule out the possibility of a false flag.
Skilled hackers may have simply made it look like it had origins in North Korea by using similar techniques.
'Wouldnât stand up in court'
In the case of WannaCry, it is possible that hackers simply copied code from earlier attacks by the Lazarus Group.
But Kaspersky said false flags within WannaCry were ""possible"" but ""improbable"", as the shared code was removed from later versions.
""There's a lot of ifs in there,"" added Prof Woodward.
""It wouldn't stand up in court as it is. But it's worth looking deeper, being conscious of confirmation bias now that North Korea has been identified as a possibility.""
Itâs the strongest theory yet as to the origin of WannaCry, but there are also details that arguably point away from it being the work of North Korea.
First, China was among the countries worst hit, and not accidentally - the hackers made sure there was a version of the ransom note written in Chinese. It seems unlikely North Korea would want to antagonise its strongest ally. Russia too was badly affected.
Second, North Korean cyber-attacks have typically been far more targeted, often with a political goal in mind.
In the case of Sony Pictures, hackers sought to prevent the release of The Interview, a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. WannaCry, in contrast, was wildly indiscriminate - it would infect anything and everything it could.
Finally, if the plan was simply to make money, itâs been pretty unsuccessful on that front too - only around $60,000 (Â£46,500) has been paid in ransoms, according to analysis of Bitcoin accounts being used by the criminals.
With more than 200,000 machines infected, it's a terrible return. But then of course, maybe the ransom was a distraction for some other political goal not yet clear.
Another possibility is that the Lazarus Group worked alone, without instruction from North Korea. Indeed, it could be that the Lazarus Group isnât even linked to North Korea.
More questions than answers - and in cyber-war, facts are extremely hard to come by.",Yes

In a statement, the National Cyber Security Centre said a ransomware attack of this type and on this scale could happen again although there is ""no specific evidence"" as yet.
It said it knew of attempts to attack organisations other than the NHS, and warned more cases could ""come to light"" in the UK and elsewhere as the new working week begins.
Ransomware attacks are ""some of the most immediately damaging forms of cyber-attack"", it said, and advised companies to:

The ransomware, which locked users' files and demanded payment to allow access, spread to 150 countries, including Russia, the US and China.
In England, 47 trusts reported problems at hospitals, GP surgeries or pharmacies and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.
Some hospitals were forced to cancel treatment and appointments and, unable to use computers, many doctors resorted to using pen and paper.
The cost of the attack is unknown, in the UK or beyond, but BBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggest hackers have already been paid the equivalent of Â£22,080.
The Scottish government said the cyber-attack had been isolated and it expected that most NHS computers would be back to normal by Monday. NHS England has told patients to attend hospital if they have an appointment unless they are told not to.
However, several trusts in England have issued their own advice to patients. As of Sunday night they were:
The government is insisting that the NHS had been repeatedly warned about the cyber-threat to their IT systems.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Â£50m of Â£1.9bn set aside for UK cyber-protection was being spent on NHS cyber systems to improve their security.
But Labour say the Conservatives have cut funding to the NHS's IT budget and specifically a contract to protect computer systems was not renewed after 2015.
The Liberal Democrats and Labour have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack.
In an interview on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Sir Michael said NHS trusts had been encouraged to ""reduce their exposure to the weakest system, the Windows XP"", with fewer than 5% of trusts using it now.
""We want them to use modern systems that are better protected. We warned them, and they were warned again in the spring. They were warned again of the threats,"" he added.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to ask why concerns repeatedly flagged up about the NHS's ""outdated, unsupported and vulnerable"" machines had not been addressed.
On ITV's Robert Peston, Mr Ashworth accused the government of having ""cut the IT and infrastructure budget"" by Â£1bn in the NHS, and said his party, if elected to power, would put Â£10bn into the infrastructure of the NHS.
He called for the Conservatives to publish the Department of Health's risk register to see how seriously they were taking IT threats.
Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said more than 120 public bodies were being contacted to ensure their defences were adequate.
Kingsley Manning, a former chairman of NHS Digital - which provides the health service's IT systems - told the BBC on Saturday that several hundred thousand computers were still running on Windows XP.
And a neurology registrar from London, Dr Krishna Chinthapalli, wrote an article for the British Medical Journal just a week ago, warning that hospitals would ""almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year"".
He told the BBC the NHS was in a tricky position - treating sick patients, as a 24/7 operation with specialist software - making update implementation complicated.
""People developing ransomware know a hospital is a good target because the information is about patients and is time-sensitive - hospitals need to get their data back quicker,"" he said.
Attacks on hospital data and patients were ""despicable at the basic level"", he said.
Meanwhile, digital rights campaigners Open Rights Group has accused GCHQ of a ""very dangerous strategy of hoarding knowledge of security problems"".
It said Britain's electronic surveillance agency was ""in charge of hacking us and protecting us from hackers"", making it hard to balance the risks of keeping vulnerabilities secret.
Jim Killock, the group's executive director, said: ""US and UK security agencies kept a widespread vulnerability secret rather than telling the companies so they could fix it."" He called for the National Cyber Security Centre to be made independent from GCHQ.
It's unlikely. Europol head Rob Wainwright said he was concerned that the number affected would continue to rise when people returned to work on Monday morning.
He told the BBC there was an escalating threat from the virus, known as Wanna Decryptor or WannaCry, adding: ""We've never seen anything like this - it's unprecedented in scale.""

696,85,ransomware,Petya ransomware encryption system cracked,11 April 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36014810,"Petya ransomware victims can now unlock infected computers without paying.
An unidentified programmer has produced a tool that exploits shortfalls in the way the malware encrypts a file that allows Windows to start up.
In notes put on code-sharing site Github, he said he had produced the key generator to help his father-in-law unlock his Petya-encrypted computer.
The malware, which started circulating in large numbers in March, demands a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (Â£265).
It hid itself in documents attached to emails purporting to come from people looking for work.
Security researcher Lawrence Abrams, from the Bleeping Computer news site, said the key generator could unlock a Petya-encrypted computer in seven seconds.
But the key generator requires victims to extract some information from specific memory locations on the infected drive.
And Mr Abrams said: ""Unfortunately, for many victims extracting this data is not an easy task.""
This would probably involve removing the drive and then connecting it up to another virus-free computer running Windows, he said.
Another tool can then extract the data, which can be used on the website set up to help people unlock their computer.
Independent security analyst Graham Cluley said there had been other occasions when ransomware makers had ""bungled"" their encryption system.
Cryptolocker, Linux.encoder and one other ransomware variant were all rendered harmless when their scrambling schemes were reverse-engineered.
""Of course,"" said Mr Cluley, ""the best thing is to have safety secured backups rather than relying upon ransomware criminals goofing up.""",Yes
697,86,ransomware,Global cyber-attack: Security blogger halts ransomware 'by accident',13 May 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39907049,"A UK security researcher has told the BBC how he ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious ransomware that has affected hundreds of organisations, including the UK's NHS.
The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, had taken a week off work, but decided to investigate the ransomware after hearing about the global cyber-attack.
He managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code.
""It was actually partly accidental,"" he told the BBC, after spending the night investigating. ""I have not slept a wink.""
Although his discovery did not repair the damage done by the ransomware, it did stop it spreading to new computers, and he has been hailed an ""accidental hero"".
""I would say that's correct,"" he told the BBC.
Cyber-attack scale 'unprecedented'
NHS 'robust' after cyber-attack
""The attention has been slightly overwhelming. The boss gave me another week off to make up for this train-wreck of a vacation.""
The researcher first noticed that the malware was trying to contact a specific web address every time it infected a new computer.
But the web address it was trying to contact - a long jumble of letters - had not been registered.
MalwareTech decided to register it, and bought it for $10.69 (Â£8).  Owning it would let him see where computers were accessing it from, and give him an idea of how widespread the ransomware was.
By doing so, he unexpectedly triggered part of the ransomware's code that told it to stop spreading.
Analysis: How did it start?
What is the ransomware?
This type of code is known as a ""kill switch"", which some attackers use to halt the spread of their software if things get out of hand.
He tested his discovery and was delighted when he managed to trigger the ransomware on demand.
""Now you probably can't picture a grown man jumping around with the excitement of having just been 'ransomwared', but this was me,"" he said in a blog post.
MalwareTech now thinks the code was originally designed to thwart researchers trying to investigate the ransomware, but it backfired by letting them remotely disable it.
While the registration of the web address appears to have stopped one strain of the ransomware spreading from device-to-device, it does not repair computers that are already infected.
Security experts have also warned that new variants of the malware that ignore the ""kill switch"" will appear.
""This variant shouldn't be spreading any further, however there'll almost certainly be copycats,"" said security researcher Troy Hunt in a blog post.
MalwareTech warned: ""We have stopped this one, but there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us.
""There's a lot of money in this, there is no reason for them to stop. It's not much effort for them to change the code and start over.""",Yes
698,87,ransomware,NHS cyber-attack: GPs and hospitals hit by ransomware,13 May 2017,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39899646,"NHS services across England and Scotland have been hit by a large-scale cyber-attack that has disrupted hospital and GP appointments.
The prime minister said the incident was part of an untargeted wider attack affecting organisations globally.
Some hospitals and GPs have been unable to access patient data, after their computers were locked by a ransomware program demanding a payment worth Â£230.
But there is no evidence patient data has been compromised, NHS Digital said.
The BBC understands about 40 NHS organisations and some GP practices have been hit. The NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland has not been affected.
There is no indication of who is behind the attack yet, but the hackers demanded their payment in the virtual currency Bitcoin, which is harder to trace.
Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""This is not targeted at the NHS, it's an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected.""
Mrs May added that the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was ""working closely"" with the NHS ""to ensure that they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety"".
Ambulances have been diverted from hospitals in some areas and there has been disruption at some GP surgeries as a result of the attack.
NHS England said patients in an emergency should go to A&E or access emergency services as they normally would.
Dr Anne Rainsberry, NHS incident director, added: ""More widely, we ask people to use the NHS wisely while we deal with this major incident, which is still ongoing.""
A massive ransomware campaign appears to have attacked a number of organisations around the world, with reports of infections in more than 70 countries.
Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms company which owns mobile network O2, said it had detected a ""cybersecurity incident"" but that clients and services had not been affected.
Screenshots of a program that locks computers and demands a payment in Bitcoin have been shared online by those affected.
NHS Digital said the attack was believed to have been carried out by the malware variant Wanna Decryptor.
""Our focus is on supporting organisations to manage the incident swiftly and decisively, but we will continue to communicate with NHS colleagues and will share more information as it becomes available,"" it said.
There could be a lot of reasons why the NHS was hit so hard by this attack.
The most likely one is because it is a huge organisation supported by a massive IT infrastructure.
It also has lots of partners and suppliers that connect to its core network.
Complexity is the enemy of security and it is a fair bet that some bits of that network, especially those operated by suppliers, are not as well maintained as they should be.
This could mean that patches that would have thwarted WannaCry were not applied.
So, as soon as the worm got in, it could run rampant.
Dr Chris Mimnagh, who works at a medical centre in Liverpool, said the attack had made its job impossible.
""Our entire patient record is accessed through the computer - blood results, history, medicines.
""Most of our prescribing is done electronically... it's sent direct to the pharmacy and... all that is not able to be accessed when we lose the clinical system.""
Dr Emma Fardon, a GP in Dundee, said she had returned from house visits to find a message on the surgery's computers asking for money.
""We can't access any patient records. Everything is fully computerised,"" she said.
""We have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have. We can't access the appointments system.""
Dr Afzal Ashraf, an expert on cyber-security who has previously worked as an adviser to the government, told the BBC it was likely that the malware was spreading when NHS services shared documents and information.
But he also said he thought it was unlikely the attackers had deliberately targeted the NHS.
He added: ""I think they probably attacked a small company assuming they would get a small amount of money but it's got into the NHS system and now they have the full power of the state against them - because obviously the government cannot afford for this sort of thing to happen and be successful.""

700,89,ransomware,Warning over 'nasty' ransomware strain,29 March 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35916425,"The FBI is seeking help from US firms as it investigates a nasty strain of ransomware, Reuters reports.
Ransomware encrypts data on infected machines and then asks for money before restoring access to information.
The FBI is analysing a strain of ransomware called MSIL/Samas that tries to encrypt data across entire networks rather than single computers.
The plea comes as security firms warn about other novel strains of the fast-growing, data-scrambling cyber-threats.
The FBI sent out the request for help after discovering that the group behind MSIL/Samas had stepped up its efforts to find victims.
In the confidential advisory obtained by Reuters, the FBI said the group used a publicly available security program called Jexboss to scan networks looking for vulnerable versions of the widely used JBoss software.
When a vulnerable system is found, the malware launches an attack that seeks to scramble data on servers. It also finds and deletes the back-up files firms could use to restore data scrambled by ransomware.
Cisco said it had seen a ""widespread campaign"" using Samas targeting firms involved in healthcare. Early versions of the malware charged a ransom of one bitcoin (Â£300) for every machine hit but later versions upped this to 1.5 bitcoins.
""It is likely the malware author is trying to see how much people will pay for their files,"" wrote Cisco security analyst Nick Biasini in an advisory. ""They even added an option for bulk decryption of 22 bitcoin (Â£6,600) to decrypt all infected systems.""
The FBI's request for aid comes as security firms warn about recently created ransomware variants that use different methods to lock up systems and force victims to pay.
The Petya malware targets a key Windows system file called the Master Boot Record that helps a PC get started. By overwriting this file, people are prevented from getting at any data on their PC unless they pay up.
Trend Micro said it had seen Petya distributed in email messages crafted to look like they are from someone looking for work. The CV attached to the message is a booby-trapped program that launches Petya, said Trend security engineer Jasen Sumalapao in a blogpost. Petya charges a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (Â£265) to unlock infected machines.
Security firm Carbon Black has found another novel strain that goes after many firms that use Windows PowerShell - a scripting program widely used to administer machines running Windows.
Dubbed PowerWare, this strain hides malicious code in Word documents and calls on PowerShell to execute the attack code when the booby-trapped files are opened.
""Deceptively simple in code, 'PowerWare' is a novel approach to ransomware, reflecting a growing trend of malware authors thinking outside the box in delivering ransomware,"" said Rico Valdez from Carbon Black.",Yes

Ransomware is a type of computer malware that scrambles data and demands a fee for it to be restored.
Citizens have been told they must visit government offices to do tasks usually completed online or by phone.
The county commissioner told local media that he was taking advice from cybersecurity experts and the FBI.
Licking County, which is in Ohio, has about 170,000 residents.
The local government says it has about 1,000 computers and 12 servers, which have been taken offline making many government websites inaccessible.
Many of the county's public services, including the emergency services, have resorted to working in ""manual mode"" without their computers, to prevent the malware being spread to more devices.
Residents are still able to call 911 in an emergency but the process may take longer than usual.
""It's slower than we'd like,"" Sean Grady, director of the Licking County Emergency Management Agency, told the Newark Advocate.
""It takes us back 25 years in how we dispatch. We ask more detailed questions.""
County commissioner Tim Bubb said the malware was a ""crime against the people of Licking County"" but added that the government had not been specifically targeted.
""Clearly, it's designed to make money for somebody. It was just our unlucky day,"" he said.
Some variants of ransomware have previously been defeated, with removal instructions now available online.
However, security experts warn that in some cases the only way to get data back is by restoring from a back-up.
Mr Bubb said he was exploring that option, but did not know how long it would take for computer systems to be back online.
""We're evaluating our back-ups. We think our back-ups are pretty darn good,"" he said.",Yes

Four separate security firms have spotted attacks they believe emanated from China in recent months, reveals Reuters.
There is speculation that the ""skilled operators"" could be state-sponsored hackers.
The Chinese government said it would investigate if there was reliable proof.
Dell SecureWorks investigated two ransomware attacks this year - one at a transportation company and one at a technology firm
In the second case, 30% of the unnamed firm's machines were captured by the hackers.
Phil Burdette, who heads an incident response team at Dell said: ""It is obviously a group of skilled operators that have some amount of experience conducting intrusions.""
Security firms Attack Research, InGuardians and G-C Partners said they had investigated three other similar attacks since December.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters that it would not act on ""rumours and speculation"" but the ministry itself said that if there was reliable proof, it would treat the matter seriously.
The Chinese government pledged to oppose economic espionage in an agreement with the US last year, with some US firms since reporting a drop in the amount of hacking sourced from China.
It also wants deeper internet security co-operation with the US as hacking continues to be a sore spot in US-China relations.
If the government has reduced its support for economic espionage, that may mean hackers are looking for other means of supplementing their incomes, reports Reuters.
Recently security firms warned about a huge surge in junk mail messages containing ransomware, which was blamed on new malware hitting the market which can avoid being spotted by anti-virus software.
Ransomware has been around for years but better encryption techniques mean it is often impossible for victims to regain access to their files without co-operation from the hackers.

703,92,ransomware,"Tech Tent - ransomware, election bots and AI",21 October 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37728786,"On this week's Tech Tent - your weekly status update on the technology business - we have three stories reflecting our current anxieties about the nature of our digital world.
We'll discuss the biggest cybersecurity threat of the moment, the use of bots in the fight to get the upper hand on social media during the US elections and the ongoing debate about the risks of artificial intelligence.
This week, producer Jat Gill and I attended a demo by security firm Sophos which left us both rather scared. James Lyne from the firm played a bad guy launching an attack on a company, while two colleagues played the increasingly confused system administrators trying to work out what was going on as chaos engulfed the network.
We then heard that the principle weapon in the attackers' armoury was now ransomware. This is malicious software that first takes over your network, then encrypts all your files before demanding a ransom - usually in Bitcoin - to unlock them.
This is now proving a major threat to organisations from hospitals to police forces - we don't know the exact scale of the problem because it seems many quietly pay up without telling anybody.
What's really scary is that some of this ransomware is now out there on the internet but without any way of even paying the criminals behind it, who have long since moved on. That means there is no way of unlocking your encrypted files.
So what's to be done? James Lyne tells us that companies which regularly update their security systems should be safe - but the most important advice is to make regular back-ups of your files, and make sure they are insulated from the rest of your network.
Computational propaganda is the term  Professor Philip Howard of Oxford University  uses to describe his research project. He is on this week's show talking about his study of Twitter activity during the Presidential debates.
His research - which has not yet been peer reviewed - appears to show that many more automated accounts are being used to tweet in support of Donald Trump than the bots backing Hillary Clinton.
During British election campaigns I get bombarded with reports from sentiment analysis firms, claiming they can mine Twitter to understand who is winning over voters. Those claims always seemed dubious - even more so, now that it appears that expertise in running bots is becoming the prime weapon in social media campaigning.
At a period  when new advances in Artificial Intelligence seem to be reported every day, the ethical issues surrounding its impact on our lives are rising up the agenda.
This week saw the opening of an AI think tank,  the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, in Cambridge with Prof Stephen Hawking renewing his warnings that the technology could bring extraordinary benefits to mankind - but could also spell the end for us.
Then on Thursday night I took part in a Cambridge Union debate opposing the motion: ""This House fears the rise of artificial intelligence"". I'm afraid to report that our side lost - and fear won - though all the speakers agreed we needed a more nuanced view of AI.
And that's what we get on Friday's programme from one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence research in the UK, Prof Margaret Boden. She tells us to stop worrying about some apocalypse that is a very remote danger but start thinking about the ethics of using robots to care for the elderly.

The University of Calgary transferred 20,000 Canadian dollars-worth of bitcoins ($15,780; Â£10,840) after it was unable to unwind damage caused by a type of attack known as ransomware.
The malware caused emails and other files to become encrypted.
One expert warned that the payout would encourage further blackmail attempts.
The move comes the same week Intel warned that ransomware infections were spreading at ""an alarming rate"".
More than 120 separate strains exist, many of which are frequently updated, making it difficult for security experts to offer a solution.
The University of Calgary told a local newspaper that more than 100 of its computers had been affected since it was attacked last month.
""The university is now in the process of assessing and evaluating the decryption keys,"" said the university's vice president Linda Dalgetty.
""The actual process of decryption is time-consuming and must be performed with care.
""It is important to note that decryption keys do not automatically restore all systems or guarantee the recovery of all data.""
She added that the local police force was investigating the matter.
The university follows other high-profile bodies to have met cybercriminals' demands in recent weeks.
In February, the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid $17,000 to restore access to its system.
At the end of the same month, Melrose Police Department in Massachusetts paid $450 after it fell victim to a similar attack.
""It's very tempting for organisations to pay out the ransom because that might be the only way they can get their data back, but that makes it worse for everyone else because it encourages more people to set up schemes like the one used in the Calgary case,"" commented Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London.
""It would be better if nobody ever paid, although that's unrealistic to expect.
""What's making matters worse is a new trend.

707,96,ransomware,Cyber threat to disrupt start of university term,17 September 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54182398,"Universities and colleges are being warned by the UK's cyber-security agency that rising numbers of cyber-attacks are threatening to disrupt the start of term.
The National Cyber Security Centre has issued an alert after a recent spike in attacks on educational institutions.
These have been ""ransomware"" incidents which block access to computer systems.
Paul Chichester, the NCSC's director of operations, says such attacks are ""reprehensible"".
The return to school, college and university, already facing problems with Covid-19, now faces an increased risk from cyber-attacks, which the security agency says could ""de-rail their preparations for the new term"".
The cyber-security body, part of the GCHQ intelligence agency, says attacks can have a ""devastating impact"" and take weeks or months to put right.
Newcastle University and Northumbria have both been targeted by cyber-attacks this month, and a group of further education colleges in Yorkshire and a higher education college in Lancashire faced attacks last month.
The warning from the NCSC follows a spate of ransomware attacks against academic institutions - in which malicious software or ""malware"" is used to lock out users from their own computer systems, paralysing online services, websites and phone networks.
The security agency says this is often followed by a ransom note demanding payment for the recovery of this frozen or stolen data - sometimes with the added threat of publicly releasing sensitive information.
Universities have frequently been targets of cyber-attacks - with up to a thousand attacks per year in the UK.
Attacks can be attempts to obtain valuable research information that is commercially and politically sensitive. Universities also hold much personal data about students, staff and, in some cases, former students who might have made donations.
Earlier this summer more than 20 universities and charities in the UK, US and Canada were caught up in a ransomware cyber-attack involving a cloud computing supplier, Blackbaud.
A Freedom of Information inquiry in July, carried out by the TopLine Comms digital public relations company, found 35 UK universities, out of 105 responses, had faced ransomware attacks over the past decade. There were 25 which had not had attacks - and a further 43 which declined to answer.
One university reported 42 separate ransomware attacks since 2013.
The warning from the NCSC highlights the vulnerability of online systems for remote working, as increased numbers of staff are working from home.
""Phishing"" attacks, where people are tricked into clicking on a malicious link such as in an email, also remains a common pathway for such ransomware attempts, says the advice.
Mr Chichester of the NCSC says: ""The criminal targeting of the education sector, particularly at such a challenging time, is utterly reprehensible.""
""I would strongly urge all academic institutions to take heed of our alert.""
Universities UK says data security has had to become a priority for higher education - and that ""protections are in place to manage threats as much as possible"".
The universities body also says it is working with the NCSC to produce ""robust guidance on cyber-security"" which will be released later this academic year.",Yes

Live reports: Ransomware cyber-attack fallout
Should you pay the WannaCry ransom?
Many firms have had experts working over the weekend to prevent new infections. The virus took control of users' files and demanded $300 (Â£230) payments to restore access.
The spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief, experts have said. More than 200,000 computers have been affected so far.

BBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggests about $38,000 (Â£29,400) had been paid by Monday morning.
However, the ransomware warning said that the cost would double after three days, so the payments may increase. It threatens to delete files within seven days if no payment is made.
The effect in Asian nations so far on Monday has been limited. South Korea said just nine cases of ransomware had been found, giving no further details.
Australian officials said so far only three small-to-medium sized businesses had reported being locked out of their systems while New Zealand's ministry of business said a small number of unconfirmed incidents were being investigated.
In Japan, both Nissan and Hitachi reported some units had been affected, while in China energy giant PetroChina said that at some petrol stations customers had been unable to use its payment system.
A statement from Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems.
""We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world,"" he wrote.
""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.""
He added: ""The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.""
The organisation also said that many organisations had failed to keep their systems up to date, allowing the virus to spread.
Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it.
""As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems,"" Mr Smith said.
There are going to be some tough questions on Monday for those institutions which didn't do enough to keep their networks secure, as well as the organisations that were best placed to stop it happening in the first place - the NSA and Microsoft.
The NSA keeps a chest of cyberweapons to itself so it can hit targets, but Microsoft has long argued that this is dangerous. If there is a flaw in Windows, the company said, surely the safest thing to do is to let its team know straight away so it can be fixed.
But then Microsoft also needs to consider what obligation it has to update all users - not just the ones who pay extra for security on older systems.
Updating your computer if you're an individual is a piece of cake, but for a network the size of Britain's National Health Service? Tough - time-consuming, expensive and complex.
For a company like Microsoft to say it won't keep those systems safe unless they shell out more money, then that in itself is something of a ransom.
Meanwhile Europol's chief told the BBC the ransomware was designed to allow ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"", adding: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time.""
Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the virus, he said.
A UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".
MalwareTech, whose name was revealed in UK media to be 22-year-old Marcus Hutchins, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.
Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or ""copy-cat authors"" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against.
""Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday, we should expect it soon afterwards,"" she said.
In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.
Other organisations targeted worldwide included Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's Interior Ministry.

709,98,ransomware,Ransomware advice service to tackle extortion gangs,25 July 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36883056,"European police agency Europol is teaming up with cybersecurity companies in an initiative aimed at slowing an ""exponential"" rise in ransomware.
The scheme revolves around a website that connects victims and police, gives advice and helps with data recovery.
The number of ransomware victims tripled in the first three months of 2016, according to one estimate.
Ransomware is malware that typically demands a fee to unscramble important data on a compromised device.
The No More Ransom site will be updated as ransomware gangs are tackled, one of the project's partners said.
Co-ordinated by Europol, the initiative also involves the Dutch national police, Intel Security and Kaspersky Labs.
""For a few years now ransomware has become a dominant concern for EU law enforcement,"" said Wil van Gemert, Europol's deputy director of operations.
""We expect to help many people to recover control over their files, while raising awareness and educating the population on how to maintain their devices clean from malware.""
No More Ransom brings together information about what ransomware is, how to avoid falling victim and what to do if a person or company is caught out.
""Right now the only option victims have is to pay the ransom or not,"" said Raj Samani, European head of Intel Security. ""This gives people another option.""
Often, people struggle to find out what they can do when they are hit.
With this website, victims will be able to upload scrambled files to identify which strain of ransomware has locked up their data, he said.
""We've seen a threefold increase in infected victims from January to March this year,"" he added. ""And we're seeing a rise in new families of ransomware coming up all the time.""
In June, one site that tracks ransomware logged more than 120 separate families of the malicious code being used in different campaigns.
""It's becoming a hugely profitable economy for the criminals,"" said Mr Samani. ""They know there's real money to be made here.
""What's particularly telling is that historically ransomware victims have been consumers and small businesses,"" he said. ""But we are now seeing bigger institutions, hospitals and universities, getting hit.""
The site will be kept up to date with information gleaned from international action against gangs that run ransomware campaigns, Mr Samani said.
Other police forces, security companies and researchers will be encouraged to contribute to the site and add advice or tools to help victims.
At present, the site links to decryption software for four well-known families of ransomware - Coinvault, Shade, Rannoh and Rakhni.",Yes
710,99,ransomware,Three US hospitals hit by ransomware,23 March 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35880610,"The IT systems of three US hospitals have been infected with ransomware, which encrypts vital files and demands money to unlock them.
The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again.
None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom.
And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI.
The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system.
A message on its homepage said: ""Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services.
""We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications.""
It later said no patient data or care had been affected.
Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: ""It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems.
""However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online.""
The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware.
In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back.
Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky.
The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros ""if the data encoding is incorrect"".
Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked.
In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016.
Security expert Brian Krebs said: ""It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted.
""I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.""",Yes
711,100,ransomware,Spike in ransomware spam prompts warnings,10 March 2016,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35773058,"Security firms are warning about a sudden ""huge"" surge in junk mail messages containing ransomware.
The surge is being blamed on the group behind a novel strain of ransomware called Locky.
One security firm reported that a version of Locky produced two weeks ago is now the second most prevalent form of ransomware it sees.
The US, France and Japan were the top targets for the gang behind Locky, statistics suggested.
Like many other ransomware programs, Locky encrypts data on an infected machine and then asks for a payment before providing a decryption key. Currently Locky asks for 3 bitcoins (Â£885) as payment.
The first versions of Locky hid the malicious attachment that did the encrypting in add-ons or macros for Microsoft Word. Now, say security firms, its creators have switched to using attachments written in Javascript.
""We are currently seeing extraordinary (sic) huge volumes of Javascript attachments being spammed out,"" said Rodel Mendrez, a security expert at Trustwave in a blogpost.
The switch to Javascript has helped Locky avoid being spotted by anti-virus software, said Trustwave.
At peak spamming times, wrote Mr Mendrez, about 200,000 messages an hour carrying ransomware attachments were hitting its junk mail spotting servers.
Security firm Fortinet said it had caught almost 19 million copies of ransomware emails over the last two weeks. The latest version of Locky using the Javascript attachment accounted for 16.5% of this total, said Roland Dela Paz in a blogpost.
The most prevalent ransomware family in that total was Cryptowall which was found in 83.5% of the ransomware emails it had caught. Cryptowall first appeared in early 2014.
The spam surge had helped establish Locky as a ""significant presence"" in the ransomware world, said Mr Dela Paz.
The attackers sending out large amounts of Locky spam were using the same network of hijacked computers, known as a botnet, that was used to distribute the Dridex banking trojan.
""It's the same botnet, different day, and different payload,"" said Mr Mendrez.
To avoid falling victim, people and companies should regularly back up data so it can be restored if a machine gets infected, he said.",Yes
712,1,encryption,Priti Patel: Facebook encryption plan âmust not hamper child protectionâ,19 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56795852,"Facebook's plans to roll out encryption across its messaging services could jeopardise ongoing work to combat child abuse, the Home Secretary has warned.
Such encryption means only the sender and recipient can read messages.
""We cannot allow a situation where law enforcement's ability to tackle abhorrent criminal acts and protect victims is severely hampered,"" Priti Patel told a charity-hosted event.
Facebook says its plans for wider encryption protects users' privacy.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), which invited Ms Patel to speak, has claimed that private messaging ""is the frontline of child sexual abuse"".
Encrypting messages by default could lead to the easier spread of child abuse imagery or online grooming, it has said.
In her speech, the Home Secretary said that Facebook must take into account public safety when it makes changes to its platform - and in particular seriously consider the effect on children.
""Sadly, at a time when we need to be taking more action... Facebook is still pursuing end-to-end encryption plans that place the good work and the progress that has already been made at jeopardy,"" she said.
""Offending is continuing, and will continue - these images of children being abused just continue to proliferate, even right now while we are speaking. But the company intends to blind itself to this problem through end-to-end encryption which prevents all access to messaging content.""
""My view is that this is simply not acceptable,"" she added.
Facebook, however, said that ""end-to-end encryption is already the leading security technology used by many services to keep people safe from hackers and criminals"". Safety features are already a part of its plans, it added.
End-to-end encryption guarantees privacy by making sure only the sender or recipient can read the messages.
While it travels, it is scrambled to be unreadable, including by law enforcement. The only way to read the message is usually to get physical access to an unlocked device receiving it.
Currently, only one of Facebook's major messaging platforms - WhatsApp - uses end-to-end encryption by default. The company has plans to make the privacy feature the norm on Facebook Messenger and Instagram - but has not yet done so.
When messaging platforms are not end-to-end encrypted, tech giants such as Facebook can use automatic scanning of their users' posts to identify the sharing of known child abuse images and detect questionable use of private messaging - such as an older person chatting to underage users they do not already know.
The NSPCC argues that rolling out the encryption as planned would ""render these [scanning] tools useless"", and is calling on Facebook to reconsider. An estimate from the US National Center for Missing and Exploited children suggests as many as 70% of child abuse reports around the world could be lost if it goes ahead.
The NPSCC unveiled research at the event that suggests social media users are keen to see some guarantee that children's safety will be protected.
The charity is demanding a ""reset"" of the debate, arguing that it has become stuck as an ""either/or"" debate between personal privacy and child safety.
Instead, it is calling for a ""balanced"" solution that protects both.
Ms Patel echoed that sentiment, saying: ""I want to make it clear that the government does support encryption, where of course companies can protect users' privacy, and there are many areas where this is important.""
""We believe that it is possible to implement end-to-end encryption, the service, in a way in which is also consistent with public protection and child safety,"" she said.
But she did not say what that would look like. Some possible solutions, such as on-device software that scans messages before they are sent, have their own privacy concerns.
Gaining access to the content of encrypted messages has long been a topic of debate in government.
One of Ms Patel's predecessors, Amber Rudd, argued in the wake of the 2017 Westminster attack that ""we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into... encrypted WhatsApp"".
And former Prime Minister David Cameron, in the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks, declared that there should be no ""means of communication"" which ""we cannot read"".
Despite such concerns, encrypted messaging remains a sensitive topic with much public support.
Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: ""Encryption is popular and growing because users want security and protection from fraud, scams and abuse of their data.""
""It would be completely unreasonable to ban or limit everyday security for one set of people over the other.
""It is absolutely necessary to deal with child abuse images, but solutions must be compatible with people's right to keep themselves safe from other kinds of criminality, so should move away from endlessly debating how to stop the use of encryption.""
But Sir Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, argued that view risked ""leaving children unprotected where there is most harm"".
""It's in firms' interests to find a fix that allows them to continue to use tech to disrupt abuse in an end-to-end encrypted world,"" he added.
And he said that if the tech giants failed to do so, ""ultimately government must be the guardrail"" to protect children.
Facebook has long defended its plans to introduce end-to-end encryption as essential to user privacy.
In a statement reacting to the Home Secretary's remarks, a company spokesman said: ""Child exploitation has no place on our platforms and Facebook will continue to lead the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect and respond to abuse.
""Its full rollout on our messaging services is a long-term project and we are building strong safety measures into our plans.""",Yes
713,2,encryption,Boris Johnson's personal mobile phone number available online for 15 years,16 hours ago,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-56937889,"Boris Johnson's personal mobile phone number has been freely available on the internet for the past 15 years, it has been revealed.
It was published in a think tank press release in 2006, but never deleted - and appears to be the one the PM uses.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a serious situation [that] carries a security risk"".
But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that, as far as he was aware, ""all security protocols have been followed"".
It appears the number has been switched off but Downing Street still has not confirmed if the number will now be changed.
Questions have been raised in recent weeks over who has access to ministers' personal phone numbers, amid a wider row about lobbying and influence.
The PM had reportedly been advised by senior officials to change his number, but this has been denied by Downing Street last week.
Sir Keir said: ""A lot of people will be concerned, not just about who has got the number but who has been using it.
""What has come out in recent weeks is [about] privileged access - those who can WhatsApp the prime minister for favours - and this all is further evidence that there is one rule for them and another rule for everybody else.""
The Labour leader also said he had changed his number when he became director of public prosecutions in 2008, adding: ""I have kept it secure since then.""
But Mr Sunak said what made the PM ""special"" was that he was ""incredibly approachable"".
He added: ""You see it whenever he is out and about - people feel they can relate to him, they can talk to him, they can tell him what's on their mind.""
Mr Sunak also revealed he had not changed his own personal phone number since becoming chancellor last February.
The think tank press release with the PM's number on it was related to Mr Johnson's then-job as a shadow higher education minister - and MP for Henley - and invited journalists to contact him for further comment.
Two years later, he successfully stood to become mayor of London.
Former national security adviser Lord Ricketts warned hostile states with ""sophisticated cyber capabilities"" or criminal gangs could now have access to Mr Johnson's digits.
The crossbench peer also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he would have thought changing your mobile number when becoming PM would be an ""elementary security precaution these days"".
But earlier this week, the UK's top civil servant, Simon Case, told MPs that officials ""put security packages around all the communications that ministers have by whatever means"".
He added: ""The level of encryption and standards of security on everybody's mobile phone increasing all the time.""
Labour MP Rachel Hopkins said the incident had implications for security, lobbying and the risk of blackmail.
But Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins said the PM was ""aware of his responsibilities"" on national security.
She told the BBC that she had ""complete and utter confidence"" that Mr Johnson and his advisors knew what needed to be done for him to fulfil those ""duties"".
It was revealed earlier this month that the prime minister had contacted businessman Sir James Dyson at the start of the pandemic.
In an exchange of text messages, Mr Johnson promised to ""fix"" a tax issue for Sir James, whose company planned to work on building ventilators during the pandemic.
The PM said he had done the ""right thing"" in ""shifting heaven and earth and doing everything I possibly could"" to help increase supply.
In responding to the urgent call for help at the start of the pandemic, Sir James also wanted to be clear about complying with rules and protecting the business from any extra costs or liabilities.
But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was wrong that people ""who've got the prime minister's number can access him and ask about tax breaks"".
The Daily Telegraph recently reported the UK's most senior civil servant, Simon Case, had suggested Mr Johnson change his number because it was too widely known.
And the Times reported last week that a Universal Credit claimant once contacted the PM directly ""asking for help with their benefit claim"" after they were passed his number by a friend.

714,3,encryption,Signal: Cellebrite claimed to have 'cracked' chat app's encryption,22 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55412230,"Israeli security firm Cellebrite has claimed that it can decrypt messages from Signal's highly secure chat and voice-call app, boasting that it could disrupt communications from ""gang members, drug dealers and even protesters"".
A blog on its website detailing how it did it has since been altered.
According to one cyber-security expert, the claims sounded ""believable"".
But others, including Signal's founder, have dismissed them as being risible.
The BBC has contacted Cellebrite and Signal for comment.
Signal did not reply but later posted a blog describing Cellebrite's original post as being ""pretty embarrassing"".
Highly encrypted apps such as Signal and Telegram have become popular among people keen to keep their messages private. The adoption rates have worried law enforcement agencies, who feel they are hampering their ability to investigate crimes.
""Apps like these make parsing data for forensic analysis extremely difficult,"" writes Cellebrite.
The firm has a series of products, including the UFED (Universal Foresenic Extraction Device) - a system that allows authorities to unlock and access the data on suspects' phones.
Cellebrite provided a technical explanation of how it found a decryption key that allowed it to access the messages that Signal stores its database. It then described how it searched Signal's open-source code for clues as to how to breach the database.
""We finally found what we were looking for,"" it writes, with a full explanation of how it did it, which has since been deleted.
Its claim suggested that it could ""crack"" Signal's encryption on Android phones to decrypt messages and attachments, but did not mention Apple devices.
In response to people questioning Cellebrite's claims, the creator of Signal - Moxie Marlinspike - dismissed the idea that the app had been compromised.
""This was an article about 'advanced techniques' Cellebrite used to decode a Signal message on an unlocked Android device,"" he tweeted.
""They could have also just opened the app to look at the messages.
""The whole article read like amateur hour, which is I assume why they removed it.""
John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog based at the University of Toronto, moved to reassure users that Signal ""remains one of the most secure and private ways to communicate"".
""If they are worried about their chats being extracted from a confiscated device, they can enable disappearing messages,"" he added.
Signal, owned by the Signal Technology Foundation, puts privacy at the heart of its system, using a system that  had been thought almost impossible to break.
The messaging app is endorsed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, who claims to use it ""every day"".
On its website, it says that it uses state-of-the-art, end-to-end encryption to keep all conversations secure.
""We can't read your messages or listen to your calls, and no-one else can either.""
Alan Woodward, a professor of computer science at Surrey University, said Signal was ""one of the most secure, if not the most secure, messenger service publicly available"".
""Signal employs end-to-end encryption, but goes further than apps like WhatsApp by obscuring metadata - who talked to who when and for how long,"" he explained.
""Cellebrite seem to have been able to recover the decryption key, which seems extraordinary as they are usually very well protected on modern mobile devices.""
He added that if this was indeed true, it was no surprise Cellebrite would have altered its blog.
""I suspect someone in authority told them to, or they realised they may have provided enough detail to allow others - who don't just supply to law-enforcement agencies - to achieve the same result.""",Yes
715,4,encryption,Signal slams Cellebrite security company over alleged security holes,22 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56846357,"Encrypted-messaging app Signal says it has found flaws in software used by cyber-security company Cellebrite.
The two companies have been at odds since Cellebrite claimed to have cracked Signal's secure messaging last year - a claim it fiercely disputed.
In the latest spat, Signal boss Moxie Marlinspike joked he had acquired Cellebrite's system after it ""fell off a truck"" in front of him.
And, he claimed, its software was so flawed he could easily hack into it.
""There are virtually no limits on the code that can be executed,"" he blogged, suggesting the flaws could be used to access data, change settings, and more.
In a statement, Cellebrite said: ""We constantly strive to ensure that our products and software meet and exceed the highest standards in the industry so that all data produced with our tools is validated and forensically sound.""
Mr Marlinspike said: ""By a truly unbelievable coincidence, I was recently out for a walk when I saw a small package fall off a truck ahead of me.
""Inside, we found the latest versions of the Cellebrite software, a hardware dongle designed to prevent piracy... and a bizarrely large number of cable adapters.""
Hinting at his motives for the blog post, he said: ""Their software is often associated with bypassing security, so let's take some time to examine the security of their own software.""
And in a video loaded with satirical references to the 1995 cult film Hackers, Mr Marlinspike then demonstrated apparently running a simple piece of code on a machine running Cellebrite  software, which he claimed showed an easy way to compromise the security company's system.
""It's possible to execute any code,"" he added, ""and a real exploit payload would likely seek to undetectably alter previous reports, compromise the integrity of future reports (perhaps at random), or exfiltrate data from the Cellebrite machine.""
They say revenge is a dish best served cold - but in this case, it was served with a giggle.
Signal's blog post is full of hacking references and pointed jibes at Cellebrite.
The flaws Signal claims to have discovered in the controversial Cellebrite technology, if accurate, are embarrassing for a company billing itself as smart enough to crack into secure-messaging systems.
And this comes, of course, only months after Cellebrite claimed to have developed a way to crack private Signal messages - a claim since debunked.
So this cyber-security revenge research seems to have left Cellebrite with questions to answer.
Cyber-security expert Andrew Morris summed up this story best when he tweeted: ""This blog post is the nerd equivalent of an absolutely ruthless rap diss track.""
And this hacking rap battle may already have ended with a Signal mic drop.
The row began in December, when Cellebrite claimed to have cracked Signal's encryption system, in a blog post it later altered to downplay the claim.
Signal responded by calling the claim ""pretty embarrassing"" and criticising media coverage - particularly that of BBC News.
In his most recent post., Mr Marlinspike said: ""One way to think about Cellebrite's products is that if someone is physically holding your unlocked device in their hands, they could open whatever apps they would like and take screenshots of everything in them to save and go over later,""
""Cellebrite essentially automates that process for someone holding your device in their hands.""
In its own statement, Cellebrite said it ""understands that research is the cornerstone of ensuring this validation, making sure that lawfully obtained digital evidence is utilised to pursue justice"".
""We will continue to integrate these standards in our products, software, and the Cellebrite team, in order to deliver the most effective, secure and user-friendly tools for our customers,"" it added.",Yes

717,6,encryption,Facebook shareholders try to block encryption plan,27 May 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52779897,"Investors at Facebook's annual stockholder meeting will vote on a proposal to postpone the firm's plans for end-to-end encryption.
The firm says it wants to make the measure the default option across its messaging platforms to protect privacy.
But activist shareholders say this would make it nearly impossible to detect child exploitation on Facebook.
The group wants the company to delay the move until after its board of directors studies the risk further.
""As shareholders, we know that privacy is important to a social media company, but it should not come at the expense of unleashing a whole new torrent of virtually undetectable child sexual abuse on Facebook,"" said Michael Passoff, founder of Proxy Impact, a shareholder advocacy service supporting the measure.
Facebook's 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held virtually due to Covid-19, but investors will still be able to vote on measures and hear about the management plans.
Facebook claims to be a leader in fighting child exploitation on the internet.
""As we expand end-to-end encryption to secure people's private messages from hackers and criminals we remain committed to leading our industry in keeping children safe,"" it said.
The measure is unlikely to pass.
Most of the company's voting shares are controlled by Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small number of other executives.
In March 2019, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted the firm to make end-to-end encryption the base level of security for all its messaging services - including Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging. But he did not lay out a timeline, and many engineers thought it would be several years before it happened.
The initiative would mean that messages - including text and imagery - are digitally scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can make sense of them, and not Facebook itself.
WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, already has this level of security.
The US, UK and Australian governments have been among those pressuring Facebook to create a backdoor or other workaround that would give them access to  messages to help in criminal investigations. The company has so far refused to do this.
The measure put forward by Proxy Impact would force Facebook to examine whether something could be done to mitigate ""the risk of increased sexual exploitation of children"" as a consequence.
In 2019, tech companies reported close to 70 million videos and pictures of children being sexually exploited to authorities. Nearly 85% of those reports came from Facebook.
According to Mr Passoff, if the firm were to go through with its encryption plans, 70% of the cases it reports would become invisible to the firm.
For Facebook, this is a matter of balancing privacy and public security.
Users have expressed anger in the past at Facebook's use and protection of their personal data. End-to-end encryption should prevent criminals from gaining access to private conversations and help protect personal and financial data, assuming users' devices are not compromised.
It would also offer the firm a defence against being responsible for detecting and reporting criminal and terrorist activity, as it would no longer be able to read the messages involved.
Some investors supporting the measure claim this could prove damaging to the company.
""Numerous controversies have eroded its reputational capital and put the company at risk for future competitive threats,"" said Lisette Cooper, vice-chair of Fiduciary Trust International, which is supporting the vote.
""The position of Facebook as the world's number one hub for online child sexual abuse material is not the marketing strategy you want to have for long-term success.""
However, Mr Zuckerberg has previously addressed the issue directly.
""When we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,"" he said in October.
But he added that he was ""optimistic"" that predators could still be identified by other means, including their patterns of activity.",Yes
718,7,encryption,The ransomware surge ruining lives,14 hours ago,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56933733,"A global coalition of technology companies and law enforcement bodies is calling for ""aggressive and urgent"" action against ransomware.
Microsoft, Amazon, the FBI and the UK's National Crime Agency have joined the Ransomware Task Force (RTF) in giving governments nearly 50 recommendations.
Ransomware gangs are now routinely targeting schools and hospitals.
Hackers use malicious software to scramble and steal an organisation's computer data.
The RTF has submitted its report to President Biden's administration.
It argues that ""more than just money is at stake"" and says that, in just a few years, ""ransomware has become a serious national security threat and public health and safety concern"".
RTF co-chair Jen Ellis, from cyber-security company Rapid 7, says: ""Citizens are being impacted by this every day. It's having a huge impact on the economy and the ability for ordinary people to access critical services.
""Not only that but, really distressingly, the funds that come in from paid ransoms fund other forms of organised crime, like human trafficking and child exploitation.""
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, also a member of the Ransomware Task Force says it handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents in 2020 than in the previous year.
""It was a Sunday morning in October last year when I got a call about problems with our IT systems,"" says Rob Miller, director of information and communications technology for the London Borough of Hackney.
""It quickly became apparent that it was a serious cyber-attack.
""We had to lock everything down and switch off the internet for all of our systems. We have services running 24/7 for nearly 300,000 residents, and it felt huge and really worrying.
""We knew that there was a huge challenge ahead of us, and the whole council had to pull together across all departments to get key services back up and running as quickly as possible.
""The damage done was really significant with things like housing repairs, benefits payments and land registry all impacted.
""It's going to be months until we're fully recovered, and I can't understand the motivation behind this for the criminals.
""You sit there and look at the impact on local communities especially in a time of a pandemic.
""I can't imagine anyone who would think it is OK to cause that much damage to services at a time like that. It's hard to comprehend.""
The secrecy and stigma associated with ransomware attacks makes it extremely difficult to calculate a true picture of the number of attacks and costs.
The FBI says that nearly 2,400 US companies, local governments, healthcare facilities and schools were victims of ransomware in the last year.
RTF researchers confirmed hundreds of major attacks took place around the world last year, including in the UK, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, India, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
Cyber-security company Emsisoft estimates that the true global cost of ransomware, including business interruption and ransom payments in 2020, was a minimum of $42bn (Â£30bn) and a maximum of nearly $170bn.
A survey by Veritas Technologies found that 66% of victims admitted to paying part or all of the ransom.
The RTF is recommending that governments make it mandatory for victims to report if they do pay criminals.
""I couldn't believe it when we were hacked,"" says Martin Kelterborn, chief executive of Offix Group in Aarburg, Switzerland, which was attacked in May 2019.
""I went into my IT department and the manager was pale and clearly shocked. He told me everything had gone. We watched live as all our product pictures for our websites were encrypted one after the other.
""I had 230 employees coming to me asking what to do. We had tens of thousands of orders, but no computer systems to sort through them.
""At one point me and my boss actually wrote a press release declaring that the company was dead and out of business. They were the worst three weeks of my life.
""The hackers were the Ryuk ransomware gang and they demanded we pay them 45 Bitcoin, which was about half a million dollars.
""Yes we did consider paying, but in the end they actually destroyed so much of our system that we needed to rebuild anyway. Recovering has cost us about the same: half a million dollars.""
The RTF's other recommendations to governments include:
For years cyber-security organisations have alleged that ransomware gangs are operating openly in North Korea, Iran and Russia.
Earlier this month, the US government sanctioned multiple Russian entities saying that the Kremlin ""cultivates and co-opts criminal hackers, including the previously designated Evil Corp, enabling them to engage in disruptive ransomware attacks"".
Last week it was reported that the US Department of Justice had formed an internal team to deal with the increased threat of ransomware.",Yes
719,8,encryption,NSPCC urges Facebook to stop encryption plans,6 February 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51391301,"Child-protection organisations say Facebook's decision to strongly encrypt messages will give offenders a place to hide.
The company is moving ahead with plans to implement the measure on Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct.
But more than 100 organisations, led by the NSPCC, have signed an open letter warning the plans will undermine efforts to catch abusers.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said she ""fully supported"" the move.
In a statement to the BBC, she said: ""Tech companies like Facebook have a vital responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of vulnerable children.""
""Following my letter to Mark Zuckerberg, I met with Sheryl Sandberg and emphasised that Facebook's encryption plans cannot be allowed to hamper their ability to protect young people from paedophiles online. We have also submitted detailed evidence to the US Senate about these concerns.
""I fully support the continued efforts of the NSPCC and children's charities around the world to engage Facebook on this issue.""
End-to-end encryption, already used on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, means no-one, including the company that owns the platform, can see the content of sent messages.
Those signing the letter say Facebook has failed to address concerns about child safety.
The missive urges the company to stop the rollout of its plans until ""sufficient safeguards"" are in place.
""At a time when we could be looking to build upon years of sophisticated initiatives, Facebook instead seems inclined to blindfold itself,"" the letter says.
""We urge you to recognise and accept that an increased risk of child abuse being facilitated on or by Facebook is not a reasonable trade-off to make.
""Children should not be put in harm's way either as a result of commercial decisions or design choices.""
Among the other signatories were Barnardo's, 5Rights, the International Centre For Missing and Exploited Children, and Child USA.
A spokesman for Facebook said protecting the wellbeing of children on its platform was ""critically important"" to it.
""We have led the industry in safeguarding children from exploitation and we are bringing this same commitment and leadership to our work on encryption,"" he said.
""We are working closely with child-safety experts, including NCMEC [the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children], law enforcement, governments and other technology companies, to help keep children safe online.""
In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the NCMEC.
The National Crime Agency said this had led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe.
But, the NCMEC estimates, if Facebook implements end-to-end encryption, it could mean 70% of these vital reports are lost.
In October, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said the increased risk of child abuse ""weighed heavily"" on him when considering the company's end-to-end encryption plan.
A BBC News investigation last year found encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a place to host criminals.
But WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart has previously posted on Hacker News: ""End-to-end encryption protects that right for over a billion people every day.""
And Jo O'Reilly, digital privacy advocate at ProPrivacy, said many users would probably welcome Facebook's plans.
""It will make it significantly less likely that hackers will be able to intercept messages, going a long way to protect users from phishing and cyber-stalking,"" she said.
""It is the kind of of decisive action users will be looking for to reassure them that their private conversations really are private in the wake of privacy scandals.""
But Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, said end-to-end encryption would make catching criminals tougher.
""If Facebook proceed with their current plans, they will knowingly put the safety of children at risk - ignoring the warnings of police, charities and experts across the world,"" he said.
""There is a moral responsibility on them to ensure this does not happen.""
And NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Facebook may be happy to shut their eyes to abuse but they can't close their ears to this unanimous concern shown by international experts.
""In its current form, encryption would breach Facebook's duty of care for children so the UK government must ensure a new regulator has the power to hold them financially and criminally accountable.",Yes
720,9,encryption,FBI 'persuaded Apple to halt iCloud encryption',23 January 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51207744,"Apple reportedly abandoned plans to let customers fully encrypt back-ups of their iPhones on the company's iCloud following pressure from the FBI.
Full encryption involves converting data into code so it is impossible to access without a password.
Apple was working on the feature in secret about two years ago, according to Reuters, which broke the news.
But some suggest an alternative explanation is concern about users getting locked out of their accounts.
At present, Apple can help a subscriber get back data created on a lost, damaged or stolen device, even if they have forgotten their account's credentials, since the company holds a copy of their iCloud encryption key.
""If Apple were to implement end-to-end encryption for iCloud back-ups, there's no might about it - if the customer forgets their password, they would lose access to their data,"" wrote the blogger John Gruber.
He noted that chief executive Tim Cook had given a similar explanation to Der Spiegel in October 2018, when he had indicated that he believed his firm would ""change this practice"" at some point in the future when data-recovery would be controlled solely via users' devices.
Reuters spoke to six sources, including former employees at Apple and the FBI.
It said one ex-Apple worker had suggested the firm's legal department had ultimately ""killed"" the plan.
""That person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption,"" the news agency added.
Reuters reporter Joseph Menn added that he ""could not determine why exactly Apple"" decided to abandon the encryption project.
""Encrypting data is essential and companies usually offer help and support when protecting data, so this news comes as a shock to me,"" commented Jake Moore, a cyber-security expert at internet security and antivirus company ESET.
""However, it doesn't mean your back-up and data can't be encrypted.
""You will still be able to make an encrypted back-up on your home computer and store it there.
""As always, users should also be reminded that their data needs to be protected with a strong and complex password.
""The balance between law enforcement and tech companies protecting data comes into question quite often.
""However, this balance is extremely difficult to fine-tune.
""Typically, users want the easiest route if they care about their data security, so encryption should be handed to them on a plate.""
Over the past seven years, Apple has responded to over 127,000 requests from US law enforcement agencies for information.
Last week, the US Attorney General publicly requested Apple unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida, last month.
And on 14 January, President Donald Trump accused Apple on Twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by ""killers, drug dealers, and other violent criminal elements"".
But Apple did in fact turn over the gunman's iCloud backups.
""We reject the characterisation that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation,"" Apple said on 13 January.
""Our responses to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough and are ongoing.""",Yes
721,10,encryption,Child abuse: Warning of siblings being groomed online,24 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-56337505,"Criminals and paedophiles are trying to groom and exploit young siblings as part of an emerging trend of online sexual abuse, experts have warned.
The Internet Watch Foundation said victims ranged from 3-16 years, with some groomed to copy adult pornography.
It found 511 examples involving siblings between September and December - roughly one in 30 instances of all ""self-generated content"" in that time.
Campaigners say livestreaming services need to do more to protect children.
The IWF, which works with police and websites worldwide to take down harmful material, said the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""perfect storm"" for the abuse.
Its chief executive, Susie Hargreaves, said there had been:
There was a ""common myth"" abuse involving siblings was limited to poorer countries - but most of the videos the IWF found featured children in the West, including from the UK, US and across Europe.
Grooming often begins on social-media and gaming platforms, before offenders encourage children on to video-chat or livestreaming services where the abuse then escalates.
And abuse of siblings typically involves an older child being coerced into abusing their younger brother or sister.
One video, shared online multiple times, involved a brother and sister aged six and three being given instructions by an abuser, the IWF said.
Last December, the government set out its proposed Online Harms Bill, designed to ensure companies provide improved safeguarding measures.
It plans to give watchdog Ofcom the power to:
The proposals contained the ""strongest protections"" for children, Safeguarding Minister Victoria Atkins told BBC News.
""Encouraging siblings to enact sexual abuse demonstrates just how heinous offenders are in this space,"" she added.
NSPCC online-safety-policy head Andy Burrows said it could be a ""world-leading piece of legislation"" but must follow through with its promise to give Ofcom ""teeth"" to step in and take action.
In the past year, in the race to bring video-chat and livestreaming services to market, some technology companies had prioritised profit over making their platforms safe, the charity said.
And Mr Burrows raised particular concerns over Facebook's plans to introduce end-to-end encryption - a way of sending information so only the intended receiver can read it - across all of its messenger services.
Plans to include it in its video-chat service, Rooms, launched in May, would ""significantly compromise the ability to detect child abuse"", he said.
The National Crime Agency said the changes would ""dramatically reduce [Facebook's] ability to provide law-enforcement with the evidence they need"" to prosecute alleged offenders.
Facebook said end-to-end encryption ""was already the leading security technology used by many services to keep people safe"" and ""a long-term project"".
It added: ""We are committed to building strong anti-abuse measures into our plans.
""Facebook will continue to lead the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect and respond to abuse.""

722,11,encryption,Tool checks phone numbers from Facebook data breach,6 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56650387,"People can now enter their phone numbers into a website to see if they appeared in a recent Facebook data breach.
Details of more than 530 million people were leaked in a database online, largely consisting of mobile numbers.
People can use the  Have I Been Pwned online tool to check if their numbers or emails were compromised.
Facebook says the data is from an âoldâ breach in 2019 but privacy watchdogs are now investigating.
Facebook said it had ""found and fixed"" the breach more than a year-and-a-half ago.
But the information has now been published for free in a hacking forum, making it widely available.
The database covers 533 million people in 106 countries, according to researchers analysing the data. That includes 11 million Facebook users in the UK, 30 million Americans and 7 million Australians.
Not every piece of data is available for each user but 500 million phone numbers were leaked compared with âonly a few million email addressesâ, Troy Hunt, a security expert who runs HaveIBeenPwned said in a blog on his website.
Mr Hunt launched the phone number search function after âunprecedented trafficâ to the website, following the news of the Facebook data leak.
Previously, users of the platform could only search for email addresses.
Visitors to the website can now enter their mobile number into a search box, and the website will confirm if it has appeared in the leaked database.
âI wanted to ensure Have I Been Pwned could answer that question for everyone, not just a tiny slice of people,â Mr Hunt told the BBC.
It has also been suggested that Facebookâs own chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had his mobile number leaked in the database.
""This is the number associated with his account from the recent Facebook leak,"" security expert Dave Walker tweeted, along with a screenshot of Zuckerberg's leaked phone number.
The screenshot also suggests Mr Zuckerberg was on messaging platform Signal - which uses end-to-end encryption and is not owned by Facebook.
Facebook has requested users input their phone numbers since 2011, citing security reasons.
It allows for âtwo-factor authenticationâ, an additional feature that sends a text to a userâs mobile whenever somebody logs into their account.
The tech giant has advised users to check what details they share publicly on the platform by updating the How People Find and Contact You section, as well as completing ""regular privacy checkups"".
Facebook added the data was ""scraped"" using public information available on the system, rather than hacked.
Meanwhile, several investigations have been launched into Facebook by privacy watchdogs around the world.
Ireland's Data Protection Commission said it was working with the tech firm to establish if âthe dataset referred to is indeed the same as that reported in 2019â.
The Philippinesâ National Privacy Commission and Hong Kongâs Office of the Privacy Commissioner have also launched probes into the breach.",Yes
723,12,encryption,Cyber-attack hackers threaten to share US police informant data,27 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56898711,"Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department has said its computer network has been breached in a targeted cyber-attack, US media report.
A ransomware group called Babuk is reportedly threatening to release sensitive data on police informants if it is not contacted within three days.
The FBI is investigating the extent of the breach, US media reported, citing the Washington DC police department.
Ransomware is used to scramble computer networks and steal information.
Attackers target companies or organisations and can lock their systems, then demand large sums of money in return for ending the hack.
On Monday, Washington DC's police department said in a statement that it was ""aware of unauthorised access on our server"", AP news agency reported.
""While we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter,"" the statement added, without providing further details of the reported breach.
It is not clear if attackers managed to lock police out of their systems during the breach.
Babuk, a Russian-speaking ransomware group that emerged earlier this year, said it had downloaded ""a sufficient amount of information"" from the police department's internal networks, AP reports.
Screenshots said to have been posted by the group on the dark web and shared on social media appeared to suggest it had gained access to information on criminal gang activity and police intelligence reports.
The head of UK-based cyber-security consultancy Bridewell Consulting, James Smith, said a risk remained for companies and organisations even if a ransom was paid.
""With these types of attacks, the data has probably been stolen already, before it was encrypted, and the likelihood that the data will be sold or stored by the hacker is great,"" he said in a statement to the BBC.
Earlier this month, Babuk reportedly targeted the Houston Rockets basketball team with ransomware and claimed to have accessed documents including player contracts and financial data.
A spokeswoman for the Houston Rockets, Tracey Hughes, said that while the group had accessed some information, it failed to install its ransomware because of a security system in place.
Last week, a Russian man in the US pleaded guilty to plotting to extort money from the electric car company Tesla. He planned to use ransomware to steal company secrets for extortion, prosecutors said.

724,13,encryption,"Facebook encryption threatens public safety, say ministers",4 October 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49919464,"UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and counterparts in the US and Australia have sent an open letter to Facebook calling on it to rethink its plans to encrypt all messages on its platforms.
The policy threatens ""lives and the safety of our children"", they said.
They said it could hamper international efforts to grant law enforcers faster access to private messages on social media, as agreed between the UK and US.
Facebook said ""people have the right to have a private conversation online.""
The head of Facebook-owned WhatsApp Will Cathcart had previously posted on Hacker News: ""End-to-end encryption protects that right for over a billion people every day.""
Facebook said it is ""consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies and devoting new teams and sophisticated technology"" to keep people safe.
The letter was signed by Ms Patel, the US Attorney General William P Barr, Acting US Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and the Australian minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton. It comes off the back of a data access agreement between the US and the UK  designed to remove the barriers to cross-border surveillance.
It allows British law-enforcement agencies to demand from US tech firms data relating to terrorists, child-sexual abusers and other serious criminals.
It is hoped it will dramatically speed up investigations - previously, the process of requesting data from US firms could take anything from six months to two years.
Under the new agreement that could be cut to a matter of weeks or even days.
But there is one major problem - messages sent over services using end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, will remain unreadable.
Following scandals over the misuse of personal data, the social network has focused on privacy and it now offers encryption as an option to users on its Messenger service.
It also has plans to introduce it to Instagram.
""Tech companies like Facebook have a responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of the public,"" the letter read.
It added: ""So far nothing we have seen from Facebook reassures me that their plans for end-to-end encryption will not act as barrier to the identification and pursuit of criminals operating on their platforms.
""Companies cannot operate with impunity where lives and the safety of our children is at stake, and if Mr Zuckerberg really has a credible plan to protect Facebook's more than two billion users, it's time he let us know what it is.""
In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which the National Crime Agency estimates have led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe.
Head of online child safety at the NSPCC Tony Stower said: ""It's an absolute scandal that Facebook are actively choosing to provide offenders with a way to hide in the shadows on their platform, seamlessly able to target, groom and abuse children completely undetected.
""The landmark agreement between the US and UK on accessing data will radically reduce the time it takes for police to get hold of the data they need from tech giants to bring offenders to justice.
""It should be a hugely important step forward in tackling online child abuse - if tech giants play their part too.""
There has been some confusion about whether the Cloud Act could force firms such as Facebook to offer so-called back doors to law enforcement.
In a series of tweets on the issue, Facebook's ex-technology officer Alex Stamos attempted to clarify.
""This agreement would allow UK courts to issue requests equivalent to US courts, but it does not grant them access to anything a US court can't get already,"" he wrote.
""Orders for wire taps of products like WhatsApp can get some data, like IP addresses, phone numbers, contact lists and avatar photos. It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments.""

725,14,encryption,Amphetamine lab found in raid near Redditch,27 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-56901616,"A drugs laboratory capable of producing Â£10m of amphetamine a month has been uncovered during a police raid.
The ""large-scale"" operation was found in outbuildings on Ullenhall Lane near Redditch, Worcestershire.
The investigation began after text messages were obtained by French police during the penetration of the encrypted phone network Encrochat last year.
Vats and sacks of ingredients were found in the lab, which is currently too hazardous for police to enter.
Five people have been arrested in the joint operation between the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Warwickshire Police on Tuesday.
Firefighters and a chemicals expert were drafted in to assist with the raid.
Footage of the inside of the building has been sent to scientific experts for analysis.
Peter Stevens, branch commander at the NCA, said conducting the raid on the ""semi-rural"" site had taken weeks of meticulous planning.
""The laboratory will make illicit amphetamine, it is a class B drug, and will be sold on the market for approximately Â£2,000 per kilo, wholesale price,"" he said.
""It involves a number of different chemicals, all very volatile and dangerous chemicals, as well as some quite specific and sophisticated scientific apparatus and equipment.
""It takes someone with a very good knowledge of those chemicals and the processes required to produce the amphetamine, which is why it is rare for us to encounter it as it needs a crime group that is able to access the chemicals, able to access the equipment and then have someone that can essentially cook the chemicals.
""Once it is cooked, they can then distribute it to other crime groups in the UK, as this crime group has done.""
Assistant Chief Constable Alex Franklin Smith, from Warwickshire Police, said he is confident the operation will have a ""huge"" impact on the organised criminal gangs involved.
""Such an operation taking place in such a quiet, rural location will no doubt have caused some concerns for people in the area,"" he said.
""Our officers will be working with people in the local community in the coming days to provide reassurance.""
Police raided two other properties in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, and Quinton, Birmingham, in connection with an investigation into an organised crime network.
Warwickshire Police said two men, aged 40 and 60, were arrested in Buckinghamshire. A third man, aged 50, suspected of operating the lab, was apprehended at his home in Quinton.
While a man aged 36 and a woman aged 28 were arrested at a building on the site.
All five remain in custody where they are being interviewed, the force added.
Officers said searches of the farm buildings are ongoing, with support from specialist teams from West Midlands Police, West Midlands Fire Service and West Midlands Ambulance Service.
This operation is the latest in a string of cases which have resulted from the penetration of Encrochat.
French police obtained the messages of 9,000 British people using the service, and the NCA said the vast majority were using it for criminal purposes.
More than 1,500 people have been arrested in Operation Venetic, the British effort to analyse criminality using the messages.

726,15,encryption,Facebook encryption: Should governments be given keys to access our messages?,6 October 2019,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49933483,"Governments in the UK, US and Australia have asked Facebook, in an open letter, to roll back plans to bring end-to-end encryption to all of its platforms.
Facebook, rocked by privacy scandals, responds that everyone has the right to a private conversation.
It is the latest in an age-old battle between privacy and safety, which has played out between governments and tech firms ever since digital communication became mass market.
As the name suggests, this is a secure way of sending information so that only the intended receiver can read it.
The information is encrypted while it is still on the sender's device and is only decrypted when it reaches the person intended. Nobody, not even the platform owner, has the keys to unlock it.
It was introduced partly as a response to National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations that the intelligence services in the UK and US had many ways to intercept communication and were doing so on a mass scale.
The UK and the US have just signed an historic agreement to give each other a much faster way of getting hold of private conversations - cutting down the process time from months or years, to weeks or days.
But that agreement could potentially be rendered a bit useless, if they cannot read the scrambled messages.
When the BBC asked the Home Office to provide examples, it could not do so.
The real issue is the fact that Facebook will no longer be able to police its own content, it said.
It pointed to the fact that last year Facebook sent 12 million reports of child exploitation or abuse to the US's National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and it would no longer be able to do this if it had encryption on all its platforms.
It is something that Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg addressed directly in a Q&A with staff about the issue.
""When we decided to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this is one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,"" he said.
""There is more stuff on basically being able to identify patterns of activity, especially around sharing child pornography, and things like this that are just terrible, that I think you can probably find through patterns of activity and that we are going to ramp up investment of,"" he added.
He was keen to point out that the fact there was so much child abuse imagery reported via Facebook did not indicate that Messenger, the name of Facebook's direct messaging service, was the preferred platform for it, more that Facebook had become very good at finding it and sending it on.
""A backdoor is rather like leaving a key under the mat - once someone knows it is there anyone can walk in,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at the University of Surrey and a consultant to Europol.
His words were echoed by human rights pressure group Amnesty International in its response.
""Proposals for a 'backdoor' have repeatedly been shown to be unworkable. There is no middle ground: if law enforcement is allowed to circumvent encryption, then anybody can,"" it said.
Governments could also ask the social network to change the technical architecture of its platforms so messages could be decrypted when they reached the server. But that would signal a return to days of mass surveillance, thinks Prof Woodward.
""It's exactly what we had before Snowden's revelations and the reaction of the service providers was to introduce end-to-end encryption such that they could not disclose either the key or the decrypted message even if compelled to by law. The laws of mathematics currently trump the law of the land.""
And, of course, there is good old-fashioned policing - if the police request data from WhatsApp, they do get IP addresses, phone numbers and contact lists which could be useful in piecing together evidence, even without the full messages",Yes
727,16,encryption,Australia data encryption laws explained,7 December 2018,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46463029,"Australia has passed controversial laws designed to compel technology companies to grant police and security agencies access to encrypted messages.
The government says the laws, a world first, are necessary to help combat terrorism and crime.
However critics have listed wide-ranging concerns, including that the laws could undermine the overall security and privacy of users.
The laws were rushed through parliament on its final day of the year.
The Labor opposition said it had reluctantly supported the laws to help protect Australians during the Christmas period, but on Friday it said that ""legitimate concerns"" about them remained.
Cyber-security experts have warned the laws could now create a ""global weak point"" for companies such as Facebook and Apple.
Australia already has laws which require providers to hand over a suspect's communication to police.
This may already be possible if a service provider uses a form of encryption that allows them to view a user's message.
But in recent years, services such as WhatsApp, Signal and others have added an additional layer of security known as end-to-end encryption.
End-to-end encryption allows only the sender and recipient to view a message, preventing it from being unscrambled by the service provider.
Australia and other countries have said that terrorists and criminals exploit this technology to avoid surveillance.
It differs from laws in China, Russia and Turkey, where services offering end-to-end encryption are banned.
Under Australia's legislation, police can force companies to create a technical function that would give them access to encrypted messages without the user's knowledge.
""This ensures that our national security and law enforcement agencies have the modern tools they need, with appropriate authority and oversight, to access the encrypted conversations of those who seek to do us harm,"" Attorney-General Christian Porter said.
However, cyber-security experts say it's not possible to create a ""back door"" decryption that would safely target just one person.
""Any vulnerability would just weaken the existing encryption scheme, affecting security overall for innocent people,"" said Dr Chris Culnane from the University of Melbourne.
Such a ""security hole"" could then be abused or exploited by criminals, he said.
In a bid to address these concerns, Australia's law offers a safeguard which says decryptions won't go ahead if they create a ""systemic weakness"".
However critics say the definition of ""systemic weakness"" is vague, meaning it is unclear how it may be applied.
Digital rights advocates are highly critical of Australia's move, saying it lacks sufficient checks and balances.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said police could order individual IT developers to create technical functions without their company's knowledge.
""This has the potential for Australian tech firms to have no clue whether they were even subject to an order,"" the foundation's Nate Cardozo told the BBC.
There is also criticism over how fast the laws were passed. A draft bill was presented only in August.
A parliamentary committee examining the legislation did not release its report until late on Wednesday.
Labor initially proposed 173 amendments to the bill, but agreed to drop them on Thursday so that the law would be passed this year.
In return, the government pledged to debate possible amendments next year.
But the nation's top legal society, the Law Council of Australia, said on Friday that the laws had been ""rammed"" through the parliament with inadequate consideration.
If companies don't comply with the laws, they risk being fined.
That's led to speculation that some global firms which have vocally opposed the laws could withdraw from the Australian market.
However, Dr Culnane said that most companies are likely to comply - partly because users won't be aware if their messages have been accessed.
However, experts say the full implications are unclear and much uncertainty remains. Some firms have already suggested that they may not be subject to Australian law.
Experts add that, given the debate involves national security, many aspects may play out behind closed doors.",Yes

The men used EncroChat to arrange transporting Â£300,000 worth of cocaine and heroin from Liverpool to Nottinghamshire.
They discussed borrowing an ambulance to move the drugs and dressing women up as nurses to bypass coronavirus restrictions, police said.
Nottinghamshire Police have described the case as a ""massive breakthrough"".
David Martin, 42, of Third Avenue, Rainworth recruited drug couriers, Lee Bennett, 30, and Jamie Wilkinson, 45, as part of the deal.
All three men were sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply a controlled Class A drug.
Martin was sentenced to nine years in jail.
Wilkinson, of Ash Crescent, Nuthall, was jailed for four-and-a-half years and Bennett, of Kenbrook Road, Hucknall, was given a three-and-a-half year sentence.
EncroChat has been described by the National Crime Agency as a ""criminal marketplace"" used to trade drugs and guns.
In June last year it was successfully hacked in an operation led by French and Dutch police.
Nottinghamshire Police said this is the first time the force had successfully prosecuted some of those that were exposed.
Martin was a ""highly-placed member of a criminal drug dealing organisation"", the force said.
He was using EncroChat to negotiate the supply of drugs into Nottinghamshire between 31 March and 8 June 2020.
Police said Martin used the nickname Steelwhale and was boasting on the network about his business with suppliers in Liverpool.
They said he also discussed borrowing an ambulance to transport the drugs and dressing women up as nurses while coronavirus travel restrictions were in place.
Bennett and Wilkinson were sent to collect 5kg of cocaine and 2kg of heroin to the value of Â£300,000 and bring it back to Nottinghamshire, the force said.
Det Supt Mike Allen, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""Those committing some of the most serious crimes and who have thought of themselves as untouchable have been the authors of their own demise after policing gained access to their criminal marketplace and gathered evidence quietly.
""Such criminals deserve to spend their time in prison and whilst they are behind bars they are no longer a menace to the good people of Nottinghamshire.""
Both Bennett and Wilkinson were also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£181.

729,18,encryption,Lobbying row: Why ministers have two mobile phones,23 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-56842946,"The lobbying controversy that has enveloped Westminster is a complex and fast-developing story but there is one strand running right through the centre of it - the smartphone.
WhatsApp and text messages have replaced face-to-face meetings and letters as the favourite method of communication for politicians.
The casual, and sometimes untraceable, nature of these communications can make it harder for the Civil Service to ensure everyone - ministers, officials, businesses and lobbyists - plays by the rules.
It wasn't that long ago that everything was typed out in triplicate, and phone calls were routed through Whitehall switchboards, with officials listening in and taking notes.
Tony Blair didn't get a mobile phone until he left Downing Street in 2007. Now politicians, like the rest of us, can't live without them.
Following a series of revelations about ministers' use of texts and messaging apps, Labour has warned that the UK is heading towards ""government by WhatsApp"".
It's a catchy slogan, but it might be a bit dated, as the prime minister and other leading politicians are reportedly migrating to Signal, a rival messaging app.
Users can set encrypted messages to automatically delete after short periods of time, even as short as five seconds.
They can also stop screenshots being taken of exchanges if they are using an Android phone.
Messages sent and received on Facebook-owned WhatsApp - which has been around since 2009 - are also encrypted, but screenshots can be taken and shared.
Ministers are issued with work mobile phones when they get a job in government. Until a few years ago, they were given Blackberries, but now the iPhone seems to be the favoured brand.
The idea is to ensure that professional and personal calls, texts and emails are kept separate from their personal communications.
""I was given a phone as soon as I started,"" one former Conservative minister tells the BBC, ""but I wasn't sat down and issued with any advice on how to use it.""
A government source says: ""Clearly ministers may have informal conversations from time-to-time, whether that is in person, via digital communications or remotely, and if they find themselves discussing official business then significant content from such discussions should be passed back to officials.""
In official guidance, designed for private emails but applying to all electronic communications, ministers are told to work out whether they include details on ""substantive discussions"" or ""decisions"" made on government business.
If they do, they should then forward them to civil servants.
The ministerial code, laying out general rules of behaviour, says that a private secretary or another official should be present for ""all discussions relating to government"", to ensure transparency.
If that's impossible - such as when ministers chat to business leaders at social events - they have to report back to civil servants as soon as possible.
It's widely accepted that phone messaging should be reported in the same way if it's about important official business.
But the Institute for Government (IfG) think tank wants a tightening of the rules, so that all messages sent and received on official phones - about whatever topic - are logged, with the names of those taking part published quarterly. This already happens for meetings ministers attend.
""There needs to a public record that something's happened,"" IfG associate director Tim Durrant says. ""Texting's essentially a conversation, like a meeting.""
A source who used to work in Whitehall in a senior role says it was ""normal"" for ministers to have text exchanges with business leaders - and then let civil servants know about them.
""There's nothing wrong with the leaders of this country talking to captains of industry,"" they add. ""It's a part of how government functions. We live in a free country.
""What really annoys me is that there's an assumption of wrongdoing of some sort here. It's wrong to say government is run by text message. It's a form of communication that everyone uses for personal and official matters.""
Culture minister Caroline Dinenage told Times Radio ministers did not hand out their mobile numbers ""willy-nilly"" and there were ""very clear rules"" about handing contacts to civil servants.
But Labour argues that the government's use of messaging fosters ""cronyism"", that those with ministers' phone numbers have an unfair advantage over those who do not.
An ex-minister tells the BBC they kept personal and official messages completely separate when they were in office.
""You have to rely on people using their common sense,"" they add.
""Some ministers actually hand the work mobile across to be carried by a special adviser or a member of their team, so they're not too close to it and don't use it in an inappropriate way.
""You've also got to be careful as to whom you give your number out to.""
Some in government have suggested the prime minister should be less willing to share his personal contact details, the BBC understands, but officials have denied that he was told to change his number.
But Mr Johnson says he will keep his phone, arguing: ""I need to be in touch with people... You need one these days.""
And there would inevitably be resistance to any rule change among some in Whitehall.
One former special adviser asks: ""What are ministers supposed to do? Put in a 30-page submission for every transaction they carry out, even in the midst of a pandemic?""",Yes
730,19,encryption,"Encrypted messaging puts children at risk, commissioner warns",8 December 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55222499,"Encryption of online messages could make it harder to police child abuse and grooming online, the children's commissioner for England has warned.
End-to-end encryption is a privacy feature that makes it impossible for anyone except the sender and recipient to read messages sent online.
Commissioner Anne Longfield said it also prevented police from gathering evidence to prosecute child abusers.
But digital rights groups see it as an essential part of online privacy.
Facebook, which is behind the most popular messaging apps children use, already offers end-to-end encryption for Whatsapp.
It has added an opt-in version to its Messenger service, with plans to make it the default for all its platforms. That could include Instagram, which does not yet have it.
Ms Longfield's warning came as she launched a new report looking at how children used online messaging apps.
It found the vast majority of children aged eight and over used some sort of messaging service.
That includes 60% of eight-year-olds and 90% of 12-year-olds, despite the main such apps having an age restriction of at least 13, if not older.
More than a third of children surveyed for the report said they had received a message that made them feel uncomfortable.
One in 10 talk to strangers online, and one in 20 have shared videos or photos of themselves with strangers.
Ms Longfield said the report ""shows how vigilant parents need to be, but also how the tech giants are failing to regulate themselves and so are failing to keep children safe"".
She is calling on the government to make the big tech firms responsible when it introduces the long-delayed Online Harms Bill, with large fines for companies that breach their ""duty of care"".
She has warned against classifying encrypted messaging as ""private communications"". Doing so could offer an exemption for the tech giants on their duty of care, she said.
That ""could be a cynical attempt on the part of some tech firms to side-step sanctions and litigation"" she warned.
A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport responded: ""Children will be at the heart of our new online harms laws with tough sanctions on social media platforms that fail to protect young people from harm.
""We are clear that firms should only implement end-to-end encryption if it can be done without preventing action against child abuse.""
Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced in March 2019 that end-to-end encryption was going to become standard across Facebook's messaging platforms, the criticism of the plan has got ever louder.
Mr Zuckerberg himself has admitted that the move could harm the fight against child abuse. ""You're fighting that battle with at least a hand tied behind your back,"" he told a Facebook staff meeting.
Now the Children's Commissioner has joined those warning of the damaging effects of making messages too secret.
But her broadside may be aimed less at the tech firms than at the government, which she and other critics feel has dragged its heels on the issue of regulating online content.
A year and a half after the publication of  the Online Harms White Paper, there is still no clarity about when it will be turned into law and what sort of sanctions might be in it.
This week saw Labour's Margaret Hodge, a victim of online abuse, call for either an end to anonymity on social media or for directors of the platforms to be made liable for defamatory posts.
The critics' shopping list for measures against the tech giants is getting longer. Meanwhile, ministers must try to work out what is practicable as well as desirable.
The commissioner says that end-to-end encryption should not be applied at all to children's accounts, and that tech companies should ""retain the ability to scan for child sexual abuse material"".
""It's time for the government to show it hasn't lost its nerve and that it is prepared to stand up to the powerful internet giants, who are such a big part in our children's lives,"" she said.
Digital rights organisations, however, have long argued that encryption is essential.
The Open Rights Group accuses the government of using the Online Harms Bill to weaken security for everyone, warning that a ban on encryption ""would create a degree of surveillance and government intrusion that simply should not be tolerated in a democratic society"".
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, meanwhile, says encryption ""is one of the most powerful tools individuals have for maintaining their digital privacy and security in an increasingly insecure world"".
Facebook, as the owner of three messaging apps, said that child exploitation has ""no place on our platforms"" and that it has been ""developing news ways"" to prevent and detect abuse.
But it remains in favour of encryption, with added anti-abuse features.
""End-to-end encryption is already the leading technology used by many services to keep people safe"", a spokesman said.
""Through a combination of advanced technology and user reports, WhatsApp bans around 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery.""",Yes
731,20,encryption,"Microsoft hack: 3,000 UK email servers remain unsecured",12 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56372188,"More than 3,000 UK email servers remain at risk from the global Microsoft Exchange email flaw, officials believe.
The National Cyber Security Centre said it estimated 7,000 servers had been affected by the flaw in the UK and only half had been secured.
It said malicious software had been detected on 2,300 machines but it had helped businesses remove it.
The agency said it was ""vital"" that all affected businesses took action to secure their email servers.
The announcement reveals the scale of the problem among UK companies for the first time since the global security flaw emerged last week.
Ransomware groups have begun using the flaw to install their malicious programs, the NCSC warned - though there was no evidence of widespread ransomware attacks on UK companies so far.
Once installed, ransomware locks away a user's data behind strong encryption, making the computer system unusable. The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data.
The security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system, which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide.
The NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue.
Initially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data.
But after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw.
The result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack.
""We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,"" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned.
""While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates.""
He also urged all organisations to ""familiarise"" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised.
The true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone.
What is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact.
While many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low.
That may change in the coming days as more reports come in.
What is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come.",Yes
732,21,encryption,David Wilson: Sex offender who posed as girls online jailed for 25 years,10 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-56009383,"A man who posed as teenage girls online and blackmailed 51 boys into sending him indecent images of themselves has been jailed for 25 years.
David Wilson, 36, of Kirstead, King's Lynn, Norfolk, admitted 96 offences in November at Ipswich Crown Court.
In some cases he threatened to share indecent images of the boys online unless they sent him footage of them abusing younger siblings or friends.
The judge described Wilson as ""extremely dangerous"" and ""sadistic"".
The court heard some of the children who were groomed to abuse others had been arrested and one was now in a children's home.
Wilson's victims were aged between four and 14 and his crimes took place between 2016 and 2020, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.
He won their trust by sending sexual images of young women in exchange for photographs and videos of the victims themselves.
Wilson then used these images to blackmail his victims into sending more extreme content.
The NCA said he distributed images to some of his victims' friends, despite them begging him to stop, and some children spoke of wanting to end their lives as a result.
Sentencing, Judge Rupert Overbury described Wilson as a ""serial paedophile"" and ""an extremely dangerous individual"".
""You carried out a lengthy and premeditated campaign of sadistic and manipulative abuse of young boys using social media,"" he said.
""Any decent human being will be astonished at the level of depravity involved.""
One child was groomed while struggling with the effects of his father dying from cancer, the judge said.
Another pleaded for Wilson to stop as his grandfather was about to die but this had no effect on his abuser, he added.
Wilson pleaded guilty to 54 counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, 25 counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, 10 counts of causing a child to watch a sexual act, three counts of blackmail and four counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child.
He was ordered to serve a further eight years of extended licence once he is released from prison.
Officers began compiling intelligence on Wilson after Facebook identified 20 accounts of boys ranging from 12 to 15 years old, who had sent images of themselves to an account seemingly belonging to a 13-year-old girl.
The mother of one of Wilson's victims spoke of her concern over Facebook's plan to bring in end-to-end encryption of messages on the platform.
""I'm eternally grateful that David Wilson was caught,"" she said.
""I think that if it becomes too difficult for law enforcement agencies to track these people then we won't be able to protect our children and people like him will be able to get away with it.""
A spokeswoman for Facebook said: ""Child exploitation and grooming have no place on our platform.
""Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect, and respond to abuse and we will continue to work with law enforcement to combat criminal activity.""
Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""This sickening case is a chilling reminder of how crucial it is that tech companies play their part in combating child sexual abuse.
""It is vital that Facebook do not press ahead without amending their current end-to-end-encryption plans, otherwise sick criminals like David Wilson could still be abusing children with impunity.""
Tony Cook, head of child sexual abuse operations at the NCA, said Wilson ""preyed"" on his victims' ""vulnerability"".
""He groomed, bullied and blackmailed young boys into sending him indecent images and in some instances performing horrific abuse on themselves and others,"" he said.
""Despite knowing their utter anguish and despair he ignored their pleas from him to stop.""
Mr Cook urged parents to speak to their children about who they communicate with online and understand ""this can happen to anyone"".

733,22,encryption,Russia to block Telegram app over encryption,13 April 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43752337,"A court in Moscow has approved a request from the Russian media regulator to block the Telegram messaging app immediately.
The media regulator sought to block the app because the firm had refused to hand over encryption keys used to scramble messages.
Security officials say they need to monitor potential terrorists.
But the company said the way the service was built meant it had no access to customers' encryption keys.
Telegram had missed a deadline of 4 April to hand over the keys.
Russia's main security agency, the FSB, has said Telegram is the messenger of choice for ""international terrorist organisations in Russia"".
A suicide bomber who killed 15 people on a subway train in St Petersburg last April used the app to communicate with accomplices, the FSB said last year.
The app is also widely used by the Russian authorities, Reuters news agency reports.
In its court filing, media regulator Roskomnadzor said Telegram had failed to comply with its legal requirements as a ""distributor of information"".
Telegram's lawyer, Pavel Chikov, said the official attempt to stop the app being used in Russia was ""groundless"".
""The FSB's requirements to provide access to private conversations of users are unconstitutional, baseless, which cannot be fulfilled technically and legally,"" he said.
The messaging app is widely used across Russia and many nations in the Middle East, as well as around the rest of the world. It says it has more than 200 million active users.
Its popularity has grown because of its emphasis on encryption, which thwarts many widely used methods of reading confidential communications.
It allows groups of up to 5,000 people to send messages, documents, videos and pictures without charge and with complete encryption.
Telegram has been used by the Islamic State (IS) group and its supporters though the company says it has made efforts to close down pro-IS channels.",Yes
734,23,encryption,Message encryption a problem - Rudd,1 August 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40788180,"The major technology companies must step up their fight against extremism or face new laws, the home secretary has told the BBC.
Amber Rudd said technology companies were not doing enough to beat âthe enemyâ on the internet.
Encryption tools used by messaging apps had become a âproblemâ, she added.
Ms Rudd is meeting with representatives from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and others at a counter-terrorism forum in San Francisco.
Tuesdayâs summit is the first gathering of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, an organisation set up by the major companies in the wake of recent terror attacks.
In a joint statement, the companies taking part said they were co-operating to âsubstantially disrupt terrorists' ability to use the internet in furthering their causes, while also respecting human rightsâ.
Ms Rudd is expected to tell companies that extremists should not be allowed to upload content at all.
""Thatâs what weâre really trying to achieve,"" she told the BBC.
""What [technology companies] have been saying to us is using artificial intelligence, theyâre beginning to make progress in that way.â
Privacy rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation has expressed concern about the possibility of heavy-handed blocking of content.
It said such a move would have a significant impact on free speech online.
Encryption - a common feature of business and personal communications - was ""the duct-tape that holds the internet together"", said Ross Anderson, cryptography expert at the University of Cambridge.
He added that he was worried authorities and Silicon Valley firms were making an agreement behind closed doors that would ultimately undermine security.
End-to-end
In recent years, messaging services, including Facebook, Apple, and Google, have adopted end-to-end encryption, an added layer of complexity that makes it almost impossible for messages to be accessed without a userâs permission.
The measure has been heralded by the technology companies as a vital tool for privacy. But authorities around the world say end-to-end encryption has created unreachable parts of the internet.
Ms Rudd told the BBC that the UK government supported encryption, with caveats.
""We support its place in making sure that we have secure facilities in our daily lives,â the home secretary said.
""However, there is a problem in terms of the growth of end-to-end encryption.
""Itâs a problem for the security services and for police who are not, under the normal way, under properly warranted paths, able to access that information.
âWe want [technology companies] to work more closely with us on end-to-end encryption, so that where there is particular need, where there is targeted need, under warrant, they share more information with us so that we can access it.â
She said companies should give up more metadata about messages being sent via their services.
Metadata refers to information about a conversation - such as who took part, when and for how long - but not the contents itself.
When pressed on what kind of metadata she wanted, she replied: âIâm having those conversations in private.â
Technology companies are likely to resist any action that would result in them being seen to be sharing too much data with governments.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs programme, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warned about pushing criminals into even harder to reach parts of the internet.
""If people move off those encrypted services to go to encrypted services in countries that won't share the metadata, the government actually has less information, not more,"" she said.
Blocking uploads
Ms Rudd said if the companies did not take it upon themselves to clamp down on the spread of extremist content, new legislation could be introduced.
âNone of this material should be online. They need to take ownership over making sure it isnât,â Ms Rudd told the BBC.
""Itâs governments that need to urge them to really take action so that we donât have to go down the road of legislation - and get them to do it on a voluntary but urgent basis.
âLegislation is always an alternative.â
Specifically, the home secretary said, companies must seek to block material at source - building on efforts already put in place by companies such as Facebook.
âThey have to make sure the material terrorists want to put up gets taken down,â she said, ""or, even better, doesnât go up in the first place.""
David Greene, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said rights campaigners were concerned this approach would lead to content being blocked incorrectly.
âWeâre concerned that itâs going to lead to more takedowns,â he said, ""not more terrorist content but more content thatâs mistaken for terrorist content being taken down.â

735,24,encryption,Encryption on Facebook Messenger and other chat apps,21 March 2018,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-43485511,"Facebook has a stored copy of your private messages because it doesn't use end-to-end encryption - and it's not the only one.
Encryption scrambles messages so that if they're intercepted while being delivered they cannot be read.
Most messaging services use a level of encryption, but there are different types.
Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat are other services that don't use end-to-encryption.
Facebook Messenger encrypts messages by default from the sender to its server, and then encrypts them again between the server and the recipient.
End-to-end encryption, used by WhatsApp, doesn't have the stop in between.
Usually the only people with the 'key' to decipher an end-to-end encrypted message are the sender and the intended recipient.
The messaging service can't read the message.
It's particularly useful for sending sensitive information like bank details, which you wouldn't want to fall into the wrong hands or be stored anywhere online.
There's been a big discussion about end-to-end encryption and the problems it causes for policing.
Khalid Masood accessed WhatsApp moments before he killed four people in the Westminster terror attack. He also used iMessage and SMS.
After the attack, Home Secretary Amber Rudd called it ""completely unacceptable"" that the security services couldn't access some of the content - and said ""there should be no place for terrorists to hide"".
At the time, a WhatsApp spokeswoman said the company was ""horrified at the attack"" and was co-operating with the investigation.
But since then, Amber Rudd has repeated her call for messaging services to work more closely with government to stop criminals misusing apps.
Whatsapp, which is owned by Facebook, added end-to-end encryption by default in 2016, with Facebook saying that protecting private communication was one of its ""core beliefs"".
But its native Facebook Messenger doesn't have the same levels of security.
You have to specifically enable something called ""secret conversation"" within the Messenger app in order for your conversations to have end-to-end encryption.
Facebook-owned Instagram does not use end-to-end encryption on the photo-sharing app, which introduced private messaging in 2013.
Twitter doesn't either, while there's nothing on Snapchat's website to suggest messages on the app are completely encrypted.
Its support page does say that most messages are deleted from its servers after a maximum 30 days.
And Skype, which also has no information on end-to-end encryption on its website, has been trialling a ""private conversation"" option with some users.
Newsbeat has contacted Snapchat and Skype for clarification.
Well, as mentioned above the main player in end-to-end encrypted messaging is WhatsApp, but Apple also uses it.
Its 'approach to privacy' document says it ""uses end-to-end encryption to protect your iMessage and FaceTime conversations"" across all devices.
But Apple also allows users to send messages as a text if the iMessage won't go through, and text messages are not end-to-end encrypted.
A lot of messaging services, like iMessage, allow you to back up to the cloud, which gives those cloud services access to your messages.

Several apps encrypt communications end-to-end, which stop messages being legible if intercepted by criminals or law enforcement.
In a speech, Rod Rosenstein said law enforcers were increasingly thwarted by such encryption.
He met Home Secretary Amber Rudd on Thursday to discuss the issue.
He will also meet the head of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency.
""Increasingly, the tools we use to collect evidence run up against encryption tools which are designed to defeat them,"" said Mr Rosenstein, speaking at the Global Cyber Security Summit in London.
He said the United States was ""co-ordinating with our foreign partners as to what the challenges are"".
With end-to-end encryption, messages are scrambled when they leave the sender's device and are decrypted only on the receiver's device.
It means service providers such as WhatsApp cannot hand over a legible copy of a suspect's messages to law enforcement, because they do not have one.
Mr Rosenstein said technology companies often ""resisted co-operating with governments"".
Ms Rudd has also described encryption tools used by messaging apps as a ""problem"".
In August, she met representatives from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and others at a counter-terrorism forum in San Francisco.
She called on companies to work ""more closely"" with the government but said she did not want to ""weaken encryption"".",Yes

The UK's adversaries were already using the technology, it said.
The agency has published a paper, Ethics of AI: Pioneering a New National Security, saying the technology will be put at the heart of its operations.
And officials say it will help analysts spot patterns hidden inside large - and fast growing - amounts of data.
This could include:
But it cannot predict human behaviour such as moving towards executing a terrorist attack.
The paper also sets out how GCHQ wants to support the AI sector, including setting up an industry-facing AI lab from its Manchester office, dedicated to prototyping projects and mentoring start-ups.
And GCHQ says it details how it will ensure it uses AI fairly and transparently, including:
It is a sign the agency wants to avoid a repeat of criticism people were unaware how it used data, following whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations.
""While this unprecedented technological evolution comes with great opportunity, it also poses significant ethical challenges for all of society, including GCHQ,"" the agency's director, Jeremy Fleming, said.
""Today, we are setting out our plan and commitment to the ethical use of AI in our mission.
""I hope it will inspire further thinking at home and abroad about how we can ensure fairness, transparency and accountability to underpin the use of AI.""
It comes as the government prepares to publish its Integrated Review into security, defence, development and foreign policy, in which technology, including AI, is expected to play a central role.
GCHQ outlined areas where adversaries were already using AI, including:
A growing number of states are using AI to automate the production of false content to affect public debate, including ""deepfake"" video and audio, GCHQ warns.
The technology can individually target and personalise this content or spread it through chatbots or by interfering with social-media algorithms.
But it could also help GCHQ detect and fact-check it and identify ""troll farms"" and botnet accounts.
GCHQ says AI could:
Increasingly used to automate cyber-attacks, AI could also help identify malicious software and attackers as they continually develop new tactics to breach systems and steal data, GCHQ says.
Organised crime groups are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of technology, including encryption tools, the dark web and cryptocurrency, GCHQ says.

738,27,encryption,WhatsApp to go ahead with changes despite backlash,19 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56127220,"WhatsApp is pushing ahead with controversial changes to its terms of service, but altering the way it notifies users following a backlash.
After its first announcement in January, millions of users downloaded apps from WhatsApp's competitors.
The Facebook-owned platform previously said it had been the victim of ""misinformation"" around the change.
But WhatsApp now says it has ""reflected"" on how it could have explained the changes better.
The phrasing of the warning in the initial push led to widespread fears that it was going to share large amounts of WhatsApp data with Facebook.
In reality, very little had changed in that area - and almost all users had previously accepted the type of data sharing involved.
As part of its second attempt to convince users, WhatsApp will begin displaying a banner alert within the app in the coming weeks.
It encourages users to learn more about the update and what is - and is not - changing.
Messages informing users of the update will also be displayed in the status section of the app.
The new terms are scheduled to come into effect on 15 May.
WhatsApp says the data it shares with its parent company does not include messages, groups or call logs.
Instead, it says the new terms focus on changes to allow users to message businesses.
WhatsApp already shares information with Facebook, such as your IP address and information about your phone, as well as purchases made via the platform.
However this does not apply in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist.
But privacy experts say the saga highlights how unaware users are of how their data is being used.
""In its efforts to clarify that [it] isn't doing anything wrong, Whatsapp has in fact inadvertently highlighted that it was already harvesting huge amounts of data for Facebook,"" said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.
That ""vindicates"" those who decided to leave Whatsapp, he said.
""The biggest takeaway from all of this is that Whatsapp was already harvesting device level identifiers, IP addresses, and purchase info on behalf of Facebook - and that until recent media attention, the general public was largely unaware.""
Whatsapp said it had ""reflected on what we could have done better here"".
âWe want everyone to know our history of defending end-to-end encryption, and trust weâre committed to protecting peopleâs privacy and security.""

740,29,encryption,David Wilson: The King's Lynn roofer who lured sex victims by posing as a girl,10 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-55979555,"They were lured in by messages seemingly from a teenage girl. From there, the young victims were not only enticed into sharing sexualised images of themselves but in some cases blackmailed to commit abuse by proxy on their younger siblings. How was David Wilson - the man behind the teenage girl mask - eventually caught?
David Wilson, a roofer who lived at his mother's Norfolk home, was ""one of the most prolific offenders"" the National Crime Agency (NCA) had ever come across.
From his bedroom in Kirstead in King's Lynn, the 36-year-old built a web of false personas to target thousands of children both in the UK and abroad.
At Ipswich Crown Court on Wednesday, Wilson was sentenced to 25 years for 96 child sex offences.
As many as 500 victims sent him images. One of them told the BBC how they felt ""trapped inside his game"".
And yet the first concerns about Wilson's behaviour came not from the victims themselves, or from police intelligence - but from a Facebook algorithm.
Those involved in bringing him to justice now fear whether Facebook plans to use end-to-end encryption might mean people like Wilson might evade justice in the future.
Wilson's modus operandi was deception and blackmail.
He created fake personas of young girls and then used pre-paid mobile telephones to target boys, the majority of whom were aged between 11 and 13 years old, via social media.
""Once he made contact, he coerced those children to abuse themselves or others and produce images of that abuse,"" said Rob Jones, director of the National Crime Agency.
""As soon as Wilson established a relationship he would incite and blackmail and really try to establish control over that child by threatening them to a whole range of different tactics which were designed to allow him to control the child to commit abuse and and to victimise other children.""
Once he had a compromising image of a child, Wilson would then use it to blackmail the victim into sending increasingly extreme imagery of themselves or, in some cases, to commit sexual abuse - or ""contact offending by proxy"" - on their siblings.
One of his victims was just four years old.
""It is happening in people's homes - created by people like Wilson, who is able to do it remotely because of access to social media platforms and the use of false personas,"" said Mr Jones.
The case against him involved 51 boys. But officers unearthed hundreds of victims who had been lured into sending images of themselves by Wilson.
""Those he was abusing had no idea who he was,"" said Mr Jones.
By the time Wilson was charged, officers had evidence of seven fake female identities, 14 separate social media accounts and five pre-paid mobile telephones.
All had one user - David Wilson.
One of his victims is now 16 years old. He was 11 when he was first contacted by Wilson.
""I was completely unaware of dangerous people online and in the world,"" the boy said.
When he set up his social media account he had a number of friends on there - and a girl purporting to be about 12 years old.
""She contacted me and I had a look at her account to see what she looked like. She looked like a normal girl, about my age, and it didn't concern me, and she also talked and approached me in a way that was very normal,"" he said.
""It didn't alarm me so I decided to carry on talking to her thinking it was just a girl my age. Over time, I was attracted to this person who I thought was a pretty young girl, but as it progressed I began to feel very alarmed by the way they started to talk to me.
""I was concerned that this wasn't a girl and I was very scared. I kept on asking him to leave me alone and the only way he would leave me alone was if I sent him indecent images.""
In a desperate bid to free himself from Wilson, the boy agreed to send some sexual images of himself.
Two years later the boy was approached by a second ""girl"" online. The boy asked her to leave him alone but the ""girl"" refused and said they had indecent images of him from two years ago.
""I was very, very scared,"" the boy said. ""She requested more indecent images and if not [supplied] she would spread it all across the internet, despite knowing I was extremely frightened.
""I was trapped inside his game.""
Tony Cook, the NCA's head of child exploitation and online protection, said: ""These children and their families had their lives turned upside down - some of them never recover psychologically.
""I must pay tribute to the bravery of the people who came forward. They've been very patient with us.
""He was getting them to do very, very depraved and degrading acts.
""It doesn't bear thinking about what he was having those children do.""
The social media giant Facebook uses an algorithm to ""scan"" messages sent over its platform.
""They are able to detect the type of behaviour in messaging and in the exchange of images which is indicative as the sexual abuse of children,"" said Mr Jones.
""They are really, really good at that.""
Intelligence from Facebook was shared with the NCA in 2017 which identified 20 accounts of boys aged between 12 and 15 years old sending indecent images of themselves to an account of a 13-year-old girl.
Wilson's case was one of 90 referrals made to the NCA from Facebook, via the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.
From the information from Facebook, detectives were able to put together their case.
The IP addresses used to commit the crimes were linked to his mother's home. They had CCTV footage of him buying a top-up voucher for a phone linked to one of his fake accounts. And when he was arrested in August 2017, the telephone used to commit some of the offences was found hidden in his bedroom.
But at that stage, the full scale of Wilson's offending remained unclear.
Officers wanted to examine evidence from his Snapchat, Google and Instagram accounts too.
That involved filing an International Letter of Request to the US authorities.
It was nearly two years before the NCA received its data trove from the US.
It contained more than 250,000 messages for detectives to pore over. It revealed Wilson's victims lived across the UK, the US and Australia.
By the time Wilson was charged for crimes committed between 2016 and 2020, he had been arrested on four separate occasions.
He admitted to all 96 offences at Ipswich Crown Court in November 2020, but all those crimes took place after he was first arrested by Norfolk Police on 4 April 2015.
That arrest was connected with two counts of possessing indecent images of children. No action at that stage was taken by police.
Responding to the BBC's questions about that first arrest, a spokesperson for Norfolk Constabulary said: ""Officers carried out a search of the property and investigated the matter, however found no evidence to link him to the crimes and consequently no action was taken.
""Due to ongoing concerns around safeguarding, he was subject to further measures through a multi-agency Local Authority Designated Officer meeting where a referral was made to the Disclosure and Barring Service.
""This meant employers would be informed of the concerns and the Football Association were also made aware as he had connections to children's football.""
But it did not stop his offending - not even after the National Crime Agency got involved.
The NCA arrested Wilson three times during its three-year investigation - in August 2017, January 2018 and finally in April 2020.
""He continued to offend even when we'd arrested him. And we arrested him three times, so he was a pretty determined individual,"" said Mr Cook of the NCA.
""He's been grooming and preying on very vulnerable young children and getting them to send him very indecent imagery of themselves and doing very degrading acts and then blackmailing them.
""I don't think you get more despicable than that, do you?""
But the NCA said it was not in a position to charge him before 2020.
""When you're dealing with somebody who has given a fake identification we have to be 100% certain that that person we arrest and charge is the person who is behind the fake identities,"" said Mr Cook.
""That takes a lot of time. It is just one of those things - you've got to piece together the evidence like a jigsaw puzzle until you can prove that the fake identities are linked to David Wilson.""
The NCA now feared whether it will be able to bring people like Wilson to justice in the future.
Its concerns, the agency said, stem from proposals within Facebook to use end-to-end encryption in its Messenger platform.
Mr Jones said had such encryption been in place in 2017 it would have been ""highly unlikely"" Wilson would have been caught.
""Had that content been end-end-encrypted, there is a real risk that justice would not have been served and Wilson would still be abusing victims today,"" he said.
A spokesman for Facebook said: ""Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect, and respond to abuse and we will continue to work with law enforcement to combat criminal activity.""
The company told the BBC child exploitation had ""no place"" on its platforms and said it would ""build on"" the ""strong anti-abuse capabilities"" of one of its platforms (WhatsApp) when it rolled out end-to-end encryption in its other messaging services.

741,30,encryption,Technology and science move to the heart of UK security,16 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56421662,"National power will be defined not by the number of tanks and ships a country possesses but by its science and technology, and the quality of its algorithms.
That is the message of the UK's Integrated Review, which says the government's aim is for the country to become an innovation ""superpower"" by 2030.
""This will be essential in gaining economic, political and security advantages in the coming decade,"" it says.
It marks a major strategic shift in thinking. But delivery will not be straightforward.
A global tech race is heating up.
China this month announced its latest five-year plan, including significant increases in research and development spending.
It highlighted seven areas including:
The Biden administration, meanwhile, is focusing on maintaining America's edge.
A report this month led by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt focused on the security risks of falling behind China in AI.
Wars of the future may involve AI algorithms battling each other.
The first nation to master this and other technologies may not just have a significant military advantage on the battlefield, but also in protecting its people at home and in spurring economic growth.
That is why the UK's review says its ""first goal"" is growing the UK's science and technology power ""in pursuit of strategic advantage"".
""We need to generate strength through technological innovation,"" former MI6 Chief Alex Younger told the BBC.
Some of this focuses on traditional areas. At least Â£6.6bn of defence funding over the next four years will go on research and development.
Some of this will support industries in particular regions of the UK - a sign of the fusing of security and economic priorities.
In addition, a national space strategy will be launched, as well as a new cyber-strategy that could see more frequent use of offensive capabilities by the new National Cyber Force.
UK investment will be dwarfed by China and the US. But the ambition is that a more activist, industrial policy can create ""thriving ecosystems"" in crucial areas.
Three fields are picked out for case studies.
One is quantum computing, where the review argues the UK is ""well placed to emerge as a global leader"".
The much-heralded quantum breakthrough will offer major advantages to those who get there first.
This includes one field governments do not talk about: breaking the encryption which keeps messages secret.
Another is engineering biology - the design and redesign of biological systems through techniques like gene editing.
This has potential for health and environmental benefits but also, as the report notes, defence and security.
US intelligence officials have suggested China was exploring gene-editing its soldiers to improve their performance.
The third is AI. The UK is home to cutting-edge research. But critics also say it highlights some of the historic problems in commercialising domestic innovation.
London-based DeepMind is world-class, but sold itself to Google. The US may be a close ally, but there are still officials who believe the shift of ownership represented a strategic loss.
The failure to take UK research and grow tech giants from it is not a new problem.
The UK built the first semi-programmable computer in World War Two to break codes at Bletchley Park.
But it did so in secret and the computing industry it led to has been limited in terms of scale.
By contrast the US, with a revolving door between government and the private sector, massive investment from the Pentagon and spy agencies, and a larger domestic market, created Silicon Valley.
There is also a question about where it will be practical to try to convince what is a highly international workforce at UK companies and universities, to work on defence and security-related projects.
In the US, a staff revolt led Google to pull out of Project Maven which wanted to use AI to tag objects in drone-collected video.
Other US companies have been more willing to work with the Pentagon.
But copying the military-civil fusion that China talks about may not be either desirable or possible.
One criticism of the review is that it tries to have it both ways with China - stressing the need to be open to Beijing for trade and investment, while also engaging in systemic competition.
This is not always easy. Last year's decision to effectively kick out Huawei from 5G telecoms showed hard choices are sometimes involved.
In areas like 5G, the focus today is not just on developing cutting-edge technology, but also in setting global standards and rules for the future.
And here China has invested heavily.
The UK will need to work hard with allies to catch up and convince other countries to share its vision.
That is just one of the areas where becoming a science and tech superpower may be a tough promise to deliver on.",Yes
742,31,encryption,Man denies role in sex club murder of Dutch crime writer,7 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-56665537,"A Scottish man has denied being involved in serious organised crime, including the murder of a Dutch crime writer.
Christopher Hughes, 32, faces three charges which span an eight-year period between December 2011 and January 2020.
They include the killing of Martin Kok, 49, who was shot dead at a sex club in the Dutch town of Laren in 2016.
Donald Findlay QC pled not guilty on behalf of Mr Hughes during a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
The indictment against Mr Hughes alleges he was involved with others in ""serious organised crime"" with locations including Scotland, Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Italy as well as Holland.
It is said he was involved in the importation of cocaine and possessed firearms with the intention of supplying weapons to individuals.
The charge also claims Mr Hughes concealed money - described as ""criminal property"" - and that cash was used to pay for weddings, school fees, holidays, watches and cars.
It is further stated ""encrypted"" devices - created to help hide illegal activities from the authorities - were supplied to others named in the charge, including the late Mr Kok.
The second charge accuses Mr Hughes of being involved in the supply of cocaine.
The final accusation details the alleged murder of Mr Kok in December 2016.
Mr Hughes is alleged to have been involved in the killing with a named individual and others.
Mr Findlay told the court investigations into the case were ongoing.

Experts believe officials must have copied and pasted chunks of text from old legislation into the document.
The references are on page 921 of the trade deal, in a section on encryption technology.
It also recommends using systems that are now vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
The text cites ""modern e-mail software packages including Outlook, Mozilla Mail as well as Netscape Communicator 4.x.""
The latter two are now defunct - the last major release of Netscape Communicator was in 1997.
The document also recommends using 1024-bit RSA encryption and the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which are both outdated and vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
""It's clear that something is amiss in the drafting of this treaty, and we'd go so far as to venture the opinion that a tired civil servant simply cut-and-pasted from a late-1990s security document,"" news site Hackaday commented.
Several people have suggested the words were copied from a 2008 EU law, which includes the same text.
Prof Bill Buchanan, a cryptography expert at Edinburgh Napier University, said there was ""little excuse"" for the outdated references.
""I believe this looks like a standard copy-and-paste of old standards, and with little understanding of the technical details.
""The text is full of acronyms, and it perhaps needs more of a lay person's explanation to define the requirements.""
Although SHA-1 and 1024-bit RSA ""were a good selection a decade or so ago, they are no longer up to modern security standards,"" he added.
The Brexit negotiations finally ended on Christmas Eve, with a deal which was more than 1,200 pages long.
Ambassadors from the 27 EU member states have unanimously approved the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal.
The UK Parliament is expected to approve it on Wednesday, paving the way for it to take effect provisionally on 1 January ahead of a European Parliament vote.
The Home Office said the paragraphs ""set out the legally prescribed measures for cooperation.""

745,34,encryption,Petya ransomware encryption system cracked,11 April 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36014810,"Petya ransomware victims can now unlock infected computers without paying.
An unidentified programmer has produced a tool that exploits shortfalls in the way the malware encrypts a file that allows Windows to start up.
In notes put on code-sharing site Github, he said he had produced the key generator to help his father-in-law unlock his Petya-encrypted computer.
The malware, which started circulating in large numbers in March, demands a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (Â£265).
It hid itself in documents attached to emails purporting to come from people looking for work.
Security researcher Lawrence Abrams, from the Bleeping Computer news site, said the key generator could unlock a Petya-encrypted computer in seven seconds.
But the key generator requires victims to extract some information from specific memory locations on the infected drive.
And Mr Abrams said: ""Unfortunately, for many victims extracting this data is not an easy task.""
This would probably involve removing the drive and then connecting it up to another virus-free computer running Windows, he said.
Another tool can then extract the data, which can be used on the website set up to help people unlock their computer.
Independent security analyst Graham Cluley said there had been other occasions when ransomware makers had ""bungled"" their encryption system.
Cryptolocker, Linux.encoder and one other ransomware variant were all rendered harmless when their scrambling schemes were reverse-engineered.
""Of course,"" said Mr Cluley, ""the best thing is to have safety secured backups rather than relying upon ransomware criminals goofing up.""",Yes
746,35,encryption,Update: Encryption row intensifies,18 November 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34864457,"So, there have been a few important developments since I published my story looking at the encryption debate surrounding how terror groups can communicate.
First - messaging app Telegram says it has blocked 78 accounts that were being used by the so-called Islamic State group to communicate propaganda. It was ""shocked"" to learn the service was being used in this way. Worth stressing, again, that the BBC reported this fact weeks ago.
My colleagues at BBC Monitoring told me that since the account closures, several new pro-IS channels have been set up on Telegram, rapidly amassing followers.
However, I've just checked one of these new channels and it has been disabled, suggesting Telegram is, like many other apps, engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with extremists.
Second - the call for encryption backdoors has, as predicted, intensified.
The Manhattan district attorney has published a report demanding that a method to access passcode-locked phones be built in to iOS and Android, the two major players in mobile software.
The document reads: ""Apple and Google are not responsible for keeping the public safe. That is the job of law enforcement.
""But the consequences of these companies' actions on the public safety are severe.""
My colleague Chris Baraniuk has been covering the report today.  Read his story here.
And finally, in Paris, there's doubt that the attackers were using encrypted messaging apps at all - according to The Intercept, citing French newspaper Le Monde, communications about the atrocity were sent using bog-standard SMS text messages.

747,36,encryption,Encrypted phone cracked to convict drug dealer,18 August 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-53820002,"A drug dealer caught after police cracked an encrypted phone full of damning messages has been jailed for eight years.
Darren Collin's arrest led to the seizure of Â£1.3m worth of heroin and cocaine as well as Â£517,000 in cash.
A Berlingo van he was driving in Glasgow was found to have a secret compartment used to smuggle drugs..
An encrypted mobile also contained incriminating messages to Collin, whose user name was ""Big Poppa"".
Collin was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow having earlier admitted to being concerned in the supply of heroin and cocaine.
He was brought to justice as part of the UK-wide Operation Venetic during which experts managed to crack the encryption used by Encrochat - a global communication system used by criminals.
The court heard he was under police surveillance in April this year, and was seen driving an expensive Audi SQ7 before getting into the van.
He later carried out what appeared to be drug transactions including collecting three large tubs in the Dawsholm Road Industrial Estate near the city's Anniesland.
When he was stopped soon afterwards, mobile phones were found including a white V Smart device which was encrypted.
When decrypted, it emerged Collin had texted ""Been caught"" to an associate moments after he was stopped.
The device revealed Collin was regularly in touch with 10 contacts who had nicknames including ""icecream"", ""blackhorse"", ""magicstopper"" and ""tinthepark.com"".
Prosecutor Chris McKenna said: ""There are further significant messages relating to what is assessed to be criminality such as images of white blocks.
""These are potentially cocaine with different logos embossed as well as large sums of money and tick lists.""
The court heard there were also ""detailed instructions"" given to Collin by a contact on how to package cash and where to drop it off.
A flat in Anniesland linked to Collin was then raided where police found large consignments of heroin, cocaine, cash and substances used to bulk out drugs. Other related equipment, including a hydraulic press,  were seized.
The heroin was valued at Â£820,500 with the cocaine at Â£505,580.
The judge, Lord Armstrong, said Collin's level of involvement showed the drug operation was ""organised and planned"" and he would have received a 12-year sentence had it not been for his guilty plea.
His defence counsel said Collin had been hit with ""financial difficulties"" after a back injury affected his work as a lift engineer.
Frances Connor QC said: ""His father is a successful businessman, but he was too embarrassed to approach him for help. He does accept the foolishness of that.""
Collin was also given a three-year Serious Crime Prevention Order designed to tackle and monitor criminals on their release from jail.
Welcoming the conviction, Det Ch Supt Philip Chapman said: ""We are absolutely committed to disrupting those involved in serious and organised crime in Scotland.
""We recognise the impact this criminal activity has on individuals and the misery that it brings to our communities.""",Yes
748,37,encryption,"Lockdown bomb hoaxer targeted NHS, MPs and BLM protests",26 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56204359,"An Italian man in Germany has been sentenced to three years in prison for threatening to bomb NHS hospitals, Black Lives Matter rallies and UK MPs.
Emil Apreda, 33, sent emails from Berlin demanding Â£10m worth of Bitcoin to not carry out the attacks.
The National Crime Agency said he made his threats in the spring and summer of 2020 as the NHS struggled with Covid.
Senior officers kept the threats from the public for fear of patients being scared into not attending hospitals.
Apreda used encryption techniques and the dark web in an attempt to hide his identity, but police brought in behavioural, linguistics and cyber-crime experts to track him down.
He sent emails to the NHS pretending to be a far-right activist linked to the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, but police believe that was just a ruse to instil fear.
He was finally identified by German detectives and armed officers raided his home in Berlin on 15 June last year.
For the first time, the NCA has revealed details of the case, calling it ""one of the most significant threats we've seen for some time"" which took place at a time of ""deep and heightened anxiety"" in the UK.
Tim Court, the NCA's head of investigations, said the content of the emails was ""so threatening and so damaging"" that it was only disclosed to a ""very tight circle of people - and I mean very tight"" within the police and government.
Meanwhile, security at hospitals was quietly stepped up.
Mr Court said the risks were both of loss of life and a loss of confidence in the NHS.
""At the height of this, we were losing nearly nearly 1,000 people a day - and for six weeks we're trying to manage somebody who could have been planting a bomb in a hospital, somewhere in the UK.""
A particular concern was that many patients were on ventilators or oxygen at the time, and it would have been more difficult to get them out of a hospital in the event of a credible bomb threat.
The extortion campaign started on 26 April when Apreda sent an email to the NHS, making his demand for Bitcoin and warning that he would send a bomb in a package to a hospital in the UK if he was not paid.
This was followed by an identical email to an NCA control centre, followed by 16 more over six weeks.
During that period, the death of George Floyd in the US and resulting protests in the UK prompted threats from him to blow up Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
Finally, as the fourth anniversary of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right activist approached, he emailed that he would kill MPs - but did not name any.
Police behavioural and linguistics experts drew up a profile of the extortionist, who they decided was not from the UK.
Police say further ""technical leads"" pointed to Germany. He was finally identified by LKA, the German CID.
Apreda had been issuing deadlines for payment after which he said he would attack, so the day before the anniversary of Ms Cox's death, German police moved in, blowing open the front door of his Berlin flat and arresting him.
Police say he has background in computing, but they have discovered no links to Combat 18, despite his claims.
The far-right group has been active in the UK in the past, but now exists mainly in the US and Germany.
Apreda was charged and convicted of extortion in Germany, but the NCA said he could have faced terrorism charges if he had been brought to the UK.
The NCA  said he had no links that they could find with Britain, and therefore extraditing him had not been possible. It denied Brexit had been a major factor.",Yes
749,38,encryption,Euro MPs back end-to-end encryption for all citizens,19 June 2017,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40326544,"A European Parliament committee is proposing that end-to-end encryption be enforced on all forms of digital communications to protect citizens.
The draft legislation seeks to protect sensitive personal data from hacking and government surveillance.
EU citizens are entitled to personal privacy and this extends to online communications, the proposal argues.
A ban on ""backdoors"" into encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram is also being considered.
Encryption involves digitally scrambling a communication to protect its contents, and then using a digital key to reassemble the data.
End-to-end encryption means the company providing the service does not have access to the key, meaning it cannot ""listen in"" to what is being shared - giving the sender and recipient added confidence in the privacy of their conversation.
""The principle of confidentiality should apply to current and future means of communication, including calls, internet access, instant messaging applications, email, internet phone calls and personal messaging provided through social media,"" said a draft proposal drawn up for the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs.
The proposal seeks to amend Article Seven of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights to add online privacy. It will require approval by committee's members, the wider European Parliament and the Council of Ministers before it can be passed into law.
During the UK's recent election campaign, the Conservative Party said that tech firms should provide the authorities ""access to information as required"" to help combat online radicalisation, but ministers have also said they do not want to weaken encryption.
That has led to some confusion among tech industry leaders as to whether the government wants some kind of ""backdoor"", a way to have end-to-end encryption disabled in specific cases, or some other action.
However, cyber-security experts warn that criminals can still find a way to protect their communications, even if end-to-end encryption is banned.
""There are lots of existing techniques law enforcement can use,"" Dr Steven Murdoch, a cyber-security researcher in the department of computer science at University College London told the BBC.
""One of them is traffic analysis, which is looking at patterns of communications, eg who is talking to who, when and from what location.
""The other one is hacking - equipment interference in British law - which can happen before data is encrypted and after it's been decrypted, so there are still ways for law enforcement to gain access to information.""
In the Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks, the perpetrators were already known to UK security services, Dr Murdoch added.
""They were not stopped because there were either insufficient resources or the resources were not sufficiently prioritised,"" he said.
""The suggestions being considered by the UK government would be worse for computer security. So much of people's lives are now carried out online. We should have privacy online just as we have offline.""",Yes

751,40,encryption,Phone encryption: Police 'mug' suspect to get data,2 December 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38183819,"Detectives have developed a new tactic to beat criminals using mobile phone encryption - legally ""mug"" them.
The tactic has emerged after Scotland Yard's cybercrime unit smashed a fake credit card fraud racket.
Officers realised crucial evidence in the investigation was concealed on a suspect's iPhone - but it would be unobtainable if the device was locked.
So a covert team seized it in the street while the suspect was on a call - beating the security settings.
The street seizure of the phone was dreamt up by detectives from Operation Falcon, the specialist Metropolitan Police team running investigations into major fraud and related crimes organised online.
Gabriel Yew had been under investigation for the suspected manufacture of fake cards that gangs were using across Europe to buy luxury goods. Detectives suspected that he was using an iPhone exclusively to communicate to other members of the network but knew if they arrested him, he could refuse to unlock it and they would never see incriminating evidence.
They considered whether they could legally force a suspect's finger or thumb on to the device's fingerprint reader to unlock it, but found they had no such power.
However, they concluded they could stage their own lawful ""street robbery"" - using a similar snatch technique to a thief - and in June a team set out to do precisely that.
Undercover surveillance officers trailed Yew and waited for him to unlock his phone to make a call - thereby disabling the encryption.
One officer then rushed in to seize the phone from Yew's hand - just as would happen in a criminal mugging. As his colleagues restrained the suspect, the officer continually ""swiped"" through the phone's screens to prevent it from locking before they had downloaded its data.
""The challenges of pin code access and encryption on some phones make it harder to access evidence in a timely fashion than ever before,"" said Det Ch Insp Andrew Gould who led the operation.
""Officers had to seize Yew's phone from him in the street. This evidence was crucial to the prosecution.""
The phone revealed a motherlode of information on Yew's efficient business-like practices. He had orders for fake cards and there was evidence linking him to four men who were subsequently convicted and a further 100 potential suspects.
Detectives also uncovered Yew's ""factory"" with thousands of blank credit cards ready to be programmed.
Yew pleaded guilty to fraud and weapons offences and at a sentencing hearing this week at Blackfriars Crown Court was jailed for five and a half years.",Yes
752,41,encryption,Whatsapp adds end-to-end encryption,5 April 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35969739,"Instant messaging service Whatsapp has announced it will encrypt all its users' communications from Tuesday.
With end-to-end encryption, messages are scrambled as they leave the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the recipient's device.
It renders messages unreadable if they are intercepted, for example by criminals or law enforcement.
Whatsapp, which has a billion users worldwide, said file transfers and voice calls would be encrypted too.
The Facebook-owned company said protecting private communication was one of its ""core beliefs"".
Encryption was thrown under the spotlight after the FBI asked Apple to help it access data on an iPhone used by California gunman Syed Farook.
Whatsapp said: ""The idea is simple: when you send a message, the only person who can read it is the person or group chat that you send that message to. No one can see inside that message. Not cybercriminals. Not hackers. Not oppressive regimes. Not even us.""
Users with the latest version of the app were notified about the change when sending messages on Tuesday. The setting is enabled by default.
Amnesty International called the move a ""huge victory"" for free speech.
""Whatsapp's roll out of the Signal Protocol, providing end to end encryption for its one billion users worldwide, is a major boost for people's ability to express themselves and communicate without fear,"" the organisation said in a statement.
""This is a huge victory for privacy and free speech, especially for activists and journalists who depend on strong and trustworthy communications to carry out their work without putting their lives at greater risk.""
Whatsapp's decision was also welcomed by security professionals.
""Wire-tappers lament, law-abiding citizens rejoice, for WhatsApp's latest update is a victory for communications privacy,"" said Lee Munson, a security researcher for Comparitech.
""With the ability to access data removed even from the company behind the app, only ill-informed law enforcement agencies are likely to mutter 'terrorists' as the masses enjoy the encrypted text messages, photos, video and phone calls they've been demanding ever since Edward Snowden blew the lid on government surveillance.""
The move is likely to irk law enforcement agencies, particularly the US Department of Justice which has recently expressed concern over ""unreachable"" information contained in devices. The DoJ did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on Tuesday.
Indeed, FBI attorney James Baker has reportedly criticised the move saying encryption threatens the work of law enforcement.
""It has public safety costs. Folks have to understand that, and figure out how they are going to deal with that,"" he said, according to the US News and World Report news site.
""Do they want the public to bear those costs? Do they want the victims of terrorism to bear those costs?""

753,42,encryption,Global tech giants back encryption,24 November 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34910007,"Weakening encryption in the wake of the Paris terror attacks ""does not make sense"", say some of the world's biggest technology firms.
A statement about encryption was released by the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) - a  policy body that represents tech giants.
Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Samsung and many other computer industry firms are all ITIC members.
It said encryption helped preserve safety and security every day.
The ITIC is a global lobby and policy group that communicates the views of tech firms to politicians and legislative bodies.
The statement comes after many politicians criticised the data-scrambling systems that tech firms are increasingly applying to hardware and services.
They have called for encryption to be weakened in order to help police and intelligence services catch criminals or thwart potential terror attacks. Others want backdoors included in encryption software that would give law enforcement access to data that is otherwise locked away.
But, said the ITIC, weakening encryption in a bid to help the ""good guys"" was a mistake.
Doing so ""would actually create vulnerabilities to be exploited by the bad guys"", it warned.
Such a move ""would almost certainly cause serious physical and financial harm across our society and our economy"".
""Weakening security with the aim of advancing security simply does not make sense,"" said the ITIC.",Yes

IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the proposals were released to the public without his knowledge.
The new law would have forced Indians to store plain-text versions of their encrypted data for 90 days and make it available to security agencies.
The draft policy sparked outrage on social media, as most messaging services use some form of encryption.
The encryption policy was proposed to enhance information security in India.
On Monday night the government exempted social media applications from the draft policy after social media outrage.
The ""draft encryption policy is not the final view of the government. It will be redrawn to specify who it will apply to,"" Mr Prasad told reporters on Tuesday.
He said the purpose of the policy was ""not related to social media messaging platforms used by the common man.""
The draft said Indians have until 16 October to weigh in on the proposed measures, and the government had said that the final policy would only be drafted after all feedback is taken into account.

Two men from South Tyneside have been arrested on suspicion of importing and supplying drugs.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) has been investigating after parcels of MDMA destined for Europe, Asia and the USA were intercepted last summer.
Operations manager Martin Clarke said the gang had been ""preying on the vulnerable and destroying communities"".
""This investigation shows that those who try to use the dark web and encrypted communication devices to anonymously commit crimes can be identified,"" he said.
Drugs with a street value of Â£4.3m had been recovered, including MDMA, amphetamines and more than 6,000 Diazepam (alprazolam) tablets, the agency said.
Officers seized mobile phones, computers and drug packaging paraphernalia.
Encrypted messages were analysed to identify those selling drugs and laundering money using cryptocurrency.
The drugs were being imported from Holland and then sold on the dark web under four names: HundredsUK, Hundredsandthousands, Sundaefundae, and 100and1000s.
Two men, aged 24 and 31, have been arrested in South Shields and Hebburn on suspicion of importing and supplying Class A, B and C drugs.
Officers searched other addresses in South Shields and an address in Epsom, Surrey.
The agency was still looking for two people from South Shields who are believed to be overseas, it said.

756,45,encryption,Pentagon invites hackers in and backs encryption,2 March 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35706988,"The Pentagon has invited external experts to hack into its systems in the first such test of its cybersecurity measures.
The method is often used by private companies that want to use the expertise of ""friendly"" hackers to find holes in their systems.
It came after the US defence secretary backed strong encryption amid the FBI's phone unlocking row with Apple.
Ash Carter called on tech firms and the US government to work together.
The US Department of Defense launched its Hack the Pentagon project on Wednesday, inviting vetted outside hackers to test the security of some of its public websites.
According to the Reuters news agency, the programme will be modelled on the hacking bounties often run by firms, in which experts are offered incentives to identify and report security issues. The Pentagon said it was also considering offering financial rewards.
""I am confident that this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defences and ultimately enhance our national security,"" Mr Carter said.
The Pentagon has long tested its own networks using internal so-called ""red teams"" but this initiative - the first such scheme to be run by the US federal government - would open at least some of its vast network of computer systems to cyberchallenges from across industry and academia.
However, the Pentagon said that other more sensitive networks or key weapons programs would not be included in the scheme, at least initially. ""The goal is not to comprise any aspect of our critical systems, but to still challenge our cybersecurity in a new and innovative way,"" one senior defence official told Reuters.
The official said they expected thousands of qualified participants to sign up ahead of the pilot scheme's opening in April.
During a visit to Silicon Valley on Tuesday, Mr Carter underscored the US military's support for data security and strong encryption. Speaking on the day that both Apple and the FBI appeared before the US congress over the former's refusal to help the latter overcome an iPhone's encryption protection, he said that the Pentagon viewed strong encryption as critical.
Reuters reported that Mr Carter declined to address a live case directly and said that no one case should drive policy decisions. But he did call for greater co-operation between Silicon Valley and Washington on data security.
He said that a failure to work together would allow China, Russia and others who he said did not favour a free internet to set new global standards, according to the news agency.
""We shouldn't let the solutions to this larger issue of how to handle data security as a society be driven by any one particular case,"" Mr Carter told reporters after a speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco. ""It would be unreasonable.""
In his speech, Mr Carter said: ""It is easy to see wrong ways to do this. One would be a law hastily written in anger or grief. Another would be to have the rules be written by Russia or China.""
On the same day, it was announced that the Turing Award had been given to a pair of cryptographers whose ideas helped make the internet possible.
According to the Associated Press, the recipients - Whitfield Diffie, a former chief security officer of Sun Microsystems, and Martin Hellman, a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford University - said that giving governments control over encrypted communications would put everyone at risk.
The pair were chosen for the $1m (Â£700,000) award for contributions to computing for the ideas of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which they introduced in 1976.
The concepts now secure all kinds of data, from online communications and financial transactions to internet-connected infrastructure like power plants, the AP agency reported.",Yes
757,46,encryption,How did governments lose control of encryption?,2 March 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35659152,"The clash between Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades.
Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called ""Crypto Wars"".
Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI.
In 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised ""public key cryptography"", which revolutionised encryption.
""The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East.
""They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element?
""The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes.
""Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command.
""They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever.
""But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications.
""That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it.
""[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market.""
Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
""Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful.
""The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom.
""There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government.
""The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction.
""Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge.
""But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly.
""Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home.
""But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies.
""It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure.
""The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government.
""Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad.
""In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle.""
Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles.
""Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side.
""In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message.
""You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since.
""It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with.
""Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted.
""They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used.  They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies.
""They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems.
""You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form.
""All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out.""
Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013.
""I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies.
""When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic.
""The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies.
""They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption.
""So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort.
""Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet.
""I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret.
""Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that.
""The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy.
""I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent. What I would say is I like that this fight is happening in public so that we can have debates like this.""

758,47,encryption,Dutch government says no to 'encryption backdoors',7 January 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35251429,"The Netherlands has said it will not force tech firms to share encrypted communications such as emails with its security agencies.
The move puts the country in stark contrast with US and UK officials, who have argued agencies need such access to fight terrorism.
The Netherlands began reviewing its policies after the recent Paris terrorist attacks.
But this week it said ""restrictive"" measures would put citizens at risk.
Encryption is a way of protecting communications or data so that it is incomprehensible without the correct passcode or key.
Advocates say it protects users by preventing criminals and spies from prying into private conversations.
But security agencies have said they struggled to bypass encrypted messaging platforms used by groups such as so-called Islamic State to plan attacks.
""We are not some kind of maniacs who are ideologues against encryption,"" FBI director James Comey said in November:
""But we have a problem that encryption is crashing into public safety and we have to figure out, as people who care about both, how to resolve it.""
In a letter published this week, the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice concluded there were arguments for and against ""strong encryption"".
However, it said allowing law enforcers to access protected data would make digital systems vulnerable to ""criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services"".
""This would have undesirable consequences for the security of information stored and communicated and the integrity of ICT systems, which are increasingly of importance for the functioning of the society,"" it added.
Despite objections from the FBI, the White House has dropped plans to force tech firms to share encrypted data.
But the UK government hopes to secure such powers through its Draft Investigatory Powers Bill - referred to by some as the Snooper's Charter.
The bill also includes a stipulation that internet and phone companies keep records of every website, app and service to which a computer connects.
The proposals have met with fierce resistance from privacy advocates and tech firms.
Some fear it will legitimise the mass surveillance programmes of the US and UK security agencies uncovered by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013.
In December, Apple told a parliamentary select committee scrutinising the bill that ""in this rapidly evolving cyber-threat environment, companies should remain free to implement strong encryption to protect customers"".
And this week, William Binney, ex-technical director of the US National Security Agency, said the bill would be ""totalitarian"" and ""cost lives"".
""It is 99% useless,"" he said in a letter sent to MPs.

760,49,encryption,Amazon makes U-turn over Fire tablet encryption,7 March 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35744338,"Amazon has pledged to restore disk encryption security protection to its mobile operating system.
The firm had faced criticism after it emerged that the feature had been dropped in a recent update to Fire OS.
Amazon had justified the move by saying that ""customers weren't using"" the privacy facility. It now intends to reintroduce it before the end of May.
Disk encryption has become a topical issue as it lies at the heart of a clash between Apple and the FBI.
The facility digitally scrambles data on a device, making it impossible to make sense of it unless a passcode or other ID check is provided.
The dispute involving Apple concerns the tech firm's refusal to alter its own mobile operating system to prevent an iPhone's data being wiped if too many incorrect passcode guesses are typed in.
Amazon has publicly backed Apple's stance via a legal filing known as an amicus brief, which was submitted to a US court last week.
Amazon removed disk encryption when it released Fire OS 5 last year. It included the operating system with its Fire tablets, as well as its TV-streaming devices.
However, a backlash only occurred after Amazon started making the update available to owners of its older Fire tablets, who noticed the security facility was no longer available.
""I will no longer be able to keep my business email... as our institution requires that encryption be used,"" wrote one tablet owner on the firm's forums. ""I cannot believe Amazon just 'deleted' this critical feature.""
Another posted: ""In an era where devices store information on everything from browsing habits to bank information it's nearly unthinkable for a company to deliberately remove the one feature that can protect a customer from identity theft if their device is lost or stolen.""
The firm reversed its stance over the weekend.
""We will return the option for full disk encryption with a Fire OS update coming this spring,"" a spokesman told the BBC.
The flip-flop has not affected the firm's continued use of encryption to protect data sent between its devices and its data centres.
Fire OS is a variant of Android.
Google offers full device encryption in its version of the operating system, and in October told device manufacturers that it should be switched on by default in new handsets powerful enough to support it.
One expert suggested Amazon should take a similar step.
""There's growing recognition that better security is needed in the whole sphere of computing and particularly mobile devices,"" commented Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London.
""So, I was surprised when Amazon removed the feature.
""It's certainly possible that many people didn't enable it - perhaps they found it inconvenient to do so. But rather than remove it, a better solution would be to make it more easy to use.""",Yes
761,50,encryption,Can the government ban encryption?,13 January 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30794953,"Whenever the terrorist threat is increased, as it has been since the tragic events in Paris last week, so too are the calls from politicians to increase the powers of the people they employ to protect the public from such threats.
Those agencies can only do their job, the argument goes, if they have full access to the online chatter of those planning terrorist atrocities.
As the UK's Prime Minister David Cameron put it in a speech this week - there should be no ""means of communication"" which ""we cannot read"".
But in an era when communication takes many forms, and with the added problem that much of this communication is encrypted, how easy is it to turn this sound bite into reality?
For Mr Cameron the answer lies in a new ""comprehensive piece of legislation"" that will close the ""safe spaces"" used by suspected terrorists.
So what are those safe spaces?
Although Mr Cameron doesn't name any, it is likely he is referring to new apps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat which allow people to chat with relative anonymity by keeping their services encrypted.
But the battle is much more wide-ranging as established names such as Google and Apple promise to do more to ensure that encryption is used as default on their services. After the revelations from whistle-blower Edward Snowden about mass surveillance programs, firms are determined to be seen to be putting the control of their data back in the hands of consumers.
In the past, governments with the appropriate warrants could go to firms such as Apple and ask them to unlock the communications on phones.
No more. Apple has changed its infrastructure to make it impossible for it to hand over any data from the iPhone 6's iMessage service, for example.
Such military-grade lock-down of devices inevitably terrifies governments so it should come as no surprise that they are fighting back with new legislation.
Although, it should be noted, that the new legislation Mr Cameron referred to in his speech is probably just a resurrection of an old law.
The Draft Communication Bill of 2012, dubbed the ""snoopers' charter"" by critics, aimed to extend the range of data that communication companies had to store for 12 months.
It would have included, for the first time, details of messages sent on social media, webmail, voice calls over the internet and gaming. Officials would not have been able to see the content without a warrant but the bill was blocked by the Liberal Democrats.
Politics continues to dog attempts to revive it with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying after Mr Cameron's latest speech that his party will continue to oppose any such legislation.
At the heart of the debate is the question about how the government deals with the fact that communication data is increasingly being encrypted.
As Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert from the University of Surrey, puts it: ""You can have all the legislation in the world but you still might not be able to read what you've got.""
Encryption has long terrified governments.
The so-called crypto-wars began in the 1970s when the US government attempted to classify encryption as munition.
The Clinton administration in the 1990s tried to get industry to adopt the so-called Clipper chip - an encryption chip for which the government had a backdoor.
The US government also tried to introduce something called key escrow - a policy that all encryption systems should leave a a spare key with a trusted third party.
When software developer Phil Zimmermann developed PGP, a free mass-market encryption product for emails and files, the US government attempted to prosecute him because someone had exported his software from the US without government permission.
And, however outrageous this may sound now, those two options remain the only ones for the government as, two decades later, they grapple with exactly the same issues.
So does the idea of a golden key, a backdoor for the security service, make any more sense now than it did in the 1990s?
Certainly the threat from terrorism is greater and few would argue with the sentiment that, if you are in danger and a police officer turns up at your backdoor - you are going to let them in.
But the analogy implies that someone has control over who uses the backdoor and, of course, in the software sense this is impossible.
A backdoor in software is not just something for the security service. Anyone - including the criminals - may discover it and exploit it.
""A UK cryptographic backdoor would become the number one global target for cybercriminals. The UK government would not be able to keep it secure for long, particularly if it needed to give access to police and security services,"" said Matthew Bloch, managing director of internet hosting firm Bytemark.
All of this has been debated before, of course.  Ahead of the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which came into force in 2000, both options of a backdoor and the idea of a key stored by a third party were considered and rejected by lawmakers.
They opted instead for a third way - that someone in possession of an encryption key should be forced to hand it over to the authorities.
That too is fraught with complexities.
Often the person simply doesn't know the key.
""It comes down to passwords on laptops and you can't force someone to hand these over,"" said Prof Woodward.
And encryption technology is evolving.
""Now there is a way of protecting secret information into the future so if a key is compromised the key agreed for a particular session changes,"" he explained.
""There are even technologies emerging that can give a false key which makes the system aware that the key was given under duress and wipes the data.""
The technology industry tends to have a knee-jerk reaction to attempts from government to interfere in its processes.
Don't mess in things that you don't understand, they warn. The technology genie is out of the bottle and cannot be put back.
In this particular case, some have interpreted Mr Cameron's words as meaning that the government is seeking to ban, in effect, a technology that underpins the global economy.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption protects financial details when people shop or bank online while so-called end-to-end encryption such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) help keep personal messages private.
""Encryption is mathematics, not technology. It can't be suppressed by law,"" Mr Bloch told the BBC.
Whatever route the government elected in the UK in May decides to go, Prof Woodward hopes that it will listen carefully to the technology industry.
""The government will need to take a lot of wide-ranging advice as this has the potential to go spectacularly wrong.""
It is also worth noting, he added, that the men involved in the Paris shootings were known to the authorities and had been under surveillance until it was deemed that the threat from them had lessened.

Gary McGeown, 34, of Belfast Road, in Newry, County Down, appeared at court in Newry via video-link.
He is facing a number of drugs charges as well as a charge of converting criminal property.
Deputy District Judge Trevor Browne refused bail, stating that it is ""too dangerous"" to consider at this time.
The court heard that the charges arise from a search of Mr McGeown's business premises on Tuesday.
Prosecution barrister Robin Steer told the court that during the search of a trailer containing ceramic tiles, police found bags of suspected cannabis.
Some of the bags were found in what were described as ""hides"" inside the tile boxes.
The prosecution said that there were also empty boxes with hides found in the haulage yard.
A search of Mr McGeown's home was also conducted.
A police officer told the court that during this search, three chargers for what police believe was an encrypted phone were found. A phone was not found.
The court heard that data obtained by French authorities had been passed to the National Crime Agency (NCA) and subsequently to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) which they believe connects Mr McGeown to the use of an encrypted phone.
The prosecution objected to bail stating that their main concern is the potential ""obstruction of the police investigation"".
A defence barrister said that Mr McGeown had co-operated fully during interview.
He said that he had answered every question put to him and  ""had exhibited the actions of a man with nothing to hide"".
The defence barrister added: ""In terms of interfering with the investigation, the police already have everything.
""He has given them access to CCTV and passcodes for phones.
""He has nothing to do with the contents of the trailer.""
However, Deputy District Judge Trevor Browne refused bail stating that it is ""too dangerous at this stage to consider bail"".
Mr McGeown is to appear in court again on 28 April.",Yes
763,52,encryption,India exempts social media from encryption policy,22 September 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34322040,"The Indian government has exempted social media applications from a new encryption policy after public uproar over the proposed measures.
The new law would have forced Indians to store plain-text versions of their encrypted data for 90 days and make it available to security agencies.
The policy sparked outrage on social media, as most messaging services like WhatsApp use some form of encryption.
Online banking and purchases will also be exempt from the law.
Indians have until 16 October to weigh in on the proposed measures, and the government has said that the final policy will only be drafted after the feedback is taken into account.
The encryption policy was proposed to enhance information security in India.
But experts argue that if enforced in its current form, the policy could make personal information vulnerable to hacking.
Plain text files like a Word document or email are not encrypted and can be read by anyone.",Yes
764,53,encryption,Europol chief warns on computer encryption,29 March 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32087919,"A European police chief says the sophisticated online communications are the biggest problem for security agencies tackling terrorism.
Hidden areas of the internet and encrypted communications make it harder to monitor terror suspects, warns Europol's Rob Wainwright.
Tech firms should consider the impact sophisticated encryption software has on law enforcement, he said.
Mr Wainwright was talking to 5 Live Investigates.
A spokesman for TechUK, the UK's technology trade association, said: ""With the right resources and cooperation between the security agencies and technology companies, alongside a clear legal framework for that cooperation, we can ensure both national security and economic security are upheld.""
Mr Wainwright said that in most current investigations the use of encrypted communications was found to be central to the way terrorists operated.
""It's become perhaps the biggest problem for the police and the security service authorities in dealing with the threats from terrorism,"" he explained.
""It's changed the very nature of counter-terrorist work from one that has been traditionally reliant on having good monitoring capability of communications to one that essentially doesn't provide that any more.""
Mr Wainwright, whose organisation supports police forces in Europe, said terrorists were exploiting the ""dark net"", where users can go online anonymously, away from the gaze of police and security services.
But he is also concerned at moves by companies such as Apple to allow customers to encrypt data on their smartphones.
And the development of heavily encrypted instant messaging apps is another cause for concern, he said.
This meant people could send text and voice messages which police found very difficult or impossible to access, he said.
""We are disappointed by the position taken by these tech firms and it only adds to our problems in getting to the communications of the most dangerous people that are abusing the internet.
""[Tech firms] are doing it, I suppose, because of a commercial imperative driven by what they perceive to be consumer demand for greater privacy of their communications.""
Mr Wainwright acknowledged this was a result of the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who exposed how security services were conducting widespread surveillance of emails and messages.
He said security agencies now had to work to rebuild trust between technology firms and the authorities.
The TechUK spokesman told the programme: ""From huge volumes of financial transactions to personal details held on devices, the security of digital communications fundamentally underpins the UK economy.
""Encryption is an essential component of the modern world and ensures the UK retains its position as one of the world's leading economies.
""Tech companies take their security responsibilities incredibly seriously, and in the ongoing course of counter-terrorism and other investigations engage with law enforcement and security agencies.""
The programme also found evidence that supporters of the Islamic State (IS) are using encrypted sites to radicalise or groom new recruits.
On one blogging website, a 17-year-old girl who wants to become a ""jihadi bride"" is told that if she needs to speak securely she should use an encrypted messaging app.
The family of 15-year-old Yusra Hussein from Bristol, who went to Syria last year, also believe she was groomed in this way.
The extent of the challenge faced by security services is shown in the scale of social media use by IS.
Mr Wainwright revealed that IS is believed to have up to 50,000 different Twitter accounts tweeting up to 100,000 messages a day.
Europol is now setting up a European Internet Referral Unit to identify and remove sites being used by terrorist organisations.
Mr Wainwright also says current laws are ""deficient"" and should be reviewed to ensure security agencies are able to monitor all areas of the online world.
""There is a significant capability gap that has to change if we're serious about ensuring the internet isn't abused and effectively enhancing the terrorist threat.
""We have to make sure we reach the right balance by ensuring the fundamental principles of privacy are upheld so there's a lot of work for legislators and tech firms to do.""

765,54,encryption,GCHQ boss: Tech firms should co-operate over encryption,7 March 2016,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35750127,"The head of GCHQ has called for greater co-operation between spies and tech companies in dealing with challenges posed by encryption.
Robert Hannigan said the encoding of data was being misused by a small number of people.
He said the rational response was not to think encryption was bad, but to look for pragmatic ways of responding.
Mr Hannigan was speaking as the FBI engages in a legal battle with Apple over the firm's encryption systems.
At an event at MIT in Boston, Mr Hannigan, director of the UK government's communications intelligence agency, said it should be up to politicians - not companies or spies - to set the parameters.
On his first day in charge of GCHQ in November 2014, Mr Hannigan wrote an opinion piece for the Financial Times accusing US tech companies of becoming the ""command and control network of choice"" for terrorist groups.
A year and a half later in Boston, Mr Hannigan conceded the comments caused a bigger stir than he expected and said they were wrongly seen as an attack on the tech industry.
The tone of his latest intervention was conciliatory, focusing on the need for government agencies and companies to work together to find solutions.
""We need a new relationship between the tech sector, academia, civil society and government agencies. We should be bridging the divide, sharing ideas and building a constructive dialogue in a less highly-charged atmosphere,"" he told the audience.
Apple has designed phones with strong encryption which made it impossible for the company to retrieve data for the state, including in the case of one of those involved in the San Bernadino attacks.
The company and its supporters have stressed that creating any form of ""key"" for the government to unlock data would also create a vulnerability for hackers and others to exploit.
Mr Hannigan did not mention Apple directly but emphasised the way in which GCHQ supported strong encryption because of the agency's role in protecting British data from hackers and other states.
He also pointed to the agency's pioneering work such as that of Alan Turing in World War Two who worked not just on breaking codes but also on securing speech through encryption.
Mr Hannigan said two previously secret papers from 1970 by James Ellis, a leading GCHQ cryptographer, were being declassified which showed the early work on developing what became the now widely used system of public key cryptography.
That kind of innovation was what Mr Hannigan said he wanted to see today in dealing with the modern challenges surrounding encryption.
""The solution is not, of course, that encryption should be weakened, let alone banned. But neither is it true that nothing can be done without weakening encryption,"" he said, adding that it was wrong to see every attempt to tackle the misuse of encryption by criminals and terrorists as a ""backdoor"".
Mr Hannigan reiterated that the British government position - as set out in the new investigatory powers bill - would not outlaw the type of end-to-end encryption which is at the heart of the row between Apple and the FBI.
Instead, he said, it will demand companies take reasonable and practical steps to provide data when demanded.
""Within the parameters set by legislation, it should be possible for technical experts to sit down together and work out solutions to particular manifestations of the abuse of encryption.""
Such conversations were more common before the Snowden revelations, officials say, but since then companies have withdrawn and referred requests to their lawyers.
The decision about where to draw the boundaries was not one for either the companies or the spies, Mr Hannigan said, but instead for lawmakers.
""It is not for me, as an intelligence official and civil servant, or for a law enforcement officer to make these broad judgements, whether about the use of data in general or encryption in particular; nor is it for tech company colleagues nor even for independent academics.
""Since the trade-offs are for society as a whole, it must surely be for elected representatives to decide the parameters of what is acceptable.""
Antony Walker, deputy chief executive of techUK, an organisation which represents tech firms, said the solution lay in government, academia and industry working together.
""These are hugely complex issues,"" he said. ""This speech makes it very clear that there are no easy answers. It is a realistic assessment of the trade-offs that need to be made to secure our digital world.
""We must not jeopardise our long-term security.""",Yes
766,55,encryption,Paris attacks: Silicon Valley in crosshairs over encryption,18 November 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34855462,"Grief over the Paris attacks will soon make way to demands for action.
As well as increased military activity, and the controversial suggestions to close the door on refugees, the next battle in the ""surely something can be done"" arena will be aimed squarely, and angrily, at Silicon Valley.
Tech companies were already under pressure to make it easier for governments to access ""private"" communication apps and services. Those calls have intensified greatly since the attacks in Paris.
""If you create a product that allows evil monsters to communicate in this way, to behead children, to strike innocents - whether it's at a game in a stadium, in a small restaurant in Paris, take down an airline - that is a big problem,"" Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC.
""We need hi-tech's help in securing an internet [where] even with a court order you can't get to what they're saying.
""That's a big problem.""
The ""problem"" is to do with encryption.
Without encryption, all of the things we do online would be insecure, be it emailing, or shopping, or banking. They all rely on the principle that if you encrypt data using complex mathematics it is nigh-on impossible to crack.
If you're using communication apps such as WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, WeChat and so on, your messages are encrypted by default.
It means that even if those companies wanted to hand over your messages to law enforcement, they couldn't.
That's bad, some say.
""There are a lot of technological capabilities that are available right now that make it exceptionally difficult, both technically as well as legally, for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need to uncover it,"" said CIA director John Brennan at a security forum on Monday.
""And I do think this is a time for particularly Europe, as well as here in the United States, for us to take a look and see whether or not there have been some inadvertent or intentional gaps that have been created in the ability of intelligence and security services to protect the people that they are asked to serve.""
An opinion column in the New York Times, authored by Manhattan's district attorney, and the City of London Police commissioner, said ""encryption blocks justice"".
In the piece, published back in August, they wrote about a murder near Chicago in which a father of six had been shot. At the scene, officers found two mobile phones. But they were passcode locked. Neither Google or Apple (the phones ran their software) could unlock the phones, and therefore the data was inaccessible.
""On behalf of crime victims the world over,"" the opinion piece read, ""we are asking whether this encryption is truly worth the cost.""
It's an argument that can be made with more vigour than ever after the Paris attacks.
With access to communications, the anti-encryption advocates say, we could perhaps stop these tragic events from occurring. That's a claim worth scrutinising.
It's early days in the investigation, and no evidence has yet been offered to show that encrypted communications were used to organise the atrocity.
But, given that much of the world's population - from gossiping teenagers to deal-making business people - are using encryption regularly, it's not a wild assumption to consider that the attackers were too.
But technology industry is, on the whole, against the suggestion that law enforcement should have ""backdoors"" into popular services - the term given to a hidden way of circumventing the app's security.
A backdoor, in the infosec world, is the term given to a method in which a supposedly secure system can be accessed. It could be a quirk in some code, or a vulnerability in how a system communicates. Whatever the weakness, typically, once backdoors are made public, they are fixed.
Hackers make serious money by discovering backdoors and selling them on - often to government security services.
Many in law enforcement and government feel there should be a backdoor made just for those in authority to investigate and stop criminals and terrorists.
But some of tech's most influential figures say that the notion of a secure, secret backdoor is dangerously misguided.
If any backdoor exists, hackers will find it eventually. It would mean data security for all of us, not just criminals, would evaporate.
The Edward Snowden leaks about mass surveillance changed the landscape in this debate dramatically.
Faced with user backlash over apparent cooperation with the US government, technology companies were desperate to show they could be trusted.
They quickly implemented changes that were essentially designed to put them in a position of being able to credibly say: ""Listen, even if we wanted to help, we couldn't.""
""If the government laid a subpoena to get iMessages, we can't provide it,"" said Apple boss Tim Cook, speaking last year to US public broadcaster PBS.
""It's encrypted and we don't have a key. And so it's sort of - the door is closed.""
For a company that is reluctant to say much about anything, Apple is bullish on encryption. At a dinner event earlier this year, Mr Cook pressed home his view.
He said calls for intentional backdoors for government as an attack on ""civil liberties"".
""If you put a key under the mat for the cops,"" he said.
""A burglar can find it too.""
But Silicon Valley companies are preparing themselves for a backlash against this attitude.
Post-Snowden, the Obama administration was compelled to rejig its rules over data gathering, acknowledging that some of the actions of its security services were unconstitutional.
Great news for Silicon Valley and privacy advocates.
Gone is the wholesale collection of some types of data. In its place, a more selective means of data mining, but, crucially, a backing off of trying to get Apple et al to back down on their views over encryption.
But after Paris, we could see a shift in momentum.
A memo uncovered by the Washington Post, sent three months ago by Robert Litt, a lawyer working for the US National Intelligence office, said that while attitudes towards creating government backdoors were ""hostile"", that atmosphere ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement"".
Paris may just be that event.
But if it is, how effective would those suggested measures be?
One of the apps being used extensively by so-called Islamic State is Telegram, a secure messaging app founded by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov.
The app allows broadcast channels, and my colleagues at BBC Monitoring logged that at least 4,500 people were listening to IS's channel on Telegram.
Any US decision to force back doors into software wouldn't affect what Telegram does. The company is based in Berlin. Any attempt by European authorities would probably fall on deaf ears - the Durovs are no strangers to evading what they see as government meddling.
Pavel Durov founded VKontakte (known now as VK), a social network with the lion's share of audience in Russia. It's not unfair to call it a Facebook clone - it looks almost identical.
When Russian authorities wanted more access to the discussions on VK, Pavel fled.
Telegram has repeatedly ignored the BBC's request for comment on this, and other, stories.
But on Instagram, Pavel made his feelings on the Paris attacks clear.
""I think the French government is as responsible as IS... for this, because it is their policies and carelessness which eventually led to the tragedy,"" he said.
""They take money away from hardworking people of France with outrageously high taxes and spend them on waging useless wars in the Middle East and on creating parasitic social paradise for North African immigrants.
""It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of short-sighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place.""
In a comment posted to his profile on VKontakte, Pavel, as quoted by the Moscow Times, mocked the suggestion his app should be blocked.
""I propose banning words,"" he said. ""There's evidence [to suggest] that they're being used by terrorists to communicate.""
The attitude displayed by Pavel Durov exposes, pro-encryption advocates say, the inherent flaw in the argument for allowing government access.
If Apple, Google, Facebook and others were compelled by law to introduce backdoors, terrorists would probably just move, as they have done already, to other platforms with a more anarchistic approach.
It would leave services ""normal"" people use far less secure, while dangerous people would be operating on systems that are even harder to gain access to, with proprietors who are proudly anti-government.
In the coming days, statements from politicians and law enforcement will be made, directed at the technology companies that handle our day-to-day communications.
They'll be forced to look cooperative while not undermining the promises they made after the Snowden revelations.
Put up against military or diplomatic action, taking affirmative steps against communication apps may seem an easy win in the war against terrorism.
But like so many challenges the world faces - it's simply nowhere near as straightforward as it seems.

The FBI has ordered the tech giant to assist it with unlocking an iPhone used by San Bernadino gunman Syed Farook.
Prince Al Hussein said the law enforcement agency ""deserves everyone's full support"" in its investigation.
However, encryption was essential in the interests of freedom, he added.
""There are many ways to investigate whether or not these killers had accomplices besides forcing Apple to create software to undermine the security features of their own phones,"" he said in a statement.
""It is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers.
""Encryption and anonymity are needed as enablers of both freedom of expression and opinion, and the right to privacy. Without encryption tools, lives may be endangered.""
Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people and left 22 injured when they opened fire at his place of work in California in December 2015.
The FBI has asked Apple to disable a feature that means the data on an iPhone is erased after 10 incorrect attempts at the four-digit password. It also wants to be able to run software that could go through the 10,000 possible combinations to unlock the gunman's handset quickly.
Apple says agreeing to the request would set ""a dangerous precedent"".
A number of major tech firms have also pledged their support for Apple's refusal to circumvent its own security.
Two groups of tech giants have now filed an amicus brief, which allows parties not directly involved in a court case, but who feel they are affected by it, to give their view.
They include Twitter, AirBnB, eBay, LinkedIn, Reddit, Amazon, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo.
However, a lawyer representing a group of Farook's surviving victims said he would file similar legal paperwork on their behalf in support of the FBI.
""They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen,"" said Stephen Larson, a former judge.
He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee.",Yes
769,58,encryption,Millions at risk from 'Freak' encryption bug,6 March 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31765672,"Microsoft has issued a security warning about a bug that could let attackers spy on supposedly secure communications.
Called ""Freak"", the bug was found in software used to encrypt data passing between web servers and web users.
Initially the flaw was thought only to affect some users of Android and Blackberry phones and Apple's Safari web browser.
Microsoft's warning suggests millions more may be at risk of losing data.
The Freak flaw was discovered by encryption and security expert Karthikeyan Bhargavan and lets attackers force data travelling between a vulnerable site and a visitor to use weak encryption. This makes it easier to crack open the data and steal sensitive information.
Statistics gathered by a group set up to monitor the impact of the Freak flaw suggest about 9.5% of the web's top one million websites are susceptible to such attacks.
The monitoring group has also produced an online tool that lets people check if they are using a browser that is vulnerable to the flaw.
Apple is expected to produce a patch for the flaw next week and Google has updated its version of Chrome for the Mac to remove its susceptibility to Freak. It has yet to say what action it is taking with Android.
In a security advisory note released on 5 March, Microsoft said every current version of Windows that uses Internet Explorer, or any non-Microsoft software that calls on a part of Windows called Secure Channel, was vulnerable to the Freak flaw.
Microsoft has issued advice about ways to remove the vulnerability from some of its software but said applying these fixes could cause ""serious problems"" with other programs. It said it was working on a separate security update to remove the vulnerability.
In its advisory, Microsoft said it had not received any information that suggested the attack was being actively exploited by cybercriminals.",Yes
770,59,encryption,Yahoo executive challenges NSA over encryption demands,24 February 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31604503,"A Yahoo executive has publicly challenged the National Security Agency (NSA) over encryption ""backdoors"".
Alex Stamos pressed NSA director Adm Mike Rogers on whether the access to encrypted data requested by the US authorities should also be granted to the Russian and Chinese governments.
Adm Rogers insisted an agreement could be reached ""within a framework"".
The tense exchange came after many top tech figures refused to attend a White House cybersecurity summit this month.
""If we're going to build defects, backdoors or golden master keys for the US government, do you believe we should do so... for the Chinese government, the Russian government, the Saudi Arabian government, the Israeli government, the French government?"" asked Mr Stamos, Yahoo's chief information security officer.
After initially dodging the question, Adm Rogers - who took over as director of the NSA last year - responded: ""I think that we're lying that this isn't technically feasible.
""Now, it needs to be done within a framework. I'm the first to acknowledge that.""
According to a transcript provided by the Just Security website, he argued that he did not want the FBI and NSA to unilaterally decide what access they should have, but insisted an agreement was achievable.
Pressed on whether he thought that access should also be granted to other nations' governments, Adm Rogers said: ""I think we can work our way through this.""
Mr Stamos responded: ""I'm sure the Chinese and Russians are going to have the same opinion.""
The exchange took place before delegates at a cybersecurity conference hosted by the New America Foundation on Monday.
There has been an increasingly tense relationship between the US authorities and Silicon Valley since information was leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.
Encryption of user data has subsequently become increasingly popular and, in some cases, the companies hand over the keys to users, making it difficult to break.
But the White House has asked tech firms to share more data with law enforcement agencies. And the US authorities want them to build in vulnerabilities that they would be able to exploit.
The rift was illustrated when, earlier this month, senior Google, Yahoo and Facebook executives turned down invitations to a White House cybersecurity summit at Stanford University.
Tim Cook, of Apple, was one of the few top tech bosses to appear.
Adm Rogers told the conference on Monday that the NSA needed a way to access data if it was believed that a device was ""being used for criminal, or in my case, foreign intelligence or national security issues"".
But he acknowledged that there were legitimate concerns to be addressed before a ""legal framework"" could be established.",Yes

Without anonymising tools, many people will find it far harder to express opinions without censure, it says.
Any attempt to weaken encryption software will only curb this ability, it warns.
The report comes as many governments seek to put ""backdoors"" in encryption software to aid law enforcement.
""Encryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief,"" says the report written by David Kaye, a special rapporteur in the UN's office of the high commissioner for human rights.
The tools to bestow such protection are essential, it says, given the ""unprecedented capacity"" governments, companies, thieves and pranksters now have to interfere with people's ability to express themselves.
Lacking such tools, it adds, many people will be unable to fully explore ""basic aspects of their identity"" such as their gender, religion, ethnicity, origins or sexuality.
The software acts as a ""shield"" for opinions against external scrutiny - a fact that is ""particularly important in hostile political, social, religious and legal environments"", says the report.
""States should not restrict encryption and anonymity, which facilitate and often enable the rights to freedom of opinion and expression.""
The report acknowledges the need for police forces and other agencies to get at encrypted messages and other communications - but says this should be done on a ""case-by-case"" basis and should not be applied to a ""mass of people"".
It also cautions against the use of backdoors and weak encryption systems that can put anonymity in peril as much as they aid law enforcement.
The report is being released against a background of calls from the US and UK governments to hobble encryption - so intelligence agencies and others have access to scrambled communications to help tackle crime and terrorism.

772,61,encryption,The government's data law - an attack on encryption?,27 May 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32900604,"Overdue modernisation of the way the authorities monitor criminals and terrorists - or a Snooper's Charter eroding our basic liberties? The proposal outlined in the Queen's Speech to ""modernise the law on communications data"" will divide opinion. But prepare for another long battle over the way that law is framed and the balance it strikes between privacy and public safety.
The row over forcing internet service providers (ISPs) to hold on to far more data about their users' online activities has stretched over three parliaments. The idea first came up under the last Labour government, when it was quashed by Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition. Then it was resurrected by the Coalition, with Theresa May's plans - immediately dubbed the Snooper's Charter - blocked by her Liberal Democrat partners.
Now we have in the Queen's Speech what looks like a much wider proposal for a new Investigatory Powers Bill. The government says this will ""provide the police and intelligence agencies with the tools to keep you and your family safe"", will ""maintain the ability of our intelligence agencies to target the online communications of terrorists"", and will ""cover all investigatory powers including communications data, where the government has long maintained that the gap in capabilities are putting lives at risk"".
So it is both sweeping and vague, promising to give the authorities the tools they need to track criminals in a complex online world without specifying as yet how far they will be allowed to go.
The Open Rights Group (ORG), which campaigns against increased surveillance, is convinced this is the return of the so-called Snooper's Charter, with increased powers of data collection and retention aimed at the entire population, coupled with attacks on encryption.
The ORG's executive director Jim Killock thinks the bill will have two aims - codifying existing practices by the intelligence agencies uncovered by Edward Snowden and expanding data retention by ISPs.
But he believes that the increasing use of encryption by the likes of Google and Facebook means that ordering ISPs to store their customers' data won't be enough: ""There's going to be a very interesting discussion about whether government can break encryption or order companies to break it.""
Those at the sharp end - the ISPs - are more circumspect in their response to the government's plans. Their trade body ISPA put out a statement welcoming the fact that the government had promised to factor in the independent Anderson review of the laws on intercepting communications data. But it warned of the need to ""properly balance security, privacy, costs to industry and to preserve the UK's reputation as a leading place to do business online"".  The ISPs also suspect that plans to attack encryption could be on the agenda.
The government has a clear election mandate, and is under pressure from the police and intelligence agencies to give them more capabilities in their online battles. But the opposition to its plans - if they do involve cracking the codes that keep online communication secret - will be intense. And it is likely to come not so much from opposition politicians, but from the global technology giants.",Yes
773,62,encryption,LogJam encryption flaw fix will block some websites,20 May 2015,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32814309,"Web-browser makers are preparing a fix for a flaw in an encryption algorithm that makes it possible to spy on supposedly secure communications.
However, the updates will mean a minority of websites will be blocked by the new software.
The ""LogJam attack"" was discovered by researchers at Microsoft and a number of US and French universities.
They believe about 8% of the top one million HTTPS security-protected sites are made vulnerable by the flaw.
Users would therefore be given false reassurance by the padlock icon that such sites display in a browser's address bar.
Some email servers and services that use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocol are also at risk of being hacked until their operators update their systems.
The LogJam attack vulnerability is a legacy of the US 1990s-era export restrictions on cryptographic tools.
These limited the complexity of the secret encryption codes that could be generated by ""international versions"" of US-made software, including Netscape's web browser.
The export rules were later relaxed, but the researchers say an unintended consequence is that a commonly used process, called a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, can be compromised by a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack.
A Diffie-Hellman key exchange was one of the first techniques developed to allow two or more parties to create and share an encryption key by exchanging parts of the key in public.
What the researchers discovered was that by intercepting the communications, a hacker could ensure a 512-bit key was used rather than a more complicated one.
In this context, 512-bit means there are two to the power of 512 possible combinations - representing a huge number.
Nevertheless, the researchers said it was still possible for computers to crack such codes in ""minutes"".
Even more complicated types of encryption were susceptible to cyber-spies using supercomputers at the National Security Agency, they added.
""In the 1024-bit case, we estimate that such computations are plausible given nation-state resources, and a close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency's attacks on VPNs [virtual private networks] are consistent with having achieved such a break,"" they wrote.
Nevertheless, the fix that web-browser makers have agreed on is that their software should block 512-bit or weaker encryption keys.
""The solution is relatively simple - you disable this legacy function on your system,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.
""Unfortunately, some older web servers might then be prevented from starting a secure conversation with the updated web browsers as they would support only that older, shorter, weaker key lengths.
""But do you really want this backward compatibility if it means others could be forced to use this weaker form of encryption?
""Browsers can be updated and servers can be reconfigured easily, and it really is no bad thing to force this to happen bearing in mind the alternative is that a 'secure connection"" could potentially be broken by an eavesdropper.""
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, it has been estimated that 20,000 websites could become blocked as a consequence.
Mozilla - which is responsible for the Firefox browser - said its new software should be released in the ""next few days"".
""Most of the coordination in this case was done thanks to the researchers who found the bug. They provided valuable measurement data to the various browser vendors, which allowed us all to calibrate our response,"" said Richard Barnes, the organisation's cryptographic engineering manager.
Another security expert said that internet users should not be worried about being unprotected in the meantime.
""The fact that LogJam can only be exploited when hackers and targets are on the same network, as well as patches being imminent, means that hype around it is likely to be a bit of a storm in a teacup,"" said Ross Brewer, from security research company LogRhythm.
""Organisations should, however, use flaws like this as an excuse to give themselves a security health check.
""With flaws like LogJam being identified with increasing frequency, the only real way to know you're safe is to know you can stop an attack in its tracks as soon as it gets going.""",Yes
774,63,encryption,2014: The year of encryption,10 January 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25670315,"""The solution to government surveillance is to encrypt everything.""
So said Eric Schmidt, Google's chairman, in response to revelations about the activities of the US National Security Agency (NSA) made by whistle-blower Edward Snowden.
Schmidt's advice appears to have been heeded by companies that provide internet-based services.
Microsoft, for instance, says it will have ""best-in-class industry cryptography"" in place for services including Outlook.com, Office 365 and SkyDrive by the end of the year, while Yahoo has announced plans to encrypt all of its customers' data, including emails, by the end of the first quarter of 2014.
For many smaller businesses too, 2014 is likely to be the year of encryption. That's certainly the view of Dave Frymier, chief information security officer at Unisys, a Pennsylvania-based IT company.
But he believes the driving force for this will be different: not government surveillance programmes, but the threat of attacks from hackers.
Rather than encrypting everything, Mr Frymier advocates that companies identify what he believes is the 5%-15% of their data that is really confidential, and use encryption to protect just that.
He says employees should then be barred from accessing this data using standard desktop and laptop machines or their own smartphones or tablets, which can easily be infected with malware. Access would be restricted to employees using secure ""hardened"" computers.
""When you look at the increasing sophistication of malware, it becomes apparent that you need to establish highly protected enclaves of data. The only way to achieve that is through modern encryption, properly implemented,"" says Mr Frymier.
""You can split your data into diamonds and paperclips, and the important thing is to encrypt the diamonds, and not to sweat the paperclips.""
Prakash Panjwani, a general manager at Maryland-based data protection company Safenet, also believes that the large number of high-profile data breaches in 2013 - including hacker attacks on US retailer Target, software maker Adobe, and photo messaging service Snapchat - means that 2014 will inevitably be a bumper one for encryption vendors.
""Snowden has focused attention on surveillance issues, but the real threat is organised crime and the number of data breaches that are occurring,"" he says.
""Companies are going to come under extreme pressure from boards, customers and regulators in 2014 to take action so that if there is a data breach they can say, 'We didn't lose any data because it was encrypted.'""
A large number of companies already use encryption to protect the data they store on their own systems ""at rest"", as well as data ""in flight"" as it is sent over networks to customers, other data centres, or for processing or storage in the cloud.
But Ramon Krikken, an analyst at Gartner, believes that the way encryption is used by many of these companies is likely to change in 2014.
""Companies are certainly going to have to take encryption more seriously thanks to the Snowden revelations,"" he says.
""At the moment many companies are using encryption for compliance reasons, not for security. They are not using it to protect their data, but because it is the easiest way to comply with regulations: encryption is the auditor's and the regulator's favourite check box item.""
One question that companies will need to consider is which encryption algorithm or cipher to use to best encrypt their data. It's an important question as some older ciphers can now be ""cracked"" relatively quickly using the computing power in a standard desktop PC.
And there is a question mark over whether the NSA may have deliberately used its influence to weaken some encryption systems - or even to introduce ""back doors"" that provide easy access to encrypted data to anyone who knows of their existence.
""The problem is that even if you can inspect the source code, it is certainly not a given that you would be able to spot a back door,"" Mr Krikken says.
He believes it is more important to establish where all the parts of an encryption solution come from.
""If you procure software or hardware from overseas, from a country with a government which does not have your best interests at heart, you need to remember that it may not be as secure as you think,"" Mr Krikken says.
""So you have to decide who you trust, and find out where the vendor gets all the parts of its product from.""
Another thing companies need to consider when they implement encryption is how strong the encryption should be. Using a longer encryption key makes it harder for hackers or governments to crack the encryption, but it also requires more computing power.
But Robert Former, senior security consultant for Neohapsis, an Illinois-based security services company, says many companies are overestimating the computational complexity of encryption.
""If you have an Apple Mac, your processor spends far more time making OS X looks pretty than it does doing crypto work.""
He therefore recommends using encryption keys that are two or even four times longer than the ones many companies are currently using.
""I say use the strongest cryptography that your hardware and software can support. I guarantee you that the cost of using your available processing power is less than the cost of losing your data because you were too cheap to make the crypto strong enough,"" he says.
""No-one ever got fired for having encryption that was too strong.""",Yes
775,64,encryption,FBI boss 'concerned' by smartphone encryption plans,26 September 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29378172,"Plans by Apple and Google to do more to protect customers' privacy have made the FBI ""very concerned"".
Speaking to reporters, FBI boss James Comey said the plans to enable encryption by default could thwart law enforcement investigations.
Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said.
The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey.
The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said.
""I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'"" said Mr Comey in a briefing.
His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices.
Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android.
Mr Comey said he was ""very concerned"" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do.
""What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law,"" he said.
""I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law,"" he added.
Apple and Google have yet to respond to Mr Comey's comments.
Ten days prior to Mr Comey's press statement, iOS data forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski pointed out that Apple's encryption system would not stop police getting at data on portable devices.
Specifically weakening security systems just to aid the police was a bad decision, he said.
""For the sake of privacy and overall security, the only logical solution is to make products as secure as possible, and let good detective work do the crime solving, rather than an easy button,"" he wrote in a blogpost.",Yes
776,65,encryption,Google and Apple to introduce default encryption,19 September 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29276955,"Google has announced that its next mobile operating system, Android L, will encrypt users' data by default.
The measure will make it more difficult for private information to be hacked or handed to law enforcement agencies.
On Thursday, Apple said that devices running its new iOS8 software would be encrypted by default, with even the company itself unable to gain access.
Both firms have offered encryption for some time, but many users were unaware of its existence or had not enabled it.
Earlier this week, Apple's boss Tim Cook posted an online message assuring users the company's philosophy was that a ""great customer experience shouldn't come at the expense of your privacy"".
As well as announcing default encryption for all devices running the new iOS8 software, Mr Cook took a thinly veiled swipe at Google, saying that Apple would not use its customers' information to sell things to them.
""We don't 'monetise' the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud,"" he wrote, ""and we don't read your email or your messages to get information to market to you.""
He added that although Apple does have an advertising business, called iAd, the function can be disabled by users.
Shortly after, Google announced its stance on privacy, also embracing default encryption. A spokesman said: ""For over three years, Android has offered encryption, and keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement.
""As part of our next Android release, encryption will be enabled by default out of the box, so you won't even have to think about turning it on.""
Both Apple and Google follow in the footsteps of the now somewhat beleaguered Blackberry, which has encrypted data by default for some time.
The firms' focus on privacy comes after nude photos of celebrities were leaked online earlier this month.
The breach, which affected actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, was linked by some security experts to vulnerabilities in Apple's iCloud storage service.
The introduction of default encryption also protects US firms from having to hand over data to law enforcement agencies.
As the companies themselves do not have access to users' passwords, which unlock the encryption, they are not actually in possession of the data concerned.
Several of the largest US tech firms have been fighting government requests for their users' private data, including Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox.
David Emm, a senior researcher at security firm Kaspersky Lab, told the BBC that automatic encryption was ""probably more about privacy than about protection"".
""Customers will find some reassurance in the fact that their data can't routinely fall into third-party hands,"" he said.
However he added that the measure only ""applies to stuff on a [Apple or Android] device, but not necessarily to stuff you put in the cloud, which could still be accessible to law enforcement agencies"".",Yes
777,66,encryption,Do quantum computers threaten global encryption systems?,12 August 2014,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27974877,"The modern world is a house of cards built upon encryption.
Make a mobile phone call and encryption is there to stop eavesdroppers listening in.
Spend money online and encryption ensures your card number and identity cannot be scooped up and used elsewhere.
And the money that keeps global banking systems lubricated only does so thanks to cryptographic software that turns a stream of data into unintelligible nonsense.
Remove all that encryption and the whole lot comes tumbling down.
If that happens we might return to an era when commerce was mostly done face-to-face and based around who you know.
Yet quantum computers - another modern marvel - are threatening to make this doomsday scenario a reality.
Why?
""Because of the possibilities for massive parallelism,"" says Prof Mark Manulis, a cryptographic expert from the University of Surrey's department of computing.
In other words, because of a quantum computer's potential ability to do trillions of calculations a second.
When a message is scrambled with a modern encryption system, the keys used to lock it are typically very large numbers - tens, if not hundreds, of digits long.
Finding that key means using a computer to carry out lots of sums and then trying each answer to see if it unlocks a message an attacker is interested in.
The sheer number of possible answers lends protection because it would take centuries, or longer, to find the right key.
Unless large-scale quantum computers are commonplace, says Prof Manulis.
Quantum computers can crank through those sums so fast because their basic building blocks, known as qubits, can be used to represent both a zero and a one at the same time.
By contrast the computational elements, bits, of the classical computers under our desks and on our laps represent either a zero or a one. Not both.
The curious properties of the quantum realm mean that when those qubits work together you get a vast rise in computational power - hence the potential they have to speed things up, find keys and crack codes.
Most significantly affected by the arrival of quantum computers are the public key infrastructure (PKI) systems we use to establish secure channels of communication online.
Typically, when you turn up at a website it is PKI that sets up the initial connection. With that secure channel created, different encryption systems that are much less susceptible to attack by quantum computers are used to protect data shuttling back and forth.
""Public key cryptography is based on problems from number theory, integer factorisation and discrete logarithms, that will be broken once we have powerful quantum computers,"" said Prof Manulis.
The key word here is ""once"".
But that once might be a long time coming, believes Dr Stephan Ritter, who studies quantum computers at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany.
""Quantum computers are not very powerful at the moment but they have this potential, and that's what this is about,"" he told the BBC.
""Experimentally I would say that we are at the stage where it's not even clear which physical elements they will be made of.""
Researchers have yet to agree on the best way to build these qubits and how to link them together. So far, Dr Ritter says, only quantum computers with a small handful of qubits have been made - a long way from the hundreds and thousands needed to make it able to do useful work and do it quickly.
""There are proofs of concept of these building blocks but they all have advantages or disadvantages, so it's unclear which will be the best as we go forward,"" he says.
Despite what Dr Ritter sees as a lack of progress, Canadian firm D-Wave will sell you a working quantum computer if you have $15m (Â£8.9m) to spare.
The way it operates is controversial and its price suggests it will not be the widely available device that can crack all our codes.
Even when they are available, says Dr Ritter, we should not think of them as wonder machines that speed up any and every batch processing job or database search.
Purest-ever silicon in quantum fix
""They are good for very specific tasks,"" he says, ""but not everything is faster with a quantum computer and there will be many tasks you will not use one for at all.""
As a result we should have a few years yet to update and improve our encryption systems as research and development work on quantum computers continues.
That's just as well, says Dr Tanja Lange, a coding theory and cryptology expert from the Technical University of Eindhoven, as it can take a long time for older encryption systems to be swapped out in favour of more secure alternatives.
For instance, she says, it took five to six years to swap out the widely used MD5 data scrambling system once its weakness was demonstrated through a viable attack. Timescales can stretch for systems already used widely in the field, such as those found in cash machines, smart cards and mobile phones.
""However, if a system is absolutely badly broken, roll-out can be faster,"" she says. ""RSA sent new tokens promptly after they had a break-in and credit card companies are used to replacing cards if there is a risk that they were compromised.""
What will be harder, she says, is migrating everyone to the software systems that can resist attack by quantum computer. At the very least such systems require much bigger encryption keys and that means they are much less efficient - for which read, slower.
""We hope that with another three to five years of research we can design systems that are smaller, but we're not there yet,"" she says.
""Currently we can give you a tank with concrete enforcement - it's secure but big.
""We hope to find a way to give you a secure sports car with airbags, ABS and all that neatly hidden away in a sleek design.""",Yes

781,70,encryption,How the modern world depends on encryption,25 October 2013,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24667834,"Encryption makes the modern world go round. Every time you make a mobile phone call, buy something with a credit card in a shop or on the web, or even get cash from an ATM, encryption bestows upon that transaction the confidentiality and security to make it possible.
""If you consider electronic transactions and online payments, all those would not be possible without encryption,"" said Dr Mark Manulis, a senior lecturer in cryptography at the University of Surrey.
At its simplest encryption is all about transforming intelligible numbers or text, sounds and images into a stream of nonsense.
There are many, many ways to perform that transformation, some straightforward and some very complex. Most involve swapping letters for numbers and use maths to do the transformation. However, no matter which method is used the resulting scrambled data stream should give no hints about how it was encrypted.
During World War II, the Allies scored some notable victories against the Germans because their encryption systems did not sufficiently scramble messages. Rigorous mathematical analysis by Allied code crackers laid bare patterns hidden within the messages and used them to recreate the machine used to encrypt them.
Those codes revolved around the use of secret keys that were shared among those who needed to communicate securely. These are known as symmetric encryption systems and have a weakness in that everyone involved has to possess the same set of secret keys.
In the modern era, a need has arisen to communicate securely with people and organisations we do not know and with whom we cannot easily share secret keys, said Dr Manulis. This need has given rise to public-key cryptography. Despite the formidable name it encapsulates a simple idea.
Essentially, it allows anyone to send a message that only one person (or company or website or gadget) can unlock. It does this using two keys: one public, one private. The public key is used to lock a message. Anyone can get hold of that public key but once a message is locked with it, that message can only be opened with the corresponding private key.
Typically these keys are large numbers and the security of the system depends on the fact that some mathematical operations are easier than others.
For instance, it is far easier to multiply numbers together (public key and plain text message) to get a result than it is to start with that result (the scrambled message) and work backwards. Complicated mathematics guarantees that the right private key will unscramble a message.
Far harder, even for the fastest computer, is starting with that result (the scrambled message) and searching through all the possible combinations of numbers that could produce it.
""Because of the size of the keys is so huge its impossible for an attacker to search through the key space with the resources they usually have,"" he said. Such ""brute force"" attacks are pretty much doomed no matter how much computer power attackers bring to bear, he said
Typically the numbers used in these mathematical encryption systems are tens if not hundreds of digits long. This makes it impossible, to all intents and purposes, to search through all potential keys in a reasonable amount of time.
The web and many other modern communication systems employ a hybrid approach, said Dr Manulis, because public key encryption is not very computationally efficient compared to symmetric key encryption.
On the web, the relatively slower public key cryptography is used initially to establish a secure connection between you and a website. The symmetric system would be no good for this step because there is no way to securely swap the secret key.
However, with a secure channel in place, the faster symmetric system can be used to share a key and then scramble the data passing back and forth.
On mobiles, a similar system is used and encryption keys are held on a handset's sim card to help keep chatter scrambled.
Attacks on these encryption systems take many forms, said Dr Manulis.
""You do not need to break the communication system if you have some spy software on the end point,"" he said.
In addition, weaknesses have been found in the software used to encapsulate them on computers and phones.
""The algorithms are mathematically proven,"" he said, "" and if there's any problem then it usually comes in the implementation of the algorithm.""
In addition, there have been suggestions that the NSA has subverted the process of creating encryption algorithms, to make them easier for it to break.
Official agencies can also force firms, be they websites or mobile operators, to surrender their private keys so they can eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications.
Some have sought to get make encryption more secure by using a technique known as end-to-end encryption.
This differs from more standard systems which can be vulnerable because their scrambling system is, in software terms, separate from the program used to create a message.
If attackers insert themselves between the message making software and the encryption system at either end of a conversation they will see information before it is scrambled.
End-to-end encryption closes this gap by having the message making software apply the scrambling directly. In addition, many of these systems run a closed network so messages never travel over the public internet and are only decrypted when they reach their intended recipient.",Yes

In an advisory note to its developer customers, RSA said that a community-developed algorithm in one of its toolkits could contain a vulnerability.
It ""strongly recommends"" switching to other random number generators instead.
The warning came from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology.
The advice comes in the wake of New York Times allegations that the NSA may have intentionally introduced a flaw into the algorithm - known as Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation - and then tried to get it adopted as a security standard by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology.
In the 1990s, the NSA tried to claim the right to unlock all encryption systems, but lost the battle after privacy rights and freedom of speech advocates objected.
The NSA maintains that it needs to be able to decipher encrypted communications to protect the US against terrorism and organised crime.
As the documents leaked by the former government security contractor Edward Snowden have demonstrated, the NSA has been intercepting communications data from all over the world through its Prism surveillance programme.
But it is locked in a continuous battle with cryptographers who are developing increasingly sophisticated security systems.
One of the NSA's tactics has been to persuade leading technology companies, such as Microsoft and Google, to co-operate with the security services in providing access to user data. Privacy rights campaigners have been concerned over how far this co-operation may extend.
Under US law, service providers have to hand over user data to the NSA but are not allowed to publish how many security-related data requests they receive.
A growing number of providers are beginning to stand up to the government and demand more transparency.
For example, the Digital Due Process Coalition, which is calling for reform of the 1986 US Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), includes companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Linkedin and Microsoft.
The coalition argues that the ECPA has been outpaced by the rapid rise of the internet and the explosion of digital data.",Yes

Disclosures by leaker Edward Snowden allege the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK's GCHQ successfully decoded key online security protocols.
They suggest some internet companies provided the agencies backdoor access to their security systems.
The NSA is said to spend $250m (Â£160m) a year on the top-secret operation.
It is codenamed Bullrun, an American civil-war battle, according to the documents published by the Guardian in conjunction with the New York Times and ProPublica.
The British counterpart scheme run by GCHQ is called Edgehill, after the first major engagement of the English civil war, say the documents.
The reports say the UK and US intelligence agencies are focusing on the encryption used in 4G smartphones, email, online shopping and remote business communication networks.
The encryption techniques are used by internet services such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo.
Under Bullrun, it is said that the NSA has built powerful supercomputers to try to crack the technology that scrambles and encrypts personal information when internet users log on to access various services.
The NSA also collaborated with unnamed technology companies to build so-called back doors into their software - something that would give the government access to information before it is encrypted and sent over the internet, it is reported.
As well as supercomputers, methods used include ""technical trickery, court orders and behind-the-scenes persuasion to undermine the major tools protecting the privacy of everyday communications"", the New York Times reports.
The US reportedly began investing billions of dollars in the operation in 2000 after its initial efforts to install a ""back door"" in all encryption systems were thwarted.
During the next decade, it is said the NSA employed code-breaking computers and began collaborating with technology companies at home and abroad to build entry points into their products.
The documents provided to the Guardian by Mr Snowden do not specify which companies participated.
The NSA also hacked into computers to capture messages prior to encryption, and used broad influence to introduce weaknesses into encryption standards followed by software developers the world over, the New York Times reports.
When British analysts were first told of the extent of the scheme they were ""gobsmacked"", according to one memo among more than 50,000 documents shared by the Guardian.
NSA officials continue to defend the agency's actions, claiming it will put the US at considerable risk if messages from terrorists and spies cannot be deciphered.
But some experts argue that such efforts could actually undermine national security, noting that any back doors inserted into encryption programs can be exploited by those outside the government.
It is the latest in a series of intelligence leaks by Mr Snowden, a former NSA contractor, who began providing caches of sensitive government documents to media outlets three months ago.
In June, the 30-year-old fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked at a small NSA installation, to Hong Kong, and subsequently to Russia after making revelations about a secret US data-gathering programme.

There are two major players in the market and the most popular, with over a billion users, is WeChat.
Created in 2011 by Chinese tech giant Tencent, WeChat started life as a messaging platform.
It is now estimated to offer more than one million services through mini programmes, which are apps created by third-party companies and accessible through WeChat.

They don't advertise through traditional channels or social media yet business is booming, with tens of thousands of dollars worth of orders rolling in every month.
China leapfrogged into the internet era, which means people went from telephones to smartphones pretty quickly.
This allowed internet companies to innovate in a way their counterparts in the West haven't been able to.
Rui Ma, who co-hosts the podcast Techbuzz, tells me it's also because data laws in China are quite different.
""In the West we have a lot of rules and regulations, creating a lot of friction around these services that in China the government simply hasn't gotten around to regulating,"" she says.
That's not the only reason.
""Chinese internet companies think of building entire ecosystems, versus product-first or product-centric companies,"" she says.
""They're not just building a feature or one service. They're thinking about how to take the user's entire lifestyle and move it online.""
A life lived online means a lot of transactions and a lot of data.
Under Chinese law, all companies - not just WeChat - can be compelled to hand over that data to the ruling Communist Party.
The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) says it has found evidence of censorship on WeChat in China and warns this could also happen to overseas users.
""The risks associated with WeChat's lack of end-to-end encryption is that Tencent and WeChat can have access to any of your data on WeChat,"" says Audrey Fritz, who co-authored an ASPI report looking at the Communist Party's influence on Chinese internet firms.
""[They are] bound by [China's] cyber-security laws to give any data on WeChat or any of their apps to the government, if the Communist Party should request that.""
Tencent told the BBC it complies with the laws and regulations of each market it operates in, adding that user privacy and data security are core values.
""User privacy and data security are core values at Tencent. We hold ourselves to the highest standards in protecting our users while ensuring we comply with all laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate,"" the company said.
Concern over privacy and data security could be among the reasons it has been difficult for these Chinese apps to expand overseas.
Throw in the fact that the domestic market in China is so big, there's really no need to go anywhere else.
The race to build the world's next super-app is revving up and many of the frontrunners are based in South East Asia.
With 600 million people spread across the region, there are already half a dozen companies vying for their attention.
Grab, Gojek and the SEA Group are among the biggest and best funded.
Chinese companies Alibaba and Tencent have invested in them, as have US firms including Facebook, Google and PayPal.
Indonesian-based Gojek has grown from a motorcycle-hailing platform to an app offering car rides, payments and food delivery.
Gojek co-chief executive Kevin Aluwi says the region is a natural fit for super-apps.
""Having to only download one single app is something that is probably uniquely appealing to a part of the world where, for most people, the first real experience of the internet happened on mobile.""
Perhaps surprisingly for a company that calls itself a super-app, Mr Aluwi says Gojek isn't trying to monopolise its users' time.
""Many super-apps view their objective as to increase the amount of time that customers are actually viewing their app,"" he says.
""For us, we want our customers to get in, find the thing they need to solve their problem at that moment and then get out and get on with their lives.""",Yes
788,77,encryption,Smart doorbells 'easy target for hackers' study finds,23 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55044568,"Major security flaws in popular smart doorbells are putting consumers at risk of being targeted by hackers inside their homes, according to Which.
The consumer group says devices being sold on marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, could easily be  hacked or switched off by criminals.
It is asking the government for new legislation to safeguard consumers.
Amazon has removed at least seven product listings in response to the findings.
The watchdog tested 11 devices which were purchased from popular online marketplaces in the UK. Brands included Qihoo, Ctronics and Victure.
It found that among the most common flaws were weak password policies, and a lack of data encryption.
Two of the devices in the test could be manipulated to steal network passwords and then hack other smart devices within the home.
Amazon UK's current number one bestseller in smart doorbells, the Victure Smart Video Doorbell, was found to send users' home network names and passwords unencrypted to servers in China.
The BBC has asked Victure for comment.
Lisa Forte, a partner at Red Goat Cyber Security, which specialises in cyber-security testing, said consumers may inadvertently be putting convenience before security.
""Generally speaking the more convenient something is, the less secure it is,"" she told the BBC.
""The more connected devices you have in your home, the more 'doors' there are for cyber-criminals to open. This investigation highlights how many brands arenât putting the security of their customers first.
""If you have decided to purchase a smart doorbell, make sure it is from a well-known, trusted brand. When you set it up change the default password to something long, and if possible enable two-factor authentication in the set-up,"" she added.
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is when a secondary step is introduced to the log-in process, such as a code sent as an email or text.
While Amazon removed several products from sale, eBay told Which? that none of the findings violated its own safety standards.
A spokesman for the marketplace said the flaws represented ""technical product issues that should be addressed with the seller or manufacturer"".
Kate Bevan, Which? Computing editor, said better regulation was needed.
""Government legislation to tackle unsecure products should be introduced without delay and must be backed by an enforcement body with teeth that is able to crack down on these devices.""",Yes
789,78,encryption,Operation Venetic: Man in court charged with drugs offences,2 March 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-56243766,"A 33-year-old man from south Armagh has appeared in court in Newry charged in connection with the supply of Class A and Class B drugs.
William John Hewitt, of Lower Foughill Road in Jonesborough, is also accused of being involved in an arrangement to acquire criminal property and conspiring to import cannabis.
The charges follow a National Crime Agency-led operation in the Newry area on Monday as part of Operation Venetic.
Thirteen classic cars were also seized.
Prosecution barrister Robin Steer said the investigation follows police obtaining encrypted data on encrypted handsets last year.
The court heard that the handsets cost in the region of Â£1,200 to Â£1,500 each.
The prosecution said evidence secured from the breaking of the encrypted network indicated Mr Hewitt is ""involved in drug dealing at a very high level and part of a network"".
The classic cars were seized by police during a series of searches.
A notebook was also found behind a microwave in Mr Hewitt's home which the prosecution said contains terminology, including slang terms for drugs, for use on encrypted calls.
Sums of money totalling around Â£2m were also recorded in the book.
The court heard that to date around 25 people have been charged in relation to Operation Venetic which began in July 2020.
The vast majority of these people have subsequently been granted bail.
However, the prosecution objected to Mr Hewitt being granted bail ""at this early stage"".
They said this was in relation to concerns that he could frustrate the investigation or flee across the Irish border.
Mr Hewitt's defence solicitor said the latter was not a realistic objection as, ""practically everyone in Northern Ireland lives within an hour of the border"" and that ""it was well reported that the encrypted network had been cracked last year and there was no suggestion he has tried to abscond since"".
In relation to the issue of frustrating the investigation, the defence solicitor said that the court could put reporting requirements on the defendant, that they could tag him, place him under a curfew and freeze his assets.
However, Deputy District Judge Phillip Mateer refused bail, stating: ""I'm not satisfied the conditions would give the court confidence that he wouldn't abscond. As the prosecution has said, it is still at an early stage and the concern is that he may frustrate the police investigation by dealing with assets that are not yet known.""
Mr Hewitt was remanded into custody and will appear in court again on 24 March.",Yes
790,79,encryption,Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks?,8 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419,"Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks.
Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.
Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware.
However, the new report comes on the back of a recent significant security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system.
And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with.
So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried?
Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.
Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers.
This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system.
Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware.
""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.
Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security.
""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot.""
There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as RobbinHood, a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019.
Another example is Thunderspy, an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other.
This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep.
""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.
""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more.""
The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops).
""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC.
Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software, because they only make money if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.
Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws.
The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years.
Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.
Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.
Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds.
""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do.""
Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole, to pay attention to hardware security.
""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.
""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected.""
Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.
""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.
""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""",Yes
791,80,encryption,County Lines 'Manc Joe' drug gang's Anthony Kamara jailed,11 February 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-56031451,"An eighth member of a county lines drugs gang which used teenagers as slaves has been jailed for six years.
Anthony Kamara, 33, was tracked down by police who cracked secret messages the group sent in encrypted messages.
The 'Manc Joe' gang operated from Liverpool and ran hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of heroin and crack cocaine to Exeter during the first seven months of 2020.
Seven other gang members were sentenced at Exeter Crown Court last year.
County lines is where urban drug gangs expand their markets for crack cocaine and heroin into smaller towns and cities.
Kamara, of Ritson Street, Toxteth, Liverpool, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and was jailed for six years by Judge Peter Johnson.
The judge told him: ""You played a highly significant and active part in bringing drugs down and taking money back and running the phones.""
Peter Coombe, for the prosecution, said Kamara's role was only just below that of organiser Connor Wilbraham, 21, from Merseyside, who set up the drugs line while on the run from the police.
Wilbraham was jailed for seven and a half years in December.
In November, five other men aged between 21 and 46 were jailed for between two-and-a-half and four years each.
Lewis Rees, now aged 18, of Woodchurch Estate, Birkenhead, was sentenced to two years, suspended for two years.
Mr Rees was deemed to be a modern slave by the national referral mechanism and charges against a 16-year-old were dropped after he received a similar adjudication.
The gang were caught because their street dealers became highly visible to police during the first lockdown and detectives were able to trace the leaders through the encrypted messages on their phones.
They used the street names of 'Manc Joe' or 'Joey' in an apparent attempt to hide their Merseyside origins.
Peter White, defending Kamara, said he was drawn into the conspiracy after he lost his job with Jaguar Land Rover.",Yes
792,81,encryption,FBI arrest man over alleged Amazon centre bomb plot,12 April 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56719618,"US authorities have arrested a man who allegedly plotted to bomb an Amazon data centre, which he believed would ""kill off about 70% of the internet"".
Seth Aaron Pendley, 28, was arrested after receiving a dud explosive device from an undercover FBI agent, and was charged with a malicious attempt to destroy a building with an explosive,
He came to the FBI's attention after somebody reported his online posts.
If convicted, Mr Pendley could face up to 20 years in prison.
According to investigators, Mr Pendley's main goal was to damage Amazon's web server network.
He believed that there were 24 buildings that ""run 70% of the internet"",  including services used by the CIA and FBI, according to a conversation detailed in the criminal complaint against him.
Damaging them would frustrate the ""oligarchy"" - or small group of elites - in power in the United States, he believed.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) does play a hugely important role in the modern internet, hosting and processing the information behind many popular online services and websites.
Outages caused by a problem at one centre tend to knock services offline for several hours at most, and often for a limited number of people or for specific sites.
For example, in 2017, a major fault at one US AWS centre knocked sites such as Quora and Trello offline for several hours. And even the total loss by fire of a data centre belonging to European company OVH earlier this year - which disrupted an estimated 3.6 million websites including government portals across Europe - went unnoticed by many internet users.
An Amazon spokesperson said: ""We would like to thank the FBI for their work in this investigation. We take the safety and security of our staff and customer data incredibly seriously, and constantly review various vectors for any potential threats. We will continue to retain this vigilance about our employees and customers.""
Mr Pendley attended the Capitol Riots of 6 January, investigators found, having driven from Texas to Washington DC. Investigators said he told friends he had brought an assault rifle with him, but left it in his car - and also that although he reached the windows of the Capitol building, he did not enter it.
Two days after that event, a ""concerned citizen"" reported Mr Pendley's posts on a militia website - where he went by the name of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine - to the FBI.
""We are indebted to the concerned citizen who came forward to report the defendant's alarming online rhetoric. In flagging his posts to the FBI, this individual may have saved the lives of a number of tech workers,"" acting US attorney Prerak Shah said in a statement.
The posts from ""Dionysus"" that sparked concern spoke of his desire to ""conduct a little experiment,"" which he said would be ""dangerous"" and ""draw a lot of heat"". Asked by another user what the result would be, he responded, ""death"", according to the court documents.
The FBI managed to uncover Dionysus's email address, and link that to his Facebook account and real-world identity.
In late January, Mr Pendley began using the encrypted messaging app Signal to detail his plans to bomb an AWS facility - but the recipient of those messages was a confidential FBI informant, investigators said.
Over the course of February, Mr Pendley shared his plans, including the type of explosive he sought, potential targets, and maps.
On 31 March, the confidant introduced Pendley to a supposed explosives supplier - who was actually an undercover member of the FBI. His plan at this point, according to a recorded conversation, was to attack three Amazon buildings clustered close together.
On 8 April, at the handover of the supposed explosives, the undercover FBI employee showed Mr Pendley boxes he claimed were C-4 weapons-grade explosives, and showed him how to arm and detonate them. After Mr Pendley took the devices and placed them in his car, he was arrested by the FBI.
Mr Pendley made an initial court appearance on Friday, and remains in custody.",Yes
793,82,encryption,"Zoom 'unsuitable' for government secrets, researchers say",3 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52152025,"The hugely popular video meetings app Zoom has ""significant weaknesses"" which might make it unsuitable for secrets.
A team at The Citizen Lab found that Zoom was using a non-standard type of encryption, and transmitting information through China.
Government use - such as Boris Johnson's use of the app for Cabinet meetings - may not be wise, the researchers warned.
But the app is fine for keeping in touch for most people, they said.
Until recently, Zoom was used mainly by large businesses for video conference calls. But the explosion in users during the coronavirus pandemic has created ""a new gold rush for cyber-spies"", The Citizen Lab's report said.
It warned that Zoom ""may not be suitable"" for:
But for people using Zoom for contacting friends, holding social events or organising courses or lectures, ""our findings should not necessarily be concerning"", the report said.
By Joe Tidy, Cyber-security Reporter
Zoom says there are now 200 million meetings held on it every day, and despite the serious flaws uncovered in this latest report, it's probably safe to say that 199 million of them are not in danger.
The Citizen Lab has shown compelling evidence here that it is possible to collect all the data of a video meeting and then partially unscramble it to find out, roughly, what was said and what was seen.
However, it would take a huge amount of time and effort for a hacker to achieve this - and it simply wouldn't be worth the effort for an average work huddle or friendly pub quiz held on the service. It's the high-level talks at company board level, or in government, that will be targeted.
The government has been led by the National Cyber Security Centre and other security experts on this since the beginning. The goal has always been to allow for open and smooth communications to take place, but this research may well lead to the advice on Zoom changing fast.
""Zoom has made the classic mistake of designing and implementing their own encryption scheme, rather than using one of the existing standards for encrypting voice and video content,"" said Bill Marczak, a Research Fellow at The Citizen Lab.
""To be sure, Zoom's encryption is better than none at all, but users expecting their Zoom meetings to be safe from espionage should think twice before using the app to discuss sensitive information.""
The research has not taken the security services in the UK by surprise and it is understood that a project is working ""at pace"" to adapt existing communication systems to the demands of home working and security.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a statement saying: ""Zoom is being used to enable unclassified crisis COVID-19 communications in the current unprecedented circumstances. Assured services are in place for more sensitive communications and the provision of these services is being widened given the demands of much greater remote working.""
The government is not disclosing which meetings are eligible for Zoom and which ones are not. As an example, the BBC was told that Zoom is safe for Cabinet-level discussions but not for emergency Cobra meetings.
Aside from the encryption standards, the researchers also found that Zoom sends traffic to China - even when all the people in a Zoom meeting are outside of China.
""During multiple test calls in North America, we observed keys for encrypting and decrypting meetings transmitted to servers in Beijing, China,"" the report said.
The report also pointed to the strong involvement of Chinese firms in the company. Zoom has its headquarters in the US, but has about 700 employees across three companies in mainland China working on the app's development.
""Running development out of China likely saves Zoom having to pay Silicon Valley salaries, reducing their expenses and increasing their profit margin. However, this arrangement could also open up Zoom to pressure from Chinese authorities,"" the report said.
The team said there are mixed and confusing messages around the type of encryption that Zoom actually uses.
In some places, it tells users that it uses ""end-to-end"" encryption - the gold standard for secure messaging, which makes it impossible for the service, or any other middlemen, to access data. In its documentation, Zoom has said it uses a type of encryption called AES-256.
But the researchers said this is not true. Instead, Zoom has ""rolled their own"" encryption - using a variant of something called AES-128 in ""ECB mode"".
Among security researchers, ECB mode ""is well understood to be a bad idea"", because it preserves some of the patterns of the original, the report said.
The report also says that Zoom does not use end-to-end encryption ""as most people understand the term"". Instead, it uses ""transport"" encryption between devices and servers.
""Because Zoom does not implement true end-to-end encryption, they have the theoretical ability to decrypt and monitor Zoom calls,"" the report said. But it noted that Zoom itself has already addressed this concern, promising that they have never built such a mechanism, even if it is theoretically possible.
During their research, the team was able to extract a still image from a video meeting using the encryption key.
Zoom clarified its encryption policy on 1 April, apologising for incorrectly suggesting that meetings were capable of end-to-end encryption.
It also moved to quell fears about privacy and security issues, promising to spend the next 90 days exclusively working on  ""trust, safety, and privacy issues"".
Alan Woodward, a professor of computer science at Surrey University, told the BBC that a major fix is needed.
""I don't believe this is something that Zoom can just add to their list of jobs to do in the next 90 days. It's possible, but this requires a re-engineering of the way they encrypt their calls, so it's a major undertaking.""
Prof Woodward added: ""I would not use Zoom for any sensitive or secret discussions.""",Yes
794,83,encryption,Biden inauguration: What are far-right Trump supporters saying?,16 January 2021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-55679813,"Mass armed protests initially called for by some extreme Trump supporters in the lead-up to inauguration day have so far not materialised, following an apparent change of heart by the groups involved.
One flyer shared on Gab, a Twitter-like platform popular with far-right groups, had called for armed protests in Washington and 50 state capitals ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration. The plans prompted a warning from the FBI.
But in recent days those calls have been reversed and a new theory put forward on fringe platforms - that plans for armed protests were instead a ""trap"" set up by the FBI, or supporters of the left-wing Antifa or Black Lives Matter (BLM) groups.
Some of these discussions have been happening on less popular and less public online platforms, where many Trump supporters from far-right and conspiracy groups have migrated after being kicked off Facebook and Twitter in the wake of the Capitol riots on 6 January.
The vast majority of armed rallies that were initially being promoted have so far not gone ahead following the warnings.
On Sunday, despite earlier fears of violence, there were only a few armed protesters in front of state capitols in several states, including Michigan and Ohio.
Those who did turn out were not dedicated Trump supporters but mainly members of the extreme libertarian Boogaloo Bois movement, whose followers advocate an armed overthrow of government.
Despite a continued belief in unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, many of Mr Trump's supporters seem resigned to the reality that Mr Biden will be inaugurated as president on Wednesday. Although some claim they will never accept him as their president.
Alongside the new online warnings to avoid armed protests in Washington DC and elsewhere, there are a few posts by furious supporters of the president calling for ""guerrilla warfare"".
The lack of armed protests for now could be down to ""increased fear about crackdowns by law enforcement following the 6 January,"" says Alex Newhouse, research lead at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism in the US.
He also warns of a different kind of threat from the Capitol riots:
""The level of desensitisation to concepts like race war, civil war, and political violence that occurs in these chatrooms means that if even a tiny fraction of 1% of followers take it seriously, that could indicate a higher potential of individual acts of extreme violence.""
And what about the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which has been blamed for radicalising so many and whose members were among those that stormed the Capitol?
QAnon followers remain convinced that somehow Mr Trump, with the help of the military, will successfully overturn the outcome of the election on inauguration day.
They believe Mr Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used 1807 law that allows the president to deploy military forces inside the US.
There is no evidence to suggest this could happen.
Followers of the conspiracy have also been sharing false or doctored images and videos of the fencing around the Capitol building - built to ensure the safety of those attending the inauguration and avoid a repeat of the 6 January riots - with claims the fencing is in fact a military prison which will be used to entrap Mr Biden and members of the so-called ""deep state"".
There's also an increasing sense of paranoia. Groups on alternative platforms that openly called for violence on 6 January now worry aloud that they have been infiltrated by government agents or left-wing activists.
Owners and moderators of right-wing social media platforms have posted messages asking members not to post incitement to violence.
But violent threats against House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, whom the groups had hoped would overturn the election result, remain widespread.
The move away from mainstream platforms poses a risk, according to Mina al-Lami, jihadism specialist at BBC Monitoring, who sees parallels with Islamist militant groups who have been subject to similar crackdowns.
""Members of the fringe far-right may now slip under the radar into closed spaces which use end-to-end encryption,"" a very secure method of exchanging messages, she says. ""Their radicalisation goes unchecked and unmonitored.""
The social media giants acted to remove QAnon groups after the violence in Washington, but they have quickly rebuilt themselves elsewhere.
On Gab, groups dedicated to QAnon now boast more than 500,000 members. A similar new channel on Telegram has more than 100,000 subscribers.
Meanwhile, accounts spreading conspiracy theories and potentially inciting violence have emerged in surprising places. TikTok, the short-form video platform hugely popular among young people, has seen a flood of clips from pro-Trump militia groups.
TikTok videos from militia groups are concerning, says Ciaran O'Connor of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank focused on extremism and hate groups.
Users have been sharing footage of members preparing firearms, as well as promoting false claims that President Trump has activated the Insurrection Act.
Extremist supporters have been taking advantage of TikTok's slow moderation process, which means that videos can stay online for long periods of time before they are deleted for violating the network's terms of service, Mr O'Connor says.
Some of the more violent and conspiratorial pro-Trump groups may have been scattered across the internet following purges at mainstream platforms, but that doesn't mean they've gone away.
They realise they're under close scrutiny from the US authorities, but they're preparing to dig in for a long fight.

Thomas Brabbins was wearing no clothes and carrying just a mobile phone when he left his home in Huyton, Merseyside.
Officers had raided the Cherry Tree Road house and found more than Â£30,000 in cash and two Rolex watches worth more than Â£10,000 in June.
The 28-year-old was jailed for seven-and-a half-years at Liverpool Crown Court.
He is among several people jailed in the region as part of an international investigation into criminals using the Encrochat encrypted messaging service.
Brabbins admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis, possession of cannabis - including with the intent to supply - and possession of criminal property.
He was using the handle ""coastalsummer"" when he manufactured and distributed large quantities of the drugs from his home, Merseyside Police said.
He was released under investigation after his arrest but was later rearrested after being seen acting suspiciously in a car on 12 November.
The National Crime Agency said Encrochat is often used by criminals to trade drugs and guns.
It was infiltrated last summer, leading to more than 1,000 arrests, including about 70 held by officers in Merseyside.
Police compared the operation to ""cracking the Enigma code"" in their fight against organised crime.
Merseyside Police said about 60,000 users of Encrochat had been identified worldwide, with about 10,000 of them in the UK.
Det Sgt Anthony Meakins said: ""Brabbins thought that by using encrypted devices he could evade justice. He was wrong, and he won't be last to realise this.""

""To be ready, we launched a few weeks ago a study on a secure space-based connectivity system. The selected consortium consisting of European satellite manufacturers, operators and service providers, telco operators and launch service providers will study the possible design and development of this project.
""This will provide insights on the technical dimension, but also the governance structure, the financing, the missions, the exact scope. I expect their first feedback in April this year.""
The secure communications system would be the next flagship space project to come out of the EU after the Galileo satellite-navigation constellation and the Copernicus programme with its Earth observing Sentinel spacecraft.
EU officials have only spoken in the broadest terms about what they want to see from the new telecommunications project.
They talk about a mix of low, medium and geostationary satellites that use advanced quantum encryption, are interlinked with optical connectors, and which piggyback sensors that might also be used to monitor aviation and shipping - just as examples. But, they argue, fast, secure, low-latency, space-borne connectivity will be the must-have capability to enable a raft of coming technologies, such as self-driving cars.
Europe needs such a capability if it wants to stay globally competitive.
The primary motivation in the first instance, however, would be to fill those last ""not spots"" in member states where ground infrastructure is incapable of delivering broadband services - thought to be at least five million households.
Pressed on cost, EU officials told reporters on Tuesday that any estimate would have to wait on the industrial consortium's report in the spring. Nonetheless, experience says it would be in the billions of euros price bracket.
And as to where the money will come from to make it all happen, the preferred option seems to be some sort of public-private partnership.
The officials said the commission had some funds across its various directorates that it could call on, but that they expected industry, individual member states and the European Space Agency to invest in the system as well.
Whatever the system looks like and however it is funded, speed of implementation will be paramount.
The Starlink broadband mega-constellation, which is being built by US entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company, has already started offering ""beta"", or trial, broadband connections in Northern Europe; and OneWeb, owned by Indian conglomerate Bharti Global and the British government, hopes to have an initial offering for its Northern European customers later this year.
""From the first idea about Galileo through to the first operational service in Europe, it has taken 20 years; we don't have 20 years [for this new project],"" observed Jean-Marc Nasr, the head of Airbus Space Systems, which leads the feasibility consortium.
""Speed is of the essence here. The idea of the European space infrastructure has been on the table since early 2020. We cannot have the first service in 2040. If we do that, we are dead.
""We have to have the service operational at the end of this decade at the latest. And this requires all of us to work as a team to deliver the best competitive service and technical background to Europe.""
There is talk of having the entire network in place by the end of the new EU multi-annual budget period, which is 2027.
One issue of supreme importance for the implementation of the network will be securing the radio frequencies on which it will operate, as pointed out by Riadh Cammoun, vice president of public and regulatory affairs at the Franco-Italian satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space.
""We need funding, we need a vision, we need leadership, but also we need frequency rights to sustain the launch of a European low-Earth orbit constellation,"" he told the conference.
The commission said it had been working for some months already to try to secure those frequencies. The allocation and use of satellite frequencies is negotiated through the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).",Yes

Quantum cryptography is touted as being ""unbreakable""




Perfect secrecy has come a step closer with the launch of the world's first computer network protected by unbreakable quantum encryption at a scientific conference in Vienna.
The network connects six locations across Vienna and in the nearby town of St Poelten, using 200 km of standard commercial fibre optic cables.
Quantum cryptography is completely different from the kinds of security schemes used on computer networks today.
These are typically based on complex mathematical procedures which are extremely hard for outsiders to crack but not impossible given sufficient computing resources or time.
But quantum systems use the laws of quantum theory, which have been shown to be inherently unbreakable.
	

	
		    
			    







Real breakthroughs are not found because you want to develop some new technology, but because you are curious and want to find out how the world is
 


Anton Zeilinger, Vienna University





The basic idea of quantum cryptography was worked out 25 years ago by Charles Bennett of IBM and Gilles Brassard of Montreal University, who was in Vienna to see the network in action.
""All quantum security schemes are based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, on the fact that you cannot measure quantum information without disturbing it,"" he explained.
""Because of that, one can have a communications channel between two users on which it's impossible to eavesdrop without creating a disturbance. An eavesdropper would create a mark on it. That was the key idea.""
In practice this means using the ultimate quantum objects: photons, the ""atoms of light"". Incredibly faint beams of light equating to single photons fired a million times a second raced between the nodes in the Vienna network.
Each node, housed in a different Siemens office (Siemens has provided the fibre links), contains a small rack of electronics - boxes about the size of a PC - and a handful of sensitive light detectors.
Numerical key
From the detected photons, a totally secret numerical key can be distilled, which encodes the users' data much like the keys used in normal computer networks do.
The advantage is that no-one else can know the key without revealing themselves.
As we saw in the demonstration, when an intruder did try to listen in on the quantum exchange, photons became scrambled, and a rise in the error rate at the node detectors signalled the attack. The system automatically shut down without being compromised.",Possibly not

The campaigns involved Hamas' military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group (IS).
US officials said about $2m (Â£1.5m) in cryptocurrency had been recovered.
Hundreds of cryptocurrency accounts, four websites and four Facebook accounts were also seized, the justice department announced in a statement.
""These actions represent the government's largest-ever seizure of cryptocurrency in the terrorism context,"" the department said.
The al-Qassam Brigades used social media and its official websites to solicit bitcoin donations according to the justice department.
It said government agents seized control of one website to redirect payments away from the group, which is the armed wing of the Palestinian militant Islamist organisation Hamas. Search warrants have been issued against people based in the US who donated.
Al-Qaeda militants based in Syria, meanwhile, sought donations to purchase weapons via the messaging app Telegram.
The justice department said IS had used a website and Facebook pages to sell fake Covid-19 personal protective equipment to collect funds.

801,90,encryption,"Capcom hack: Up to 350,000 people's information stolen",16 November 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54958782,"Video-game-maker Capcom has warned a ransomware attack might have compromised gamers' personal information.
Up to 350,000 people could be affected, it said, and some of its own financial information had been stolen.
The Japanese developer is best known for franchises such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Monster Hunter.
A week-and-a-half earlier, it had said there was no indication customer information had been accessed.
But in an update on Monday, Capcom confirmed its servers had been hit by an attack on 2 November.
Ransomware is malicious software that typically threatens to block a victim's access to their own records unless a blackmail payment is made.
In this case, the attackers digitally scrambled some of the data on Capcom's servers, making it impossible to view or amend, and destroyed some files outright.
The Ragnar Locker hacker group had then demanded to be paid to undo the encryption involved, Capcom said.
On Ragnor Locker's dark-net webpage, the hackers didn't just post Capcom's data but also an ominous message.
In broken English they wrote the Japanese company didn't ""make a right decision and save data from leakage"".
This - and the fact Capcom is openly talking about the hack - suggests the company chose not to pay the cyber-criminals' extortion demand.
Many, including law enforcement, would actually see this as absolutely the right decision.
For 18 months, police the world over have been desperately imploring ransomware victims not to pay hackers.
The groups have made millions from companies, which often feel they have no other option but to fork out.
But it seems Capcom has found a way through without yielding.
No doubt the incident has affected the firm's reputation and some sensitive data is already surfacing online.
But reading the disappointment in Ragnor Locker's statement is refreshing and rare.
So far, Capcom has confirmed only nine people's personal information was definitely compromised, all current or former employees.
But up to 350,000 customers, business partners, and other employees might also be affected, it said.
Although, it could not be sure because its own logs had been ""lost as a result of the attack"".
The information includes different combinations of names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers and email addresses, depending on why the data was gathered.
For example, some was from Japanese customer support and some from the American Capcom store or e-sports operation.
""None of the at-risk data contains credit-card information,"" Capcom's statement said.
""All online transactions... are handled by a third-party service provider.
""And as such, Capcom does not maintain any such information internally.""
The company also said it was safe for gamers to continue to play its games online and to use its websites.
Police have been notified, as have the Japanese and UK data-protection watchdogs.
""Capcom would once again like to reiterate its deepest apologies for any complications or concerns caused by this incident,"" it said.
""As a company that handles digital content, it is regarding this incident with the utmost seriousness.""",Yes

803,92,encryption,Wikileaks encryption use offers 'legal challenge',19 August 2010,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11026659,"A novel use of encryption by whistle-blowing website Wikileaks could ""challenge the legal system for years to come,"" according to an influential observer of the hacking community.
Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600 The Hacker Quarterly magazine, made his comments in reference to an encrypted file recently posted on the site.
Some suspect the file - as yet unopened - contains further sensitive material.
It has been reposted around the web and is available for anyone to download. So far, it has beeen downloaded 100,000 times.
""If you release it in encrypted form, nobody really knows if you've released it or not - or even what the material is,"" Mr Goldstein told BBC News.
""Then, if something happens to you, all it takes is the revelation of a simple spoken phrase known by a select group of people and everyone who has this mystery file now has all of the secrets.""
Wikileaks recently published 76,000 secret US military logs detailing military actions in Afghanistan; an act the US authorities described as highly irresponsible.
The website now says it will release 15,000 further sensitive documents, once it has completed a review aimed at minimising the risk that the release could put people's lives in danger.
The site came under criticism after it released the first tranche for endangering the lives of informants or others named in the documents.
The release of the logs has led many to wonder what action the US might take against Wikileaks.
Now it seems the site may be using encryption as insurance against legal and other threats to the information it holds.
The insurance.aes256 file has been posted alongside the already published leaked war logs and can be downloaded by anyone.
From the file name, it is believed that it has been encrypted using the AES256 algorithm - described as ""extremely strong"" by Professor Whitfield Diffie, of the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway University, London.
Prof Diffie believes that AES256, which he says has been ""extensively studied"" could prove too tough even for US intelligence agencies to break.
While no-one knows what the insurance file contains, this has not prevented the contents becoming a matter of considerable speculation.
Some suspect that the file contains a further leaked US military video, others that it is another tranche of US military logs - perhaps this time from Iraq. Or it could  just be an imaginative bluff.
Even the name of the directory in which it is held - ""straw-glass-and-bottle"" - has prompted discussion and debate online.
Speaking at a recent event at London's Frontline Club, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told attendees how the use of encryption could help overcome legal efforts to prevent publication.
Mr Assange told the BBC that Wikileaks had often distributed encrypted material among its members in order to protect it.
""We have over a long period of time distributed encrypted backups of material we have yet to release,"" he told the gathering.
""All we have to do is release the password to that material and it is instantly available,"" he said.
By publishing the encrypted documents publicly, Mr Assange said Wikileaks was protecting material of historical value.
""That duty to history is something that weighs heavily with us. If you had the Stasi archive in your pocket, that is a very heavy pocket indeed,"" he said.
""We take precautions to make sure that sort of material is not going to disappear from history regardless of the sort of threats to this organisation.""
But with the ""insurance file"" Wikileaks has taken the unusual step of making an encrypted backup - if that is indeed what it is - publicly available online.
Emanuel Goldstein told the BBC: ""Julian is smart. He always has a backup, which is the rule of thumb in this community.""
But he believes this goes further than just a need to preserve information.
""It's a fascinating tactic and one which will challenge the legal system for years to come.""
In Mr Goldstein's view, any attempt now to seize or prevent publication of material held by Wikileaks will be self-defeating because thousands of copies will already have been distributed world wide.
It is, he says, ""a tactic of intelligence to ward off the inevitable clampdown.""
But Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation is less convinced the file represents a challenge to the US government.
""I don't see it as a challenge, as much as being open about what's going on,"" she told the BBC.
In Ms Cohn's view the idea of circulating encrypted copies of information to keep it safe is well-established.
The tactic, according to Ms Cohn, has been used in the past by human rights groups and other organisations.
She points to projects like Freenet, which use encryption and wide distribution of data to resist censorship.
""Wikileaks is doing the same basic thing in a more directly political context and using encryption to allow them to be more open about it on the front end.""
For Prof Diffie, the release of information in this way does open up interesting possibilities.
""In a sense communications networks can be defined entirely by who has cryptographic keys, and I think a lot of networks will work that way in the future.""
That's a view which will not be good news for those trying to prevent groups sharing and publishing leaked material.
""I think that the people who are trying to shut down Wikileaks are going to have to accept this as a fact of reality that cryptography allows you to do this kind of thing,"" Prof Diffie said.",Yes

The Harris Federation, which runs 50 primary and secondary academies in and around London, said it had temporarily disabled email while it deals with the cyber-attack.
Data on the systems has been encrypted and hidden by the attackers.
Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a warning that hackers are targeting schools.
âWe are at least the fourth multi-academy trust to have been targeted in March,â a statement on the Harris Federation website said.
âThis is a highly sophisticated attack that will have a significant impact on our academies but it will take time to uncover the exact details of what has or has not happened, and to resolve.
âAs a precaution, we have temporarily disabled our email system.â
Any devices which the Harris Federation have given to pupils have also been disabled, the statement added.
However, schools have recently returned to in-person learning as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions - meaning students can still attend classes.
Harris Federation schools break up for Easter later this week.
Its statement did not detail what information or data has been compromised, and it has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.
The trust is working with âa specialised firm of cyber-technology consultantsâ, the National Crime Agency and the NCSC to resolve the issues.
The NCSC said it has ""recently alerted the education sector to the significant threat posed by ransomware attacks"" and urged schools and colleges to follow its advice to protect themselves online.
It used to be the case that ransomware groups concentrated their efforts on large multinational companies.
Big corporate budgets and potential business interruption mean large ransom payouts.
Publicly funded schools and colleges are therefore an odd and particularly cruel target.
One hacker group recently posted part of their negotiation conversation with another unnamed institution on the dark net.
It made for grim reading, and once again showed me how ruthless they are.
At one stage, when the hackers demanded $15m, the school wrote: ""Sir, please, this is NOT a business with profits. We operate much like a charity operates. This is a state-funded school, our salaries are paid for by taxing the people that live in the state. We have no idea how you think we can afford this.""

Revenues leaped 355% to $663.5m (Â£496.3m) for the three months ending 31 July, beating analysts' expectations of $500.5m.
Profits soared to $186m, while customer growth rose 458%, compared with the same period in 2019.
Video conferencing apps remain crucial due to the increase in remote working.
Zoom's shares hit a record high on Monday, closing at $325.10, as the firm raised its annual revenue forecast by more than 30% to the range of $2.37bn-$2.39bn, from its previous projection of $1.78bn-$1.80bn.
Key to Zoom's success was its ability to add paying customers - high-budget corporate clients - as opposed to those who use its services for free.
The company said that its large customers - firms that generated more than $100,000 in revenue in the past year - doubled to 988 during the quarter.
Zoom, together with rivals Cisco Webex and Microsoft Teams, have all seen a surge in usage of their video conferencing platforms since coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed by multiple countries in March.
But Zoom's soaring popularity has also strained its infrastructure, with some outages last week as schools in many parts of the US resumed classes virtually.
Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees.
Zoom has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use.",Yes

Several countries have criticised China for imposing a new security law, which they say threatens the territory's long-standing autonomy.
The announcements are likely to put pressure on Apple to do likewise.
While the others' services are blocked in mainland China, Apple's are not.
However, Facebook, Google and Twitter do generate revenue from selling advertising to Chinese clients.
Apple complied with the majority of requests it received from Hong Kong's government between January and June, before the new law came into effect, according to the firm's latest transparency report.
Microsoft - which has also previously handed over data about its users to Hong Kong's authorities, and maintains a significant presence in mainland China - has not announced a change in policy either.
The BBC has asked the two companies for comment.
Chat app Telegram - headquartered in London - was first to announce plans to halt co-operation.
""We understand the right of privacy of our Hong Kong users,"" the firm told the Hong Kong Free Press on Sunday.
""Accordingly, Telegram does not intend to process any data requests related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached in relation to the ongoing political changes in the city.""
Facebook followed saying it would stop considering the requests, ""pending further assessment"" of the human rights issues.
No personal information about users in the region was held at, or disclosed from, its Hong Kong office, it added.
""We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,"" Facebook said.
WhatsApp - which is owned by Facebook - said it ""believes in the right for people to have a private conversation online"" and ""we remain committed to providing private and secure messaging services to our users in Hong Kong"".
Both platforms are blocked in mainland China but have benefited from Hong Kong's much broader access to the internet under its freedoms as a special administrative region.
Google said it paused production on any new data requests when the new rules came into effect last week.
""We'll continue to review the details of the new law,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC.
Twitter said it acted likewise.
WhatsApp has end-to-end encryption enabled by default - so it cannot read, or share with police officers, messages sent between two users.
On Facebook Messenger, however, encryption is not the default option - it has to be manually switched on by users.
Both platforms say they may disclose user data, in accordance with the law of the country in question.
But WhatsApp adds successful requests for this information must meet ""internationally recognised standards including human rights, due process, and the rule of law"".
In the US, both platforms require a subpoena to provide ""basic subscriber records"" such as the person's name, IP (internet protocol) address and email address.
Extra information about the subscriber may require a court order.
And a search warrant is needed for account contents:
Hong Kong, formerly a British territory, was handed back to China in 1997, on the condition it would enjoy special freedoms for 50 years.
The UK says China has now broken that agreement and is offering citizenship to as many as three million Hong Kong residents.
Meanwhile, the United States - where most of the tech firms involved are headquartered - is considering whether to remove Hong Kong's favourable trading terms.
The security laws introduce new crimes, including conspiring with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government or Hong Kong authorities, with penalties of up to life in prison.

Police Scotland has spent more than Â£500,000 buying 41 desktop-sized machines which override encryption on devices.
The move has already been delayed amid concerns the technology may be unlawful.
The force insisted the devices would significantly speed up investigations.
Phones now form a major part of criminal investigations and forensic experts in Scotland examine about 15,000 a year.
The police devices - known as ""cyber kiosks"" - will plug into phones or tablets and trained operators will then look for information relevant to an investigation.
Only information held on devices, such as social media messages or call logs, can be accessed by Police Scotland and the force says all logs of the data captured are deleted after an examination.
Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""Increases in the involvement of digital devices in investigations mean that demand on digital forensic examinations is higher than ever.
""Current limitations, however, mean the devices of victims, witnesses and suspects can be taken for months at a time, even if it later transpires that there is no worthwhile evidence on them.
""By quickly identifying devices which do and do not contain evidence, we can minimise the intrusion on people's lives and provide a better service to the public.""
The force has published a video to explain more about the new devices to the public.
Seized units being examined by the police will include those handed over voluntarily by victims and witnesses, as well as those obtained under the authority of a judicial warrant, statutory power or following a suspect's arrest.
The technology was first trialled in both Edinburgh and Stirling in 2016 using phones and SIM cards which had been legally seized by frontline officers.
However, this came in for criticism, including from Holyrood's justice sub-committee, after it emerged members of the public whose phones were seized and searched were not made aware they were taking part in the trial.
Police Scotland has since ""acknowledged that the previous trials fell below the standard that would be expected of the service"" but the force said concerns about the use of personal data have been the subject of ""extensive consultation and scrutiny"".
The full rollout of the devices, which have seen 410 frontline officers trained to use them, is expected to be completed by May.
A number of groups, including the Scottish Human Rights Commission and Privacy International, have argued that the legal basis for device examination has not been made sufficiently clear.
Clare Connelly, of the Faculty of Advocates, has previously said she does not believe the technology complies with European law.
Police Scotland said these concerns had been addressed.

Shin Bet, the country's internal security service, said the man had been in discussions with Iranian intelligence to recruit Israeli Arabs to carry out attacks.
He has been charged with ""infringement of the security of Israel"".
Israel and Iran have been arch-foes since the 1979 Iranian revolution, with Iran denying Israel's right to exist.
The man who has been charged cannot be named for legal reasons.
Shin Bet said when the man was arrested last month, he was in possession of an encryption device and a computer hard drive. The agency said he had been paid to provide Iran with information on important sites in Israel.
According to court files the accused was in contact with a Lebanese man who is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group. They allegedly met in two separate locations.
He is also alleged to have met two people in Budapest who said they belonged to the Iranian security forces.
In that meeting he provided the pair with information meant to help Iran ""harm Israel"", Haaretz newspaper reports.

Cardiff Crown Court heard he thought he was sending hundreds of images to his girlfriend over the course of a year.
But they were in fact sent to Darren Hart, 29, from Glasgow, who has been jailed for eight-and-a-half years.
Hart, who pleaded guilty to 10 charges of sex offences, befriended the boy through online gaming, then created a fake persona.
Prosecution barrister Matthew Roberts told the court the boy was told he had to send the images because the woman had been captured in America and ""was being held by a gang who would hurt and rape her if he didn't do what was being demanded of him"".
The court heard the boy's parents removed computer devices from him after concerns were raised at school and indecent images were found on them.
But his abuser Hart, managed to send him an internet-enabled mobile phone so he could continue sending the extreme images, which were sent through multiple encrypted social media accounts to the fictitious girlfriend.
Mr Roberts said the boy had been ""totally brainwashed by the defendant"" into making hundreds of images and videos of sexual acts of ""extreme self-harming at the direction of the defendant"".
Hart was arrested while on his way, with his stepfather, to meet the boy in south Wales and to ""remove him for sexual purposes to Scotland"" without the knowledge of his parents.
Hart's phone had 364 images and 192 videos of the boy along with a note containing a ""shopping list of requirements"" of acts for the boy to carry out.
The court heard that the boy saw his family as ""the enemy"", although their relationship had been repaired recently.
In a victim impact statement, the boy's father told the court of his ""horror that this abuse could be carried out anonymously from behind a keyboard"".
He added: ""I shudder at what happened and what could have happened if the defendant had succeeded in taking away my son"".
The boy said he had hundreds of physical scars as a result and had carried out the acts because he felt that his girlfriend was ""in peril and danger"".
He added that he felt he had lost a lot of his childhood and found it hard to trust people.
Defence barrister Susan Ferrier told the court that Darren Hart had an ""introverted character"" with no history of offending.
She said that was a ""lonely man who struggled with his mental health"" and who had been in a secret relationship with his stepfather since he was 18.
She said the offending had occurred in a gap in that relationship. He pleaded guilty to 10 charges of sexual offences at an earlier hearing.
Recorder Timothy Brennan said Darren Hart had committed ""multiple offences over a long period by cruel deception"" and that the case was ""so astonishing, were it not known to be true, it would be difficult to believe"".
He said Hart had shown an inability to realise how serious the offences were and that there was a ""significant risk"" of further offending.
Hart was sentenced to eight-and-a half years in prison with an extended period of four years on licence. He must also comply with a sexual harm prevention order indefinitely.",Yes
810,99,encryption,Memory trick breaks PC encryption,5 March 2008,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7275407.stm,"Scientists have shown that it is possible to recover the key that unscrambles data from a PC's memory. 

It was previously thought that data held in so-called ""volatile memory"" was only retained for a few seconds after the machine was switched off. 

But the team found that data including encryption keys could be held and retrieved for up to several minutes.


""It was widely believed that when you cut the power to the computer that the information in the volatile memory would disappear, and what we found was that was not the case,"" Professor Edward Felten of the University of Princeton told BBC World Service's Digital Planet programme. 

Volatile memory is typically used in random access memory (RAM), which is used as temporary storage for programs and data when the computer is switched on. 

Deep sleep

Disc encryption is the main method by which companies and governments protect sensitive information. 

""The key to making it work is to keep the encryption key secret,"" explained Professor Felten. 

Encryption has recently become a hot topic after a number of laptops containing personal records were lost or stolen. 












Simply locking your screen or switching to 'suspend' or 'hibernate' mode will not provide adequate protection

""What we have found was that the encryption keys needed to access these encrypted files were available in the memory of laptops,"" he said. 

""The information was available for seconds or minutes."" 

In theory, this is enough time for a hacker or attacker to retrieve the key from the memory chips. 

""The real worry is that someone will get hold of your laptop either while it is turned on or while it is in sleeping or hibernation mode,"" said Professor Felten. 

In these modes the laptop is not running, but information is still stored in RAM to allow it to ""wake up"" quickly. 

""The person will get the laptop, cut the power and then re-attach the power, and by doing that will get access to the contents of memory - including the critical encryption keys."" 

Cool running

Switching the machine off and on is critical to any attack. 

""When it comes out of sleep mode the operating system is there and it is trying to protect this data,"" explained Professor Felten. 

But a full power-down followed by a swift re-start removes this protection. 

""By cutting the power and then bringing it back, the adversary can get rid of the operating system and get access directly to the memory."" 

Professor Felten and his team found that cooling the laptop enhanced the retention of data in memory chips. 

""The information stays in the memory for much longer - 10 minutes or more,"" he said. 

For example, where information stays in a computer for around 15 seconds under normal conditions, a laptop cooled to about -50C will keep information in its memory for 10 minutes or more. 

Professor Felten said that the best way to protect a computer was to shut it down fully several minutes before going into any situation in which the machine's physical security could be compromised. 

""Simply locking your screen or switching to 'suspend' or 'hibernate' mode will not provide adequate protection,"" he added. 

""It does cast some doubt on the value of encryption. I think that over time the encryption products will adapt to this and they will find new ways of protecting information.""

811,100,encryption,Coronavirus: Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars,1 April 2020,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52115434,"The videoconferencing app Zoom has come under fresh high-level scrutiny as its popularity soars during the coronavirus pandemic.
New York's attorney general has written to the firm raising concerns over its ability to cope with the rise in users.
Zoom is now being used by millions of people for work and leisure, as lockdowns are imposed in many countries.
But its data security and privacy measures have been questioned.
The letter from the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James asked Zoom whether it had reviewed its security measures since its popularity surged. It also pointed out that in the past the app had been slow to address issues.
In response to a request from the BBC for comment, a company spokesperson said: ""Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously.
""During the Covid-19 pandemic, we are working around-the-clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools, and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational. We appreciate the New York Attorney General's engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information,"" it added.
Users have flocked to Zoom as governments around the world ordered large parts of their populations to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. It is now ranked as the number two and number one app in the UK and US, respectively.
Zoom has had security flaws in the past, including a vulnerability which allowed an attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users and hijack shared screens. Another saw Mac users forced into calls without their knowledge.
It also doesn't offer end-to-end encryption, according to online news publication The Intercept. This is encryption that should mean no-one other than participants can see a meeting.
Zoom told it: ""Currently, it is not possible to enable E2E encryption for Zoom video meetings."" This means Zoom can access the video and audio of meetings, it reported.
Because Zoom uses email domains to identify users who may be in the same company, the service will sometimes allow small internet service providers' customers to see each others' private data, reported Vice's tech website Motherboard.
The company told Motherboard that it regularly updates a  list of private email providers to avoid this.
Zoom has also been criticised for its ""attendee tracking"" feature, which, when enabled, lets the host of the Zoom call check if participants are clicking away from the main Zoom window during a call.
More recently, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week tweeted a picture of himself chairing a Cabinet meeting using Zoom, leading to questions about how secure it was.
The company has pushed back at those concerns, telling the BBC: ""Globally, 2,000 institutions ranging from the world's largest financial services companies to leading telecommunications providers, government agencies, universities, healthcare and telemedicine practices have done exhaustive security reviews of our user, network and data centre layers confidently selecting Zoom for complete deployment.""
""We are in close communication with the UK Ministry of Defence and National Cyber Security Centre and are focused on providing the documentation they need.""",Yes
